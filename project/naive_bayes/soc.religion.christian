I knowthat romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yethebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,do you still think that just believing is enough?'Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselvesand not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold tohim (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone whoknows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of Jamesin conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.-- in Christ,Will----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Adam================================================================================| Adam John Cooper|"Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings || (612) 696-7521|   who thought themselves good simply because  || acooper@macalstr.edu|they had no claws."       |================================================================================| "Understand one another?

I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believethey're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understandthat you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also followsthat all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you wantto say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (diea final death))   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, andnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true thatthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'llnever know I'm dead. Hmmm... >  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal,    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died: "At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now." ?    Consider the following statement: "At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now."    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having anyconscious experience whatsoever).     You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects tobe conscious throughout this eternity.     Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply theproduct of propaganda ("Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?"It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct allanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get theidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort ofsuper-survival.  >and it's a lot worse than Heaven.  That's the only comparison that matters.    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying toconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. "Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?" asked anEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said somethingto the effect of, "Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?Scram." I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants anaccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no immortality). >Alan Terlep    "Incestuous vituperousness">Oakland University, Rochester, MI>atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu   --Melissa Eggertsen>Rushing in where angels fear to tread.

Can he be impartial     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or     will he assume the superstition of his parents     when questioning? I've often found it to be the case that the theist     will stick to some kind of superstition when     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,     and the other theists alike.  All assume that     their mothers and fathers were right in the     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief     search for their god.     Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or     aspects of the same religion, but overall the     majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"     was behind the universe's existence.  I've     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice     versa, I've known Christians who were once     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout     their transition from one faith to another,     they've kept this belief in some form of higher     "being."  Why?     It usually all has to do with how the child is     brought up.  From the time he is born, the     theist is brought up with the notion of the     "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.     He is also told that to question this (as     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.     Thus, by the time he is able to read the     scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a     matter of course.     But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to     inculcate the child the "right" readings of     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to     explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."     Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and     "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath     of some sort, and the child must learn to put     away his brain when the matter concerns God.     All of this has some considerable effect on the     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the      superstitions he's been taught are nearly     impossible to remove.     All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that     God *does* exist and look at everything from     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most     theists can somewhat, especially when presented     with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption     of God's existence and question it impartially?

On the other hand,>an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.There are a lot of people running around saying "God told me this" and "God told me that" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and othersheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  Hesaid someone told him, "The Lord gave me a song."  He said that it wasthe worst song he had ever heard."I know why he gave you that song," Murillo said, "He didn't want it anymore."But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to theidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spiritin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the firstto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the onewe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an "M" whoprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecyhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other propheciesbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, "He never prophesiesanything good about me."  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two ofAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophetbefore he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with>knowledge?I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets propheciesin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, "And his bishoprick let anothertake" concerning Judas office.A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying aboutwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joelabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scripturalprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdomcan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are oftenconsidered miracles.

(David Hammerslag) writes:>This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile>the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection>people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?Here is the short answer: because onlycertain marriages are recorded in Heaven.Now for the long answer:In Doctrine and Covenants section 132, the chapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes,plural marriage), the distinction betweensealings under the priesthood and other marriages is revealed.  When "the children of this world marry, or aregiven in marriage" when they receive "the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor aregiven in marriage" (Luke 20:34-35).Jesus was simply teaching that marriages "untildeath do you part" are not in force after death.However, the Doctrine and Covenants continues describing eternal marriage.D&C 132:19   And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, andby the new and everlasting covenant, and it issealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise,by him who is anointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity AI]and shall be of full force when they are out ofthe world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds foreverand ever.The Lord told Peter "whatsoever thou shalt bindon earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matt 16:19).Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to perform sealings?Peter thought so because he taught that husbandsand wives were "heirs *together* of the grace oflife" (1 Peter 3:7)."In order to obtain the highest" (degree ofcelestial glory), a man must enter into thisorder of the priesthood" (D&C 131:2).When a man and wife are sealed they truly become "one flesh" because their eternal "increase" (destinies) are enjoined completely.Our Father has an eternal companion (and maybemore because of the plural marriage conditionsof the law) who participated in our creationand is equally concerned with our progress here.There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine.If fact, the only mention of our Mother is inone verse of a hymn written early in the historyof the Church:    O My Father    I had learned to call thee Father,    Through thy Spirit from on high,    But, until the key of knowledge    Was restored, I knew not why.    In the heav'ns are parents single?    No, the thought makes reason stare!    Truth is reason; truth eternal    Tells me I've a mother there.Why don't we hear more about our Mother?1.  Because our Father presides under Priesthoodauthority (which is not a calling for Her);2.  Because we don't all (necessarily) have thesame Mother it would be confusing for worship;3.  Because our Father wishes to withhold Hername and titles because of how some peopledegrade sacred things.A IDLER

He wrote it around1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalousactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut allthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.Joe Buehler...Schism and DisobedienceAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in arefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of theChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whateverthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, hemust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit tothe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power ofjurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make itclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts ofdisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at thebeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of Americanbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear inthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire deTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who iscertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schismand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. FatherCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existenceof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejectionof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept adecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does notconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopediaexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have tointend "to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies."  Itadds that "not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess thischaracter it must include besides the transgression of the command ofthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command."Not onlydoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority andhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop madehis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We prayfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrationslast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul IIthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that heis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favorheresy."...Intrinsically Schismatic?The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is inschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate isan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such aconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This isnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act itwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (seeCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty toexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismaticchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishopsdiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvreas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and theillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercisean apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of thebishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers ofjurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose ofensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations andalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any waythe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration ofbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than theordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of theprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the RomanPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting theChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed inresponse.It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's criticsthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vaticanhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is notso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code ofCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled"Penalties for Specific Offenses" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). Thefirst part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of theChurch" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, togetherwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offensesagainst the unity of the Church.But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of thiscanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense againstreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in hisexcommunication comes from the third section of "Penalties forSpecific Offenses" which is entitled "Usurpation of EcclesialFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise" (De Munerum EcclesiasticorumUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question isCanon 1382, which reads: "A bishop who consecrates someone bishop andthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without apontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)excommunication reserved to the Holy See."The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offenseof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparablesmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainlyjustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurateparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter hadbeen convicted of first degree murder.I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinionof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyerswithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiatedthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. FatherPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the InstitutCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeursactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was notexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiasticalfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop whichconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon theillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers ofthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing aparallel Church.Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for theAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrationsin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard toimagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.....It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecratingbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the leastintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic andwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly thatthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him toconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. CanonLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes thatthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without theseconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that itcould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurredexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelatesas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannotexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against agreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted tothe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una VoceAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and heknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has nogreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre andthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from astatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February1989 Remnant merits careful study:    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist "obstinancies." And from the    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has "an    erroneous concept of Tradition." If this were so, Cardinal    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:    "Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern    and shares it."

I must havetrashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the nextday & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post heplaced in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them beforerealizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; heapologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to bea snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neitherchanged his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now heknows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And allthat I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.I believe the reason that he & I "click" instead of "bash" heads is becauseI see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintainingthe status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject Godthan he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people fromthe true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to theworld society.  The "kitchen of heaven" was all we had to look forward toduring the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still existstoday.  I, too, have rejectedan aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too muchhypocricy exists behind the walls of "God's house" beginning with theimages of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday &raise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home whereI can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don't see it happening anytimesoon.Sherlette

Attempts to see each other end disastrously, withhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imaginedslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'llhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I'veseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keepthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contactwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is hischoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have arelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painfulrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, "Whybe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuseto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides tocome back." It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go onwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best Icould think of.   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't goingto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was theoutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed andraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, andin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation wasbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all theallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would notquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of theirrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hungup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this isthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as ifshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have thebreak out in the open and done with.     I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, forpersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping theirchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at mybrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or usthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying toappease an unappeasable,emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things willchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-righteous over this bit of proof that they can't "get away" with treatingus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for evenbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped ina horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--orthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustratedbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives meup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am notfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besettingvices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internalmental chatter enough to listen for God.)  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Isthis a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can Iconquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him? Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, longpost: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, andcharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up onmy own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help himand can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail orpost. Thank you.

He thinks that he mustearn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitledto it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has alwaysbeen loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he ishis father's son.We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point.

Protestants emphasize conversion,experience of the Holy Spirit, and use of the Bible.  This is intendedto make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own,and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy andother Christians.  I can't speak for Catholics and Orthodox, but Ibelieve they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeatwhat they are told.  I admit that this isn't always successful -- wecertainly see young people join our church because at that age parentsexpect it.  But most of our members do seem quite able and willing tomake judgements for themselves, and have a commitment that comes outof their own experience.  Unfortunately, it's the nature of Usenetthat doctrinal disagreements get emphasized, so it looks like we spendmost of our time dealing with doctrine.  That's certainly not myexperience of the way Christians really live.  --clh]

If, on the other hand, this is not a matter    of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the   Pope is the legal head of the church.   In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice   but to obey.This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying ismore or less heresy.  You might call it "infallibilism".  It's theidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific andwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he canmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.A couple historical examples come to mind.Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of theEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigningPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  BishopGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (thoughmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, evenwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would justcollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  BishopGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the BeatificVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be adefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around todefining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholicdoctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  Inthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, herecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of theChurch.If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of suchsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), youwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fallinto heresy or schism.The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Popemust be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith.A Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up theCatholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have nolegal *or* moral force.

I think basically the reasoning was that thetradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin wasmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virginfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born witha predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predispositionbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When sciencediscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume thatMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemedto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, thatbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT havemade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to sayingthat they are infallible.Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us willprobably agree.In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if anypart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing "Thereis no way out of the loop."Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, buthe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphraseSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argumentleads to relativism.As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as falsebecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just becauseyou dislike them.  `REXLEX' wrote:>  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' haswritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he doesnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it. *There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to thepoint at hand:>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be> experienced and it is verifiable.I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  Ihave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim tobe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but Ido claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning aboutthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlierarticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trustedin very limited circumstances.>  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute> about a thing.But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your ownreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include aperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,exactly, "This is my body."We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutelytrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, thepossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We donot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking ofTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passageusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we knowthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (Thisis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to befallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of isthat Jesus said "This is my body."  Beyond that, once we start making updoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, weget into trouble.Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certainof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, theycannot be certain.That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us knowthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do notbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never leadthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing ishardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that youare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally tryingto cover them up.I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and whatthings we are only "very confident" of.  For example, we might say that weknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  Butother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblicalthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we arevery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or actingas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous. *`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, byFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think thatMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebodyelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, byLudwig Wittgenstein.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.

We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  Wehave been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonableinterpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about thewoman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is theAntichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman representsBabylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are someviews on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the sameBabylon in as in chapter 17?  The Catholic church?Hate to step on toes.thanks-------- Jimmy Buddenberg       INTERNET:  jbuddenberg@vax.cns.muskingum.eduMuskingum College [Reading this imagery as the Roman Catholic Church was certainlycommon in earlier Protestant writers.  A lot of us find that franklyembarassing now, though some of our readers will certainly advocatesuch a position.  The problem is that the description makes it look alot like a political entity.  It's associated with kings, controlsworld commerce, is seated on seven mountains (17:9 -- recall that Romeis traditionally regarded as built on seven hills).  If it's a church,then it's not the current Roman Catholic church, but a church that hasbeen taken over by the anti-Christ and merged with the state, turninginto something rather different than it is now.  Presumably in such ascenario the true Catholics are among those who are persecuted.  Giventhe overall impression that Satan is pretending to be an angel oflight, and the true church is a persecuted remnant, I think the mostconsistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-Christwould be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of boththe Protestant and Catholic traditions, but that the true spiritualdescendants of both Peter and the Reformers are equally beingpersecuted.  --clh]

Stuff like "The word `numerology' adds up to 28,and the word appears 28 times in the posting!  Such elegant planning!Further, the word `truth' ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using thesenumerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!"(These examples are made up by me just as examples.)I really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showingthat these patterns can be found in just about anything.

Watson) asks: > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?        The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the paganwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is "what isthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?"  When phrasedthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiatelyapparent what my objection to "celebrating" her would be.  > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.       No, you are thinking perhaps of "Ressurection Sunday" I think. (Though I'm not too crazy about the word "Sunday", but I certainly likethis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast ofFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day followingthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modernparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrectionon the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it allover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sundayfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblicalmethods?  > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?       So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whoregoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep thatwhore out of the discussion.  > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of > words we are going to have to drop.

Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people areboth "sinister" and "gauche" so we probably will have some objections fromthat quarter as well.  > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the > resurrection is "Pa^ques"--this is etymologically related > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.

What happened to "there is > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for > all are one in Christ Jesus"?       Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's "slave"returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than uponPhilemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different "rules" thatapply to them as well?  Or if there is no more "male and female" can Adamand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there aredifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation inMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life. ---------------------------------------[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as itseems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe isnew -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about thisargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days ofthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  SomeChristians prefer to refer to "first day", "second day", etc.  Howeverthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The questionseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary showsas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think whenthey use it is different.Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves bedangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean thecelebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convincethem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess runthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's mindsbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear thatthis is a healthy thing.--clh]

Thus, some atheism might result from >broken-ness.I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and followerof Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  Infact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply_couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon thetroubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses tounbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbeliefthat resulted from frustration with God.The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked throughmost of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, thesewould cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith tocontinue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I domean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing betweenme an atheism from time to time) would fail.The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties andthe struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example ofthis is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, norhave I ever been, "on fire for Chirst," and I don't think I ever want to be.Nevertheless, I am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so I don't reallyfit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxietyabout my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot ofinternal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right,but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong becauseall the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has adestructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internalstrife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, noresponsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's avery appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of God" arebehaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would gothat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and Godwasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what-you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and-you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of Christ'smore overzealous followers.  A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have avery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people toChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously hadfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian richdid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to helpthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they werethought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to theemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lostChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressedhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view.There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have timeto go into them right now.Tom Ault

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of manoccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritualworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples throughhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, "better a beggar in the landof the living than a king in the land of the dead." (Iliad, I think).The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ isan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adamor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in theirsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentilehumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next tohim.

Even if they were passedon, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perceptionand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety ofexpression of the different people's ideas of the time immediatelyafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  Inany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,but by contemplating the principles themselves.On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianitythat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that thehuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul iscreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideasdominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still doestoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the sametime lived during that darkened time when the perception of oureternal spiritual being had grown dim.>maybe at sometime in the future-  Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternalirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.

I'm not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the resultof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree ifyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one'ssuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs.I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fallinto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this areaI hope you will forgive me.Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing thatone's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one'sreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-impliedbeliefs.It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.Were I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and followwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefscorrect.  That's not arrogance.  That's unavoidable behavior.It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater thanmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change sothat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worshipthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated toworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or moreintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  Nodoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observationof one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation inour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,"I'm not very smart.  I'm poor.  I'm not good looking.  I'm just a worm inthe ground.  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, Ireally cannot help it."  Were this person truely humble, he would take adifferent approach.  "God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I knowthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,I have been so unthankful.  You've given me power to resist the devil.  Ihave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have saidnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myselfwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you've given me, I have beencompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Yourlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me tosave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet itpleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led.  Lord,please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bringglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs.  Pleasehelp me to change.": : I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because: they don't want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically: don't have anything to do with them.For me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, themost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the mostproud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to bemost comfortable company.When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel likebeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally withmy wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe forall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.At the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go aboutliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront mesilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me inhumility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for helpin changing from the error of my ways.The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyoneregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy orsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunityto improve in one's ability to serve God.  It's easier to cast aside any hopeof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creationin our lives instead.: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,: many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and: over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination: that we can change our emotional reactions.: Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference betweenwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderousstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  Hewould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogantand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil's aim is to get usinto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children withhot irons.  The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurtingthose that the Father loves so much.-------------------------------------------------------------------------"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

Why must there be a "why" to the universe?"[remainder of message deleted]Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)The reason we can say "God just exists" and can't say "The universe just exists" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable.- Mark

Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask this gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?  What happened to "No doubt I am free to do anything"?  I think you have a serious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as "slimey" and "sleazy", you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about homosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even have their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them all of being mere "jokers"?I notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical prohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none that condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any "clear" New Testament statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?I am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not trying to "torpedo a serious issue" by using what you label "a ridiculous joke".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines for Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is "irrelevant" in a group called "soc.religion.christian".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good precedent for doing the same.>Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,>the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to>love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ->ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get>in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.I don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a side issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New Testament that "God has joined together" heterosexual couples, and that the marriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.  That was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. >Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every>corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same>old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never>even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with>the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can>manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great>emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even>taking the trouble to find out what it is.It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of "clear" NT condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation (or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.>Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.>WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to>condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN>to BEFORE you start your condemnations?

Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in>insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are>SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.> >Why, for God's sake?> [quote from John 3:17ff omitted for brevity]This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals?Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual morality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible condemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable, are you disobeying "repeated orders not to judge or condemn others"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?>For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from>evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and>rejected.

Psalm 82:6-7I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I agree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, and we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those who refer to sin as "sin" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible calls something "sin", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it sin too.As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on Christian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and "unclear" at best.  The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian practice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you have some verses which are at best "not clear" but which some people believe *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says anything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is it?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not.- Mark[Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision withbestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards asslimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality andbestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radicalapproach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding onChristians.  The argument is that there's no way in the text toseparate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  Thisdoes not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nordoes it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that theirsexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not fromLev.  --clh]

When James speaks of justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaringthe believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being "justified" or "proven" by the display of good works. Also according to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a "dead" or "useless" faith which fails to save.James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if itis teaching (2).

Or e-mail to>clitton@andy.bgsu.edu  Thanks in advance.I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most.The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn't have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.Tammy

I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried out!  When you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would "righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is really "best" for them.   You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the context of the teachings of Jesus/God.

Wingate       Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship wasaccepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premereInstitute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checkedout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in privatelibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THeytoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you willfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both werehighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one ofthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is stillbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  Hewas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they havemisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusionsdo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that hisconclusions are "spurious" is without merit.  He gave references to all hisconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used hisconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention theindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter toHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusionsbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing thatthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have showneven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement inCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If itwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city ofseven hills?Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your ownconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, thedocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't evenhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the twotails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress froman earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of thechurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,why did the RCC chose regardless?Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even thescriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the informationfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack ofscholorship in that.Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present noevidence supporting it.  --Rex

I believe that also this experience iscounterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and othereastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul toleave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book inLos Angeles airport entitled "Easy Journeys to Other Planets"which uses such techniques.The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such bodydeparture - the book "The Challanging Counterfeit", about aformer medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his lasttrance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill himwhile returning to his body at the end of the seancebecause of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturallyprotected by the Lord.There may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and thephenomena of 'tripping'.As regards the connection between body and soul, there is aninteresting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking aboutold age, the preacher writes "Then man goes to his eternal homeand mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before thesilver cord is severed." (12.5-6) My understanding of thissilver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soulin a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or anastronaut's air-line to his spaceship.When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attachesthe soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken:astral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports acase of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in hisapartment, with no apparent external cause.Barney Resson"Many shall run to and fro, & knowledge shall increase" (Daniel)

May I just call it "Traveling Fatima" since I don't knowof an exact translation of what we call it in my native language.For certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home (originatingfrom owner) to another.  This will stay with that family forone (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary andother prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Ladyof Fatima.  The move will be like a simple procession of folkspicking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing'prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has theprior notification about the move.  There will be the 'receiving'prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima imagethere.  It does not have to be that only members of the familyin that home who must pray to the image.  They may invite others(or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participateduring prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week.This image is moved from one family to the next within thebounded region of that district, until it goes back to the ownerof the image.This is probably going on around there (Philippines) right now(or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot) and everyyear, this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima.It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is morelikely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the imagethen is just moved next door.I am thinking of starting something like it in the village wheremy sister and her family lives.  Most of our friends and neighborsthere are Catholics and practicing ones.I'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this practice will violate, whatsoever, before I go for it.

In Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was onecongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now ineach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, theyformed something of a stew, with different members having differentheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groupsin places such as the temple courts.Now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is acommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latinwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it wouldmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the commonlanguage and not necessarily Latin.Naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the commonlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many peoplein the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate themessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don'tsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-calledPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --bi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -sometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meettogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speakEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in theirnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?Now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in theirnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of timesduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someonewho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who alsospeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for thosemeetings.As for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touchwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deepfriendships among their church relationships with people of many variousnationalities.  >Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead ofLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the secondclipping of your article.However, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on aculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.I'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.>Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as>one of them that we might reach them.

However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy churchunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.>This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are goingabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African MethodistEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused suchgroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it'shard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only onebody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working tomake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,would be taking the word "African" out of your denomination's name.  Thenperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "MethodistEpiscopal" part also, and simply be part of "the Church".>With regard to inclusivity, I note tht your .sig emits from MIT.

My question is whether thatstatement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamedsince I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and seewhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hatethe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner beginsto hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of theirbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainlycannot be a good way to build love.In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christianssupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only oneway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. Weneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way tolove someone is to pray for them. - Scott-- This is my signature.

With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaborationis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issueof the Copt-Net Newsletter :Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposedto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria playedleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speakabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of theEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was saidthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all theirtime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politicsstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the EmperorMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interferencewas clear: "You have nothing to do with the Church."  These political motivesbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  wasunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  inmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has onlyone nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it wasportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meantbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  Hisdivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and Hishumanity were united in one nature called "the nature of the incarnate word",which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in twonatures "human" and   "divine"  that are   united in   one "without mingling,without confusion, and without alteration" (from the  declaration of faith atthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures "did not separatefor a moment or the twinkling of an eye" (also from  the declaration of faithat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  ofChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  theywanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained verystrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from theWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusalto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go theextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the CopticChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile "semantic" differences betweenall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117thsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  "To the  Coptic Church, faith ismore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  andterminology are of  little importance to us."  Throughout this  century,  theCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. TheCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  AsAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites wereactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabilexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been consideredheretical probably aren't.Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians andAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptableto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agreethat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the courseof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people gotrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that wasnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to havejointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There aregroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  Thisposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are alsoa remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-calledmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-calledNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius fromwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt hisheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives ofthe Antiochene tradition.--clh]

Accordingto Luke 3:23   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about    thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,   the son of Eli,Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possibleinterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the sonof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the manto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping atstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had nointention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would havenamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David'sson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born   Jesus, who is called Christ. There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile thetwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Josephrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph wasnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quitecorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based ontruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was notinvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a HolySpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is alsocapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in thiswork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its losssolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter ofpurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is thatneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (theyhad not "known"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication ofhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevantto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, moreproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely differentsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty yearslater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered hisexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then convergewith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive hisresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other externaldocuments, and the discussion of "how this could be" might bring us beyondthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, thedetails are described in Steiner's "The Spiritual Guidance of the Human Being and of Humanity", "The Gospel of St. Luke", and "The Gospel of St.Matthew". Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are acceptedas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparentcontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this wasnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary'sJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternalline of descent from David, the king.Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

Theyexhibit every bit as much "poetic and religious feeling" as Psalms orProverbs.[deletions]: How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the: holy city" (Rev 22.18-9): Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,not to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted verylate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primaryrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude.

The booksof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible ofthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.The Torah (Pentateuch/ "Law") was established in Jesus' day, as werethe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,were still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to thePsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were allpart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.To argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51is weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronologicalstory.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in thepresent order) did not exist as such in Jesus' day.revdak@netcom.com

For somereason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean theresurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly meanthe raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell rightnow.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the"great judgement" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with thechurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my "soul"(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  Myphysical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess mynew body will have to be radically different in order to be immortalso it can be tortured for all eternity?3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physicalplace to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth?Do you think we could find it if we dig?Mark Schnitziusschnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.eduUniv. of Central Florida[There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  Ithink the most common view is that final disposition does not occuruntil a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In themeantime, some believe that people "sleep" until the finalresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from deathto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believethat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in adifferent "technology" than the current one, one which is not mortal.(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was notsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed thatthere are enough similarities that people will recognize each other,but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don'tthink I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be someanalog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under theearth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension,outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have littlein the way of details.--clh]

The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was theresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man wasblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.

Is it AIDS ?>I don't know.Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the markabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the centralmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* ofour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance forour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  Hehas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spittingon the sacrifice that Jesus made.In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset whenI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears andphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and othersocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease throughtheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I thinkit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesushealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not onthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gainingweight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health isexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributesher improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Whoare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  Itseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I(or something like that).May we all experience and accept God's grace.>>------------------------------------------------------------------------->Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.>-------------------------------------------------------------------------===============================================================================Paul CondittInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.eduApplied ResearchPhone:  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259  LaboratoriesFedex:  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423University of TexasPostal:  P.O.

The problem was not the resurrectionwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem wasthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When thestate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also sinceChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as isseen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud theissues with the resurrection.randy[I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specificallybecause they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that didcause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus.Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives otherthan a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christiansscholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --in effect, a delusion.  --clh]

The dear old aunt (now deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especiallydevout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps inAustria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with herabout politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to inviteme over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what toexpect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got,however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussionwas to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilizationof minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, onthe ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy,"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion."The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of"overpopulation," rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwedmothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, thisis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesusand admonish me against converting to Judaism, "because it involvestoo much study and effort."  And I did not even raise the prospect, nortry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly noJewish proselytism going on there.And again, last November I toured a "traditional" Jewish synagogue and wassubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity ingeneral.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that thebest supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience,the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism. -- boundaryno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina)

As you might expect, there is a rangeof answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is neverjustified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused,or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditionsthat I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation wherethey are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situationsthat have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for isto choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legalquestion turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  That's becauseof Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par.  As with so many otherthings, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  ConservativeProtestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions.More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations wherea literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is notedthat at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almoston a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach isthat Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, notto establish an absolute rule to which there could never beexceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take atheoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice throughthe process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of ournon-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance thatin some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was afeeling that the church should often be doing a better job ofhelping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems thatcome up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorceshould not be necessary.  --clh]

Facts are facts and do not goaway because I want them to be otherwise.     In another sense, every statement is subject to privateinterpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains andexpereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficientlywell attested to merit my assent.

Andrew Byler)>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of>the Acts of the Apostles can be found?1] A english translation of this can be found in:   "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson   (London, 1923).2] Another work that might be useful is:   "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and   Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;   reprinted 1970).(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that thetext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if itactually contains an english translation or not.)3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:   "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in   Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from theearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So ifyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recensionan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:   "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible   Society, 1971).Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition ofthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that wentbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included inthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings areincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:   "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the   evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the>differences are between the long and the short forms.6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including theones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer isusually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the CodexBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas thetext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelationsin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The maindifference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, ifyou prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seemsto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specificcases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is themore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anythingapproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text representspurely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to beexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in theAlexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.N

People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even whenI was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am justtalking through somebody else?" (paraphrased).With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think thatwe would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are 'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God?That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking  they are evil?Well, is faith in God evil?Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil? Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His  generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to  Him for salvation?Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are  in Christ?What brings us these:    fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?        which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?    fears of being humbled?    fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)?Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the  sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us  by martyrs and saints?We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's  opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,  instead of having communion in one body with Christ.What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages?Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster?What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love  to others who are not?Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope  and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His   acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)   everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these  are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:  "We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that  with prayers __even wars can be prevented__."but then she continues:  "You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you  have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__."Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:  "prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life  as what the Gospel brings."?Why not do so?  How?  To the world?To this, the Mother says:  "Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word."Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?Our Holy Mother says:  "The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or   anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord."Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:  "You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you."but she follows this with:  "You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how  you have lived this day."Why does she constantly conveys:  "Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself  in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray" or one time when we   decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc.The Holy Mother warns:  "Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from  my peace plan and prayer."  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep  God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and  our motherly protector from the anti-Christ?The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils  that the serpent brings upon us? This obedient and blessed new Eve?The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan?Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever  this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her  in good purpose?Why do we choose to be blind?Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's  ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother?The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient  harm and example done by the ancient Eve.She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart.The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the   righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride.Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the  second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear  the Son of God in her womb?Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary  faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock  (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more   righteous members for her Son's coming.Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy  of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,  approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and  divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the  Scripture.  Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:  "If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear  God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you." She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions, but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son andacknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the lifethat God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or whenit will be late.                                                      Nowadays, Mary says, "Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children."Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace toothers.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son."                                                                       And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She'sour good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough toshare God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.-----Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from "Latest News of Medjugorje"       Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

Have you ever asked aphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind personcannot.I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see,but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?)I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well isnot healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, andtaste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.That is God.Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth ora lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must forceourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves usenough to share it with us, even when it defies what we thinkwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world?I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  WhenI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I seethe results in the long term, I find that He has led mein the proper direction, even though it did not feel rightat the time.  This is where our works as Christians areimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,excercises of faith make the faith strong.  As for you, no one can "convert" you.  You mustchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever tofollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share withyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,we have to accept your decision, although we always keepthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find outwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you trypraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christiansabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow tounderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of thelogic of this world.May the Lord bring peace to you, Malcusco

I don't know if this isbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I donot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if>we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since>we can only use faith, why is one picture of "God" (e.g. Hinduism) any less>valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?>Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.-- ==============================================================================Mark Baker                  | "The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts." -- C.

I also recall that Cecil Andrus, whowas Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, respondedto Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gaveto man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are thetrue conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to*conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relateto one another and to God.IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker in federal prison.Bobrgolder@hoh.mbl.eduJust another Baptist...

If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what...Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father "to let this cuppass from Him", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look atJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had thepresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew everydetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  Butas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, Hispresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, itwas brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal ofJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to noavail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, notonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority ofJesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physicalportion was only the tip of the iceburg.BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthlyking.  From John:JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they            began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the            world."JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming anearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of thosewho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus'sdismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knewwhat His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in thedarkness of His Passion.-- John G. Ata - Technical Consultant | Internet:  ata@hfsi.comHFS, Inc.

All information or pointers are > appreciated.> Well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a "bastard", I canprobably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any "stigma"associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock restssolely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression forwhich they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitationson him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for theparents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDStheology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and thesubsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book ofMormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some casesholds parents responsible for their children's sins if they havefailed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that thispassage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).Also note that there is no "big genealogical book in Salt Lake City".The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountainscontaining (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. Imay be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2billion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church isbuilding up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is theresome kind of "worthiness screening" as to whether someone can beentered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who theparents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database...bruce..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bruce F.

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is oftenexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements incontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments andimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique oflanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt'sthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessaryframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal featuresremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of beingtranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, givingus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's ownaccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason thatany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language totalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall buta threshold.  vonWrights's comment that Witt's "sentences have a content that often liesdeep beneath the surface of language."  On the surface, Witt talks of theinsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringingourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced withWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changesin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through moreperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that itis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable tooffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In hisTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasseof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on aboutour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple init conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth ofunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of "as a man thinketh, sohe is."  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicalsof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding thatthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they tooare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to theindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism toChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is theone who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of theSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and hasthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who notonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep thingsof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deepthings of GOd that are absolute and true.   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experiencedand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion becauseif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  "I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He wouldsay unto me."  Job 23ff--Rexsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  "He is there and He is not Silent" by Francis Schaeffer.

In myencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by theirbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word ofGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stancemakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my ownhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.Their way is the 'truth.'But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believea particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,but it seems to me a choice.My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyarddiscussions when I was in grade school:A kid would say, "All policemen are jerks!"  I'd ask, "How doyou know?"  "Because my daddy told me so!"  "How do you knowyou're daddy is right?"  "He says he's always right!"Well the argument usually stops right there.

Ican understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enoughevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence forother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty ofintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But thatdoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people whobelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradictit are false.This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different thanthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, wherepeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independentspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is insome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications ofone sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  ButChristianity is in its essense a "historical" religion.  That is, it'sbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities outthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the "mundane" world,we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, itfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  TheChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actualexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that wehave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we knoweverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And thatimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don'tsee how else we could proceed.This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talkingwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, andeven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it'sgot to be possible to respect people and also think that on somematters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.--clh]

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable riches of knowing Christ.As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death, she said to me, "As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew." What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls.:-)) I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it and do not want to ask for it back.And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, being rooted in the past. This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. Jayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.First of all, "ceremonial law" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimesused as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions,without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.Paul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that wereagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in whatwhat food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,or the keeping of the sabbath.The word for sabbath in this verse is "sabbaton" and is used throughout theNew Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture fromwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and thesabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption "the sabbath cannotbe a ceremonial law" then he will have to find some way around it, likesaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the7tH day, Because "the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law."  ButPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sinin his writings.Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, whichtalks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would havebeen a big problem for first century Christians living in a societythat did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst wereslaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbathif it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?Link Hudson.

Christianity is the main stream inwestern culture. You are trivializing the experiences of others.I remember what it was like being "different" as a Christian. Wewere told all the time that we were different, and in fact thatonly members of the our church were really Christians (though otherswho believed in God weren't as bad as atheists), so we were a smallminority. That was nothing compared to being an atheist.The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christianbeing surrounded by staunch atheists, including parents, whoactively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishmentsand, even worse, emotional blackmail. They would also haveto have the whole mainstream society on their side. Maybe theseconditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in acountry with "under God" in its pledge of allegiance.* I doubt it even then, because children have to be taught to beChristians and hence must have support somewhere.>>I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and>>having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves>>because I've been there.

For an intellectually honestperson belief is mostly a response to evidence. Will or wishes havenothing to do with it. I could choose to lie, or to be silent aboutmy true beliefs. I could no more choose to believe in the God ofChristianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red tome. Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went throughwith what gays go through. However it is a mistake to assume thateveryone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them.Happily some are made stronger, once we get past it.>> I must say that I>>wasn't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends>>who didn't become atheists. I was just hurt differently.>>i'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain?Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of mychildhood friends. Suffice it say to that religion does not guaranteethat a person will be happy and strong emotionally, and a repressiveupbringing can leave its scars even, or especially, on those who don'tget free of it. I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that andI feel no need to defend it.By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet.

Religious Studies Dept, Saint Mary's University, Halifax, N.S.>Armstrong@husky1.stmarys.ca | att!clyde!watmath!water!dalcs!armstrngI apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and Iwould like to respond to both.As for the "goal we can never achieve", the reward comes from thetrying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining forthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out thecommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.As it says in 1 John 5:3:  "This is love for God:  to obey his comands."That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, thisrequires work on our part.As for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  Whatmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith inwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying tooneself about believing in the first place.  Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience byobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at howmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and whendoing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, weshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feelJesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states toTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  "Preach the Word; be prepared in season andout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience andcareful instruction."  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1Timothy 4:16:  "Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere inthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we arecorrect first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to behypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to bea disciple completely in both thought and deed.  Joe Fisher

Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.Moreover, there are precedents in scripture whereknowledge of sacred things is withheld:1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to "tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of "paradise" when he "heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"(2 Cor. 12:4).This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).3. There is an incident recorded in the Book ofMormon where words uttered by "babes" were "forbidden that there should not any man writethem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text followsfor those of you without access to the BOM).3 Nephi 26:16Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and theyboth saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelousthings; and the things which they did utter wereforbidden that there should not any man write them.Some LDS scholars speculate that these wordswhich could not be written are the sacredportions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).>I>can understand why Mormons would limit temple access to only faithful>Mormons, but I have never understood the emphasis on shrouding temple>ritual in mystery.

Bailey     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaningof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who activelyengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those whoengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothingof "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due topsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexualpractice as evidence of perversion" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term'sreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of theterm as "homosexuals."  Bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics insource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation"sodomites" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Baileyclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.J. Boswell     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors isthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term givesit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passivesense.      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguisticevidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "malesexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes."  His argument is that the arseno-part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers tobase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a malesexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that mostinterpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, maketheir bed with, men."  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and thehistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, suchas paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subjectnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point isthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  Moredirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ itobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greekarsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passivewould be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), Boswell affirms.  He claims thatarsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to Paul for a maleprostitute," since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos ("fornicator") andporneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the LXX, had beenadopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committedfornication."*7     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,Aristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation thatarsenokoitai "did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time ofPaul" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, SextusEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussionsof homosexual relation" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, includingthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for hisomission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11      Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim fromdiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited areTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses"circumlocutions."  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and MinuciusFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By thesixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexualactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife(353).     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes,    There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and everyreason   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to maleprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably notdisapprove of "gay inclination,"  "gay relationships,"  "enduring love betweenpersons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism"  (112, 166-17).________________________________________________________4.  D.S. Bailey,  Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. (London:1975) 38.5.  J.  Boswell, Christianity,  Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (Chicago:1980).6.  Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are:  KJV, "them that defile themselveswith mankind";  ASV,  "Abusers of themselves with men";  NASB,  "homosexuals";RSV, NKJV, NRSV, "sodomites";  NEB, NIV, "perverts"; GNB, "sexual perverts"; InI COr 6:9 these occur:  KJV, "abusers of themselves with mankind"; ASV,"Abusers of themselves with men";  NASB, RSV, "homosexuals"; NKJV, "sodomites"; NEB, "homosexual persversion."  The RSV and NEB derive their translation fromtwo Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as "homosexualperverts."  NRSV has the two words as "male prostitutes" in the text, and"sodomites" in the footnote.  The active idea predominates among thecommentators as well;  it is the primary assumption.7.  Boswell, Christianity 344.  Yet this was no a word "available to Paul for amale prostitute," for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul(as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms).  If Paulcoined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussion aboutits lack of usage in contemporary non-Christian and Christian literature ismeaningless.8.  Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word.9.  The key phrase here apparently is "discussoin," for Boswell admits later(350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in thecontext.

Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and ourstudy, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351)that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary onI Cor.

D.S. Bailey,  Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. (London:1975) 38. 6.  J.  Boswell, Christianity,  Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (Chicago:1980).   Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are:  KJV, "them that defile themselveswith mankind";  ASV,  "Abusers of themselves with men";  NASB,  "homosexuals";RSV, NKJV, NRSV, "sodomites";  NEB, NIV, "perverts"; GNB, "sexual perverts"; InI COr 6:9 these occur:  KJV, "abusers of themselves with mankind"; ASV,"Abusers of themselves with men";  NASB, RSV, "homosexuals"; NKJV, "sodomites"; NEB, "homosexual persversion."  The RSV and NEB derive their translation fromtwo Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as "homosexualperverts."  NRSV has the two words as "male prostitutes" in the text, and"sodomites" in the footnote.  The active idea predominates among thecommentators as well;  it is the primary assumption. 7.  Boswell, Christianity 344.  Yet this was no a word "available to Paul fora male prostitute," for it does not occur at all in any literature prior toPaul (as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms).  IfPaul coined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussionabout its lack of usage in contemporary non-Christian and Christian literatureis meaningless. 8.  Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word. 9.  The key phrase here apparently is "discussoin," for Boswell admits later(350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in thecontext.  Hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer(Polycarp "To the Philippian 5:3"; Theophilus "Ad Autolycum 1.2, 2.14";Nilus"Epistularum libri quattuor 2.282";  Cyril of Alexandria "Homiliae diversae14"; "Sybilline Oravle 2.13") meant.

It ispossible that the story they know is not that found in the HebrewBible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has thesame problem with direct quotes.)Again, Matthew 1:5 ("Boaz begat Obed of Ruth") tells us that Matthewknew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boazand  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned inthe OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew wasfamiliar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth importantenough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered hisOT source inspired or inerrant or canonical. But neither do directquotes. Yours, James Kiefer

My daughter's Christian school sendshome a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sentsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of anational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently madeto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who isworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The articleincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made inpreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to thespecifications given in the Bible. What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple arecomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeligovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is thevery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple isunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought thatthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuildingimpossible without sparking a holy war. Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resumingsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I thinkit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let ithappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption isdrawing near.

If the Lord has given you something to say, say it.But, before I declare "thus sayeth the Lord", I'd better know for certainwithout a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual conditionand relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutelycertain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is nopossibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gainingrecognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fearsin this area would be the following:1--that the people would be misled2--that people would lose respect for christianity3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,   my calling would be lost forever.  God's Word would command the people   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My   bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but   I could never again be a prophet of God.In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speakand that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive theworld of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate,cowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, itis critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, andin prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judgingone another, claiming "rights" that are not theirs, denying rights that doindeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the "gods" of thisworld, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feelgood.It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out incontrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, "thus sayeth theLord", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right.When we say we're christians, we really mean it.

We, as a nation, have behaved incrediblyarrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks toparticipate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  Wehave arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowedus the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for othernations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We havestricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of thehonor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as publicas our sins have been.When Jesus said "Judge not that ye be not judged", he was not addressingthose like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others torepent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping downcondemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to removethe log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  ButHe also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a commandtoo.Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we wererebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with theexcuse that we don't want to judge anyone.In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent moreand to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sinwhat it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of theirhellward path and onto the heavenward path.-------------------------------------------------------------------------"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

Your observation would probably be valid if we werediscussing the "mind" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal,as it were; and half spiritual. ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity theinfallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects. ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they?cannot be certain.This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or aconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds meof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain ofa measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are tryingto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although themeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able todetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and thisknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enoughto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, ourcompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in ourability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areasnot subject to the experimental method. ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu?"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some?

And such were >some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11.The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds ofactivity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or"reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We mayor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the veryfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not atall "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interestin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominatedChristian discussion of ALL these areas.Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians Iknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- andchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly"harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapteryou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter thatyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everythingis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for onewill not let anything make free with me."  [1 Cor. 6:12]Which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God.  Acommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Somepeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondaryargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with suchbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in yourassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty oflaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most ofwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examinethem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" andwhich ones are "ritual."  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropologycourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categoriesin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticusfrom the "ritual law" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in thismatter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and whatdo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort ofarbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eatinginsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can yousay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a partof the ritual law?For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus canbe "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* todetermine why you "pick" one and ignore another.  I frankly think thewhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: "No doubt I am free to do anything."But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot gothrough Leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, thenyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In thiscontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as theone that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously(though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality.  It isabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual humanadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevantthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, youare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of theworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, notmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is inour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearingus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest meansyou can think of to do so.Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required tolove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we getin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in everycorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these sameold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe nevereven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us withthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds canmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) greatemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without eventaking the trouble to find out what it is.Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses tocondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTENto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge orcondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time ininsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you areSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.Why, for God's sake?"For God did not send the Son into the worldto condemn the world,but that the world might be saved through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned,but whoever does not believe has already been condemnedfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.Now the judgment is this:the light has come into the world,but men have preferred darkness to lightbecause their deeds were evil.For everyone who practices wickednesshates the light,and does not come near the lightfor fear his deeds will be exposed.But he who acts in truthcomes into the light,so that it may be sh0ownthat his deeds are done in God."John 3:17-21For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel fromevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed andrejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spiritshave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies whofear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadowit with the darkness of false witness against us.-- Michael L.

Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leavethe unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence',thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must besecondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modesof interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.-- sarima@teradata.com(formerly tdatirv!sarima)  orStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com[I think one can read Augustine as saying something consistent withyour comments.

Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be inthe "fiery lake of burning sulfur".Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast"will be tormented with burning sulfur" and there being "no rest day ornight" for them because of it.Psalm 9:17:  "The wicked return to the grave, all the nations thatforget God."I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.>DariusJoe Fisher[In the following I'm mostly playing "devil's advocate".  I'm notadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand thatit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possibleto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev oftenuses the term "second death".  The most obvious understanding of thatwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaksboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses termsthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convinceyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand thatthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible tounderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primarypoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumablythey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to understand this passage in a non-literal way.)2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding themin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fireprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire iseternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having beenprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about theeternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophetwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people beingthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as "the second death".This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possiblethat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such asthe devil, and humans?2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is "everlasting destruction"?This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly beunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to thinkthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destructionthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs ineternity.2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.Revelation 21:6-8: see comment aboveRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It saysthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the peopleare tormented forever.Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.--clh]

Your faith in Jesus or His skin color (as a human) ?In the interest of historical accuracy, however, since Jesuswas from Israel wouldn't His skin color be like any other Jew ?i.e. fair-skinned ? Although probably heavily tanned from thedesert sun ?

Whilethere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is noinjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  Butsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would ratherkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participantsexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with theceremony itself.| Granted, the Gnostic "Christians"| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics waswritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secretinformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and thatthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests andbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  Heclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with theapostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups whichwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasizesecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teachingcertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens adialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is "You seemto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell youboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is notpermitted to me now to disclose these things to you" (_ClementineRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, butcan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  Idon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but Ibelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) ofearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.| Neither New Testament| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expectto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book ofMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information ontemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship intemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize thatworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*practices which might have taken place, and that absence of suchdescriptions proves they did not exist?Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures fromwhich I have taken a few:1. "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom ofheaven, but to them it is not given" (Matt. 13:11).2. "All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"(Matt. 19:11).3. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear themnow" (John 16:12).4. "The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,but I shall shew you plainly of the Father" (John 16:25).5. "... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"(1 Cor. 3:1-2).6. "Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...come unto you and speak face to face" (2 Jn. 1:12).(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believethey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taughtwere actually taught openly.| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative| information on whether or not this claim is true?Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the templeendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did notchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith hadample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of histime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specificconnection has yet been established.My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple ritetranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believethat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  Asour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in therecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics whocharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not haveadequate knowledge of the rites in question.-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu------------------------------------------------------------------------

We had a discussion about the difference between Christianityand Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teachersaid that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, "What??"I did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who areso kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them(in my point of view, they don't sin as much as I do). How come if theywere under Satan, they could have such personalities. To tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam.But I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day ofjudgement.Now I'm  asking you what your opinions about Islam and its teaching. IMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.P.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,     and bit.listserv.catholic.In Christ, our Lord,                           Smile.........       Jesus loves you.......Tabut TorsinaTORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU   [Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for adiscussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspectthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.Indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting atwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christiansare saved is at the heart of it.The classic Christian view, which I think most people believed untilthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)was the only religion founded by God, and that all other religionsworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less acorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (andpossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's notruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members areintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they mightcontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They wouldbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.If this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspectit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarilyrelevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrongwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitionersmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being afollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.Christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind andnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But noone is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's aCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but indifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visibleways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consistsof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing someessential food element so that you end up dying.Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.What I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it isnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all otherreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as anunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general movewithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgementalGod.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allowanybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and theyfind it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are atwork in the world doing things like creating superficially attractivealternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basisfor the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.--clh]

All children are born pure, i.e., without sin.However, most saints would view a pregnancyoutside of marriage as an occasion of mourning.(Some church members would be much morejudgmental, but that is *their* problem.)In situations where welfare assistance is provided through our Church, bishops usuallyrequire that the family be making some effort tolive the Gospel standards and provide for themselves.However, there are occasions when assistance isprovided because of the children in the home.As a former bishop of mine said, "Children are always worthy before God.">I'm especially >keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on >bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical >book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City.  I am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards"in this context.Latter-Day Saints believe that through thetemple ordinances the family unit may bepreserved in eternity.If you use genealogical material or softwareproduced by the Church, you may notice a sectionfor "temple ordinances."  Within that sectionthere should be a spot for signifying "BIC"which stands for "born in the covenant."The children born to couple sealed (married)within the temple are "born in the covenant"and are eligible to be part of that eternalfamily unit.Children born to other couples (whether in acivil marriage or not) would have to besealed to their parents after their marriageis solemnized for eternity.Supposing a child were born to a woman out ofwedlock, he or she could be sealed to his orher parents at a later date or adopted into any eternal family unit (which may include oneof the birth parents).>If this is an issue on which the >"official" position has changed over time, I'm interested in learning both old >and new beliefs.

By coincidence, last week's_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT translation in the New American Bible.  He noted "...certain practices have been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy."  I note that at my parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen".

In that postingI made sure I used the word "public".  Public revelation containsGod's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation containedin the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Privaterevelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speakdirectly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send theVirgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required tobelieve a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,but doctrines can not.When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, theChurch may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihoodthat the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will beapproved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came fromGod.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the mostwell attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as thoseat Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do rejectFatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does notmean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses inevaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I needevery day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is thatnothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anythingknown through public revelation-------Marty HelgesenBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu"What if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation?"

But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.[ . . . ]Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as theCatholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of countingtheir rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  Thereis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accountswithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one reallybeautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by threedeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chantsin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passionthat John would prefer.But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracyagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initialblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is alreadygetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that theyshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, theorchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participationin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might benecessary to go with the briefer options just to "get 'em in and get 'emout".Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied totheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parishin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgycloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellowparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastorsgenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Thoughyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too stronglyto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't followthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, nosingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuatedequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-rememberingthe names of the evolutionary theories.}--                                                     --- Tim Rolfe                                                 rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu                                                 rolfe@junior.dsu.edu                                                RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find acontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city ofSodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says: + Suppose that there are some good men in the city. + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, andcan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!There are those who say that the definition of "good" is "whateverGod happens to want." But if that is so, then the statement that Godis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because Heis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He ispowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when hetells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if youdefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makessense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if youdon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction toGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes anyfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgementsare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgementsin particular cases about the course of action most likely toachieve a good result.When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God inhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what Imight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the naturalworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I mightexpect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said:"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author ofthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sortof difficulties that they find in Nature.")Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself anargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Supposethat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that everytime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: "Good move!Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made ifI were playing." That would be a sign that Fisher is no better achess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that atleast some of his moves will have me thinking, "Now, what do supposeinduced him to do that?" or even, "Boy, that was a real slip -- he'sjust thrown the game away!" Similarly, if God understands theworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected thatsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at thecontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chessgame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it wascarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was atime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and didnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I hadthought.With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the totalresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judgingthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakierthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sellhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, andwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for hisfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: "Donot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good."I once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews   and of Judaism.        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into   the Promised Land.        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge   of all humans everywhere.        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism   saved them.        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking   at Walt Disney, she said, "And now, my special thanks to the   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!" It was the most   memorable line of the evening.        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus   Epiphanes....After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to himprivately and said, "You were talking about the Holocaust, weren'tyou?" He answered, "If that is an example that came to your mind,then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would nottalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it." I assumethat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been nostate of Israel.Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusionthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish Hispurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  goon to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that Hestirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, andthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh'sheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.And this raises questions about how an action can be consideredwicked and at the same time be considered something that God hasbrought about.I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who hasa log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knotthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considersthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features theknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and colorof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so thatobservers will say: "How fortunate the sculptor was in finding apiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Itspresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue agreat work of art." In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor waslooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had notcontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, Godwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had notbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejectedJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, ifPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had setJesus free, it might appear that there would have been noCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore noSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. IfJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciledthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not knowhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if itsinterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, andjust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourthgame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishopsand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look upthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point isnone the less valid).Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice ofPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardicewas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God'splans by behaving justly and courageously.What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, "Iwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go"?Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppetwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and crueltywere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose ratherthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: "If you seethat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not bediscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. Mypurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you andlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit hisresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that futurehistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have beenthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me."To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possiblethat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, areinstruments of God's will?     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as whatJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, thatdoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation andpunishment.     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But notthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians hadrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does thegood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.

Blessed art thou among women."and Luke 1:48? ...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary waspossessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of us are, but it seems to me that "full of grace" means just what it says:   filled to the brim, incapable of containing more.  The only other people we know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now (another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in an earlier post).  Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary  was sinless.  As a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace.  Butthat's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play.  I pray Godto strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ,which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church.  And,as you probably know, faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith inChrist inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body.  A Catholic bynature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in Christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church as the body of Christ. -- Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Catechistgt7122b@prism.gatech.edu [You might want to check the Greek.

Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not.Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find thetranslation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ,which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, inunion with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism,which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising withChrist by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has theadvantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom theirbaptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized inthe cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not addto their baptism faith and obedience.Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on thebasis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise ofGod. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be apunishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.>>Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.

Shall youmake ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?  >>Ezekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,>and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?>For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.>Repent and live!">>The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.

There is not otherhyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse andchildbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). Thewhole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burntoffering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as hedid not ritually cleanse himself when he should have. But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to becut. That's why brith was unclean.

In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I'llalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined theterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that wouldmean for Paul's readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorterthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts uswith some of the major divisions within Christ's body, and I am not tryingto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms thatseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (looselycharacterizable as "liberal") will be evident, but I am not grinding anaxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARDto reach "closure" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what weeach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.So; stipulating Paul's intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HISREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there isa second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1stCorinthians, there are two "positive" answers and one "negative" to thisquestion:+a.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]+b.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,    what God means "behind" Paul's inspired word-choice.)-c.  We *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ ("those who have    more" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is "obvious" from    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB    translates it as "grabbers") or even _methusoi_ ("drunkards"    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggerationfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towardstradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/criticaldemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses._ad_ a:It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by thecommunity of Christ's disciples and their successors, and thatour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.But it's also the case that we know little or nothing about thistradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say thatwe have access to the tradition only after several generations ofpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our onlydocumentation of the tradition in the critical era._ad_ b:If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in anattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-standing the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions ofmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spiritfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  Butthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spiritas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism thattakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergentunderstanding supposedly derived from the "clear" Word of God.[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thoughtconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, evenwhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;the more bizarre forms of "I will read Scripture my way"are primarily a fringe aspect of "cultic" Protestantism.]The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently nomeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredibleconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind"convinced" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriouslyurge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christianagainst Christian.  To what purpose?_ad_ c:The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it canreach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is opento all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usuallypossible. :-)[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;one complaint against critical methodology is that it "dissolves"faith -- but surely a "faith" that cannot honestly face the evalu-ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless toaddress.]Anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between"liberal" and "conservative" positions, mostly on the basis of extremezealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and traditiontends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so thatdespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues asultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (Ipredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each positionits due, but no more than its due. Second question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of "spiritual"Christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,that Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition againstmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it's preciselywhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous.We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use oftradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).We have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning thetraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesusand Peter and Paul do not so much "throw out" tradition as subject it toradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:     "the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith"(Matthew 23:23)and  "On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,      and the Prophets, also."(Matthew 22:40)If there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in thechallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generationto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reportedwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imaginationto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challengesagainst are in fact open to challenge.All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God maylead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritualinstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, andinherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it isimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercyand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow fromlove of God and love of neighbor.I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  Thatthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I amtoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christiansappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated"sodomites" as the "cause" of the earthquake, so that legislation waspassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is inaccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is humantradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that muchdifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quickto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,then I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lordis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamalielsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up ofits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will notonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselvesfighting against God."[Acts 5:36...39] All I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptureswith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of ourfirst Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHERreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes andrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on thelove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history ofChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness tojudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness ofthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those whoare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God's truth.-- Michael L. SiemonI say "You are gods, sons of themls@panix.comMost High, all of you; nevertheless    - or -you shall die like men, and fallmls@ulysses.att..comlike any prince."   Psalm 82:6-7[There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as towhether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours.  I thinkthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul andhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his wordsin the context of that shared tradition.  That's what makes me thinkthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know thatPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent withthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the mostgeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there'ssome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece ofevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with noevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection ofhomosexuality.But when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that's rather ahorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves acontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that traditionmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's originalmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpretedhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply inour time because of the universal judgement of the church between histime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.tradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning, but not use theCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude tohomosexuality should be.--clh]

First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is thefirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles ofSatan. "[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood inthe truth because there is no truth in him." John 8.44.  Now theproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and "thewoman", and enmity between Satan and "her seed."  Now the woman is bothEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. "Her seed" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in thesame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing aswe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude thatMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmitywith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of hersinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, aswould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and theserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by theArchangle Gabriel "full of grace."  As I pointed out above this is fromthe Greek word "Kecharitomene" which means not just full of grace, but aplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped bythe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, "Hail you who have been and reaminfilled with grace."  But that is a little to long to say, so it isreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, "you who have been" Mary hadalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, whichwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have donewhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And ifGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through hisMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which theFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all ofChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope onthe matter in "Ineffibilus Deus."Andy Byler

Alower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. TheACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's actionprotected the "religious neutrality of our public schools." He alsosaid that schools must serve students of "all faiths and none."Schools were not to be a "bazaar where rival religious groupscompete for converts," according to Lynn.Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles inhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell ofsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles onsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want theirchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing tocontinue their work at a distance, but find the school's positionsomewhat disheartening.I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, Ican see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the otherhand, when does "neutrality" become "nihilism?" When does pluralityturn into no position at all?I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condomsbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.The other is that while we are seeking "religious neutrality" inour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced"religious neutrality" for the past seventy years--are making the Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government hadrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who ispresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerlyinvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to thestudents and are given class time to explain its contents. Iremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible andspeaking to the university students standing under a statue ofLenin. Now, that's ironic!I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faithshave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) Toallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-likeatmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religionsand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitalityof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the publicarena acknowledges it as valid.However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing thedistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in ourschools only signals once again our culture's movement away from asingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can makemoral and ethical decisions.What do you think?                          -= MAIL BOX =-(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or yourname.)Good column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agreewith moral education from home, but some homes don't have the kindsof morals I want taught.

We *are* commanded tolove one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroicattempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love andthe gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too*heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- andit raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much ofearly Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian)cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a seriousproblem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatoryand ironic.)But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect andlove for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under-standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and beginto withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in otherwords, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, mostespecially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christiansand Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, someof Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him.Fortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.Easter, 1993.(yes; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forwardbecause so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils,and the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do ithere and there as well.

In English,German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about theorigin of this term.One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DERATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of anAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a greatscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use ofthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been wellestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birthof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likelythat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness thatthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring shouldhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelfconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede doesnot make it more so.Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that theChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for somecenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christiansand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival everyspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "SpringFestival."However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  JKnoblech, in "Die Sprach," ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feastof the Resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week),since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear theirwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week wasreferred to simply as "albae." Translaters rendering this intoGerman mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." Theyaccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for"dawn." This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

The church is based on the Word of God only          Cornerstone=Christ          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)1 Corinthians 12:12-13   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the churchAs for the question of denominations:   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions inthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church(and in time, their writings)   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find achurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyleHebrews 10:24-25   A.  Do not miss church   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.Involved on a relationship level in the church   C.  Must come to ALL servicesAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should beencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.Of course, more standards apply:   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their livesand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,disciples).   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directlyface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't takePaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verifyhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify thepastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light ofother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would'vemade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light ofMatthew 24).Joe Fisher

That's quitedifferent from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like theusual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what hedoes. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of Lazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is thata fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choiceand isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between God and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not builton Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear wereremoved, there would BE no foundation.  That's basically why it matters to me.

First the scriptural quotations:This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified,if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.

People who wouldtry to justify their own positions.Second the logical proof:>quoted text...>>From: xx155@yfn.ysu.edu (Family Magazine Sysops)>Subject: WITNESS & PROOF OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION>Date: 11 Apr 93 05:01:19 GMT>>[much deleted]>>            4.

Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks forrational western man, myself included.I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a rejection of the resurrection's occurance.

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses fromLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to beignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).Later,Max (Bob) Muir[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonlycited passages are:the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, andthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediateposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in theBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been knownspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered acesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the actiondescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine aboutas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape ofguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specificallyabout homosexuality.In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's aboutidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or atleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over thispassage.  It does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referringto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality.The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used heremean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,such as "wanton", and that another may be specifically "maleprostitute".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching abouthomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paulshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  Thecontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped inSodom were angels, it seems likely that "strange flesh" refers tointercourse with angels.As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion isdetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note thatthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OTprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NTendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and noclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern inRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactlydo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it islegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from hisbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in longdissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it'sclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes downto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether theybelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  Thisappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as awhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the differencebetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where bothsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that theykeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and theother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes thingsvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimisticoutcome is not very likely...--clh]

If the investigation indicates a   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny whathappened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like sayingthat a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What aCatholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without beingcalled a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such anoffense, but not a heretic.Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assentone must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed byGod through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent dueto a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdesdemand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in humanhistory.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church."Approval" of an apparition by the Church principally means thatwhatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of tellingus what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all thedoctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help inknowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series ofapparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problemat the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord intosomeone without a heart.The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in theChurch (we are living it), and what to do to save the most soulspossible in such a situation.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect forothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systemswithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about mattersof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable byobjective means.  Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from thisthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosingthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for thehonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It isuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proudnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, thatleads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)>Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu>"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.">                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgensteincomments, criticism welcome...-Kenalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu[It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our ownability to know the truth.  There are also different paths in someareas of practice.  But I'd like to see more clarification about whatyou mean when you reject the idea of saying "their specific beliefsare not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding onothers."  If something is true, it is true for everyone, assuming thatthe belief is something about God, history, etc.  Of course somethingof the form "I believe that it's best for me not to xxx" could be truefor some people and not others.  I have suggested in the past that Godmay be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are.But that doesn't mean I doubt that there is a difference betweentrue and false, nor that I think there is no benefit in finding outwhat is true.  --clh]

If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him."The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,Aaron Cardenas

Smith, D.D.                              (1894-1977)          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall               rise again" (Matthew 20:18-19).          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).          How did this tomb become empty?          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the     chimney at Christmas time.          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)     that the women went to the wrong tomb.          The facts are these:          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to     which by mistake they could have gone.          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or     more people to forget the place where they have buried their     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to     the wrong tomb?          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                  Now when they were going, behold, some               of the watch came into the city and showed               unto the chief priests all the things that               were done.  And when they were assembled               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and               secure you.  So they took the money, and did               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-               monly reported among the Jews until this day               (Matthew 28:11-15).          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the     fact that the tomb was empty.          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away     the body of Jesus.          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,     then proved.          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most     of these men did.          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to     what had happened to Him.          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-     8).          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the     appearances.          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He     claimed to have come down *from* God.          He said He was the way *to* God.          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one     else had it.          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to     us.          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe     that His words are all true?          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.          Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been     many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know.

This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with noother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, itssupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infantswill go to hell.It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list ofscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have theheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblicallybased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take amore complete look at scripture.Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off ofthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having beenburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in thepower of God, who raised him from the dead."In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through apersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Doinfants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  ForIsaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faithcomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the wordof Christ."So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of thegospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kidsare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough torespond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannotbe raised in baptism to a new life.Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share theguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  Therighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and thewickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guiltyfor anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.Ezekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.Repent and live!"The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kidscannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, wewill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin isnot Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, anddeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because allsinned--"Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came toeach man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through allof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand thanothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are allsaying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.Romans 5:19 "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the manywere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the manywill be made righteous."Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  Inthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to eachman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to readthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point ofview to see if it doesn't all fit together.Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my motherconceived me."This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselvesbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God'sown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba andmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can'tremember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before Godby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth isa hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literalinterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and thatoriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism isnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys withother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feelingis always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bibleagrees with my gut feelings.Isaiah 7:14-15 "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  Thevirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call himImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject thewrong and choose the right."Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecyabout Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a newleader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal humanbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extentbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see thathe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication isthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right overwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have ratherconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choosethe right instead of the wrong.Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry assoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he wastempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).Thank you for your attention.Moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps youwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost itfrom time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange thecontents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ.Sincerely,Aaron Cardenasaaronc@athena.mit.edu[I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality ofyour response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.It was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in oneform or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism isan ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.The original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptistsstill hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infantswithout believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacramentstend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants whobaptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us,rather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestanttheology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable tochildren.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicatethat God accepts even children.  --clh]

Can the infinite die?Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course,in your termonology, God could not "cease to exist."  However, that is not whatdeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will seethat it signifies "separation."  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This isthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, onemember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my"girlfriend" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we wereseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decidedthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me wasdeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death isseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, notbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to gothere.  >> did you know that Jesus talked more>> about hell than He did about heaven!  >Thank you for this info.

He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh andunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let usdo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses toyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  >Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel>     the pinpricks man dealt him...This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correctknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable. Jesus most certainly felt the "pinpricks" of life.  As the Scripture say:Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with ourweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet withoutsin.The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributeswhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mineto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  "The Consciousness ofChrist."  I have talked at length with a great many people about thisinteresting study, including clh.  It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actuallysuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as wedo.  He "grew in knowledge."  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but choseto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was "led of the Spirit" to suchan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man andJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He wasliving sequential history as you or I.  Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussionand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often thannot.>Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I>     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I'm going to>     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro->     duction... :-)I was once a member of that club.  THe "free thinker" is a glorious ideal.  Bycontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repositoryof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I findsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanistwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his "rationaldoubt" when in fact he was led to it by his "faith".  He must acknowledge thatwhile it is rational doubt for him as a "free thinker" to criticize theChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticizehim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is nofaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.Pascal pointed out that "sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive. Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism."  The fact that skeptics are notskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we mustbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith oreven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is ameasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can definehimself only in negative terms, hence the term "a"-theist.Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  Inmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communicationspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to makesense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticismis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out "Look, your flyis undone!"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what hebelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but itunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what heknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based onpresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed beforeit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, andcritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objectiveand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there issomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these canbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons areour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken forabsence.>  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is>    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to>     serve a tyrant in Heaven..Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it hadbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first "Highlander" movie. But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character ofGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistictheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through Hisprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If youare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correctunderstanding of Himself.--Rex

I am not saying that I totally agree with his  interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the "do  it if it feels good" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  Babylon "Babylon the Great" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  most powerful nation on earth.Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  of consideration.Jeffrey Little

Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and getoffended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.(BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes theirmind.

"God" or Jesus Christ?John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day)"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that Godand Jesus are one.  Therefore, "The Lord" refers to both.  Also, David in thePsalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Onceagain this refers to God and Jesus.>5. What is the definition of a "Truly religious" person? Should he/she not    swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?Some of the most "truly religious" people I've known have not been Christiansand some of the greatest Christians I've known have been truly irreligious.However, to answer your question:The bible speaks of this in many places, A previous post to James is a goodone.  Another is Psalm 15:"Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?  Who may dwell in your holy hill?  Hewho walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heartHe who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nordoes he take up a reproach against his friend; I whose eyes a vile person isdespised, but he honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to his own hurtand does not change; He who does not put out money at usury, nor does he takea bribe aginst the innocent.

I got it froma The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of theeditor.    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga    The Patron of Youth    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in    the manner expected.    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this    life.  As  Saint  Aloysiusgrew, he began to resemble his mother    more than his father.    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering toshow  his  reciprocal    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  SaintIgna-    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)    towards which Saint Aloysius  -12-    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his    son:  "Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-    ness?" "I will not, father," was the  in-evitable  reply."Then    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!"    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  topray:    "Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!" He knelt down    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but    this  timehe was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This    at last brought the proud man to his senses. "The Lord wants him,    the Lord can have him." He gave his consent for his son to become    a Jesuit.    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare    the dying for a holy death.    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  fromcarrying  and    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soulto  the  Lord    while gazing at a crucifix.    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.    - Brendan Arthur    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of    others as a sword is to a soldierGod BlessFrom SimonLines:  106-- /----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\|  Simon P.

But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too. Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to "just offer it up" probably is the solution.A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty complicated.One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still Mass.Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org

I don't think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your questionon "asking Jesus to come into your heart" seems to imply that infantsare not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always beviewed by some people as a sort of "prodigal son" type of thing; i.e. asudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenlyaccepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortlyafter birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, doesa man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From myexperiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built,including one's relationship with God.   Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just aritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon therecipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christit is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itselfbestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoptioninto God's family on the soul.----------Steve Creps, Indiana Universitycreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

Suppose your parents committed some crime beforeyou were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you injail for it. Would you really think that is fair? I know I wouldn't.

These are folks who   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have   doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply   because it is not Biblical.  --clh]Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and onearth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of allnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son andof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that Ihave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the endof the age." {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other textscontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of theTrinity the most likely explanation after all?But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.

Christianity really is an education in itself.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------|David R. TuckerKG2S     drt@athena.mit.edu|------------------------------------------------------------------------[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarianlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, thingslike "one essense and three persons".  Obviously the three-foldbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use theterm "three-fold" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainlyconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whosefull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikelythat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that donot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulaeoccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism inthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts aswell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus."Jesus only" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider thisconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name ofthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one toask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does notappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way ofdealing with the idiomatic phrase "in the name of".)Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standardanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that "in the nameof" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the nameof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptismwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's acertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that wecould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specificthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizesbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.One might well suspect that in the early church, more than onebaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus tobe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no greatdamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean thatI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one ofthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognizemutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be inthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact thatthose groups that actually use "in the name of Jesus" now do seem tohave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'mnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.--clh]

But if you can contrive>to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, or dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign that he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit'sway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so thatwe can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holyeven when he dreams.Dreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examplesof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to becareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especiallyif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generatean out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBEmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caughtup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one reallyleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by aspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it mattersthat much.  Paul could not tell.  Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satanto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a place until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  IfGod wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of Hisown sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets arejust taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seekingan OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he wascaught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with someJewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God onetime.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spiritsfor the sake of a few thrills.Link Hudson.

And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesushimself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more thanheaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and newchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word"throne" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive theassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they arealready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is norecourse, excuse or defense.>>I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with >putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel >without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a >clanging cymbal.Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings toextremes before stopping at "moderation."  I think we have seen the extreme ofthe "hell fire & brimstone" preacher, but also we have seen the other extremewhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someonessensibilities.I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling astory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to thepoint of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believedeverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked topray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the manwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe inhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn'texist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn'texist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  Andyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul thatisn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As thesurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that whichis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richnesswhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,then broad is the way to distruction.>>Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are >afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that weshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  Iwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and itseternality.1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.   If responsible, then he is also accountable.3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to   the "whosoever will."--Rex

For if they hadhad previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of themhas done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hateEasau when Esau has done nothing bad?I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating whenwhat is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example,consider the saying in Matthew 6:24 + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one + and love the other, or....Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate oneof them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them insecond place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobbycalls will have a problem if they stand in different places and callsimultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must takesecond place.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION            1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                body because that would have perpetrated the                resurrection--the very opposite of what they                desired.            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                body because Pontius Pilate established guards                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                stolen.            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                had risen from the dead.            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He                *would indeed* rise from the dead.            5.  The probability of being able to perpetrate such                a hoax successfully upon the entire world for                nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative!                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existenceof God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reasonis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, "Traditional Proofs for the Existence of God," and Summa Theologica).Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallencondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, theMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives orderto the universe (logos).I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which iscontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savioras early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that becausea human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Sourceof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claimis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the UnitedStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellentinstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I willreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  Forexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he couldhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics mustbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.QED -- boundaryno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina)

I had great difficultywith that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthousebathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the coupleswould come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness anddivine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realizethat marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually,however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in astrictly secular, public capacity, established as such by boththe state and the expectations of the couples involved, I wasreally conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with nogreater moral or religious implications than if I had beenconducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion).      I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharpdistinction between marriage before God, and "marriage" beforethe state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  KeepingMatthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no businessdissolving my marriage established before God, but of course itassumed jurisdiction nonetheless.        I would ask those of you proposing answers to thisquestion to consider this issue's logical extension: Ifintercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or theceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishesmarriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?

It is abit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of youanyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel mightbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it. =======================================================================                    D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?  Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, "God Loves You."  Isn't   that true? A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:       For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16    However, God's love is qualified.  The Bible says:       The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9       For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6  Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How   can these verses apply to me? A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before   God.       As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11       The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9  Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me? A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.       For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24  Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not   that bad. A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal   and consists of perpetual suffering.       And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15       So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50       ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9  Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell? A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be   accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands   payment for sin.       For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23       For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10       But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                       Matthew 12:36  Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell? A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.       All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6       But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5       For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4       For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21  Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about   Hell anymore? A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.       He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36  Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to   Hell? A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins   and serve Christ as our Lord.       No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                        Matthew 6:24       Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19  Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their   followers also go to Hell? A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and   save us.       Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be      saved.                                               Acts 4:12    Jesus said:       I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6       If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                          1 John 1:9  Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do? A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.       And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13       ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                       Acts 16:30-31  Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him? A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.       For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8    God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is   the only Word of God.   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.       So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of      God.                                              Romans 10:17  Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God? A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.       The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17    Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to   Hell.       Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26  Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be   baptized?  Will these save me? A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-   ure.  Salvation is       Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9  Q. What else will happen at the end of the world? A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-   more.       For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17  Q. What will happen to the earth at that time? A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-   more.       But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13  Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will   come? A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to   save.       And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end      come.                                            Matthew 24:14  Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be? A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.       For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3       Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7  Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here. A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.       And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4  Q. What did the people of Nineveh do? A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.       But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9  Q. Did God hear their prayers? A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.  Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-   ment? A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has   become very short.       How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3       In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?

A  number  of  minorchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printingand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraphwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within thetext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; theyappear here as indented paragraphs.  I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual-ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to whatthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him thatthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteedone  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take thesematters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about oureternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even moresenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages withrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain acopy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself,you may find the following information helpful:       title:       1994?      author:      Harold Camping      publisher:   Vantage Press      distributor: Baker and Taylor      ISBN:        0-533-10368-1  I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedlyagree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  thanever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  Iam  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible withanyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of anyreal  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so littletime  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

Random Misconfigured SiteLines: 76Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.eduI am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by therational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. Inever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, anddo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy tolook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] whohad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirelyoblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [withmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in theBible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to arguethat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God'srevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, theChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestantludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptanceof Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is verywell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsettingquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today'scarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitableviews about other human beings. now the question is this: were the first Christians just asweird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine "Fall of theChurch" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have towait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church.It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Churchnot being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing,and it was the early communities that were weird. The institionalchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses tothis entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestantswith their "soul alone with Jesus" approach, but for we who see the"ecclesia" as a "koinoia" over time and space, the weird earlyChristians are a problem.[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestantshave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  "The soulalone with God" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by nomeans the whole story.I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because webelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestantmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (ormore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulatedpower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having itearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants acceptthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, includingsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works ofReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers suchas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find manyProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was"wierd".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don'tmuch want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked atrecently -- that's the question of whether one can really think ofAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their viewson Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial toProtestant thought.)One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  Whatconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  Wesee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's goodreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent thanthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason tothink that many Christians were happily married.  I can't helpsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos andsane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of"revisionism" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean thatthey're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don't you thinkthere might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?--clh]

Ifpeople who "speak in tongues" make claims that they aremiraculously speaking a foreign language through the power ofthe Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simplymaking noises, it damages all Christians, since many who arenot Christians do not distinguish between the various sects.The more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simplyuncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the onethat should be used by those who make use of this practice.I agree with the point that "Charismatic" practices like thiscan lead to forms of worship which are more about theworshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of thethings Jesus warned us about.Matthew Huntbach

(David Hammerslag)How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit.Tobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called "The Apocrypha". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews of Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around theson of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias washer only relative and "...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning"(6:17).Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not eliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting story to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter than Esther.The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16."Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long ashe is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriageare not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world."Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, whichangels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory."

What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: "All war  is wrong", or "Some war is justifiable". To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite  computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  past and present. I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's  bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These  euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.1. The Second World War- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.- Massive civilian casualties on both sides - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki- Probably justifiable.2. Korean war- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically  communism vs. capitalism.- Probably not justifiable.3. Vietnam- As above, worsened by US involvement.4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.- Probably justifiable.5. Iraq (Desert Storm)- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply- Other factors such as genocide.- Not sure, but probably justifiable6. A future involvement in Bosnia- Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.- Probably justifiable7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  or Israel.- My feelings in this are simple- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent- I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear  armed or powered warships from NZ port.- Never justifiable.These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I  *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).Thanks for your help.==========================================================================                                    |Alastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347Chief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529The Black Albatross Porject,        |University of Otago,                |Department of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nzP.O.

Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't knowthat they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examiningof Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent andchange.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinfulpossibilities is:  "Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point intime?"

First of all I would say that I'm not sure allthe prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not meanit will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostleswho quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divinemessengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one hasthat authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say thatsuch-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry ofRevelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to tryand make it apply to events 20 centuries later.--Tom Albrecht

This will probablyinvolve defining "spritual needs" (is it not that clear) andshowing that such things exist and how they can be filled.Annother tack you might take is to say that "fulfilling spiritualneeds" means "acknowledging a "higher power" of some sort, thenshow that systems that do require this, work better than otherwiseidentical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you,but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swappingone crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion isusually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usuallypoisonous! :) )I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable.

If one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call these "emotional needs". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only besatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people whoaccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since Ibelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the othersare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--iewe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are deluded--they just haven't recognized it yet.2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brainchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do nothave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritualneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existenceof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjectiveevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything thatI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence anddemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertionis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before, I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the fence by subjective evidence.

Just in looking at two of the four references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the _Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for such 'interpretations.'And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to the Temple Ceremonies. The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: "imparting the gift of knowledge" = "imparted secret information" = "being given secret signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven."  But there is notenough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call this "favorable interpretation."  It appears to be closer to "fabrication."=============================Robert Weisspsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

She also predicted the second world war (that is, predictepredicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, whowas not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)She warned there would be "fire in the sky" as a warning that the second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germanyinvaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, fromEngland to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacularreddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary'sprediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils allover the world and persecute religion.  She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Everysingle one has been realized.  One can only use the term "coincidence"so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes ridiculous.  SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. Thereare true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima wasone example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia(or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day foreleven years now.

You are probably thinking of Church of God inChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.2)  I'm not sure what you mean by "signifying believers"  but itshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has itever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain isthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becominga Christian in which one is "Baptized in the Holy Spirit"  That may bewhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals arefrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in orderto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not themajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage inMark 16 about "these signs following them that believe" but they generallydo not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't"saved".3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement thathas such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty biggeneralizations here.  Do "Neo-Pentecostals" only believe in tongues as asign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized themas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues asa sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not beinclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will becharismatic.Ken BannerDept. of Religious StudiesUniversity of Pennsylvaniakbanner@philae.sas.upenn.edu

I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb.  This is recorded for us in Deuteronomy 1:39 "Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it."   At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where they were/are held responsible, and could not enter the "Promised Land", younger ones were not held to the same "rules", at least not by God.| "Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him." || "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit."  || (proverbs 26:4&5)

I wasraised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as anagnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that theChristian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I amhappy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible andquite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am tryingto rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpfulto also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or otherrelevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I wouldlike to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theologicalworks intended for a lay person?I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliatedwith any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteriashould one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the differencebetween the various Protestant denominations.Thanks for reading my post. Sincerely,Steve Hoskins[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider anintroduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Biblecourses.  They give historical background, discussion of literarystyles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for furtherreading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NTintroduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  Theyoften have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the bestrecommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (Ithink there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is afairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with theSociety for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,you will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read alot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by DonaldGuthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's alsoeditor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]

The sermon wasbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending outspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was thatthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were"melting in fear."  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary andknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I feltuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  Onthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the valuesheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved inout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritualwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelitestake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- exceptfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports aboutBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying thatthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really botheredme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, Ishouldn't be so troubled about the reports of "ethnic cleansing" inBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christianswho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doingGod's work?[The example of God's people setting out on bloody wars of conquesthas always been troubling in discussions here.  I personally questionwhether they were right even at the time.  But those who believe theywere consider that the wars were justified only because they werespecifically commanded by God.  Somehow I don't see the Serbs behavinglike a group that is led by God in this matter.  --clh]

And the answer to that question is a resounding YES.To paraphrase the gospel "Many are called but few choose to listen"and so it is with prayer.

I read EVERY letter and thought about each one!! I got all sorts of responses, from "marry her" to "have nothing ever to do with her again"Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I havedecided to do.I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really seriousabout moving away from home to another state that "I would do anything to get you here in NC." I told her that I tried to find out if there were any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, causeI still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less saidthat "Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)"Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. Ifshe was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do ityet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian.It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figurethat if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, itwill happen!She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I knowmore of what to look forward to.I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tellmy folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situationin your prayers..Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email addressfor one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curioushow folks think about what i did.ThanxChris

The question as to whether the Roman canon is not oldereven than that of De Sacramentis is discussed byliturgiologists.  Mgr. Batiffol is of this opinion, but we, onthe contrary, think that the former bears traces of closercomposition, of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy, and thatconsequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis. Weshall see, in studying the list of names in the Memento of theliving and that of the dead, that Mgr. Batiffol argues with goodreason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate ofSymmachus (498-514). We thus have the state of the Roman Mass,or at least of the chief parts of the canon, at the beginning ofthe fourth century.

For   Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith   comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word   of Christ."   So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the   gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to   respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot   be raised in baptism to a new life.Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that'sone primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptismproduces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of anyvolitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby'ssoul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not havewithout Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of hisintellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as thechild gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.   Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the   guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The   righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the   wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."   If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty   for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.Adam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them waswhat Catholics call "sanctifying grace".  (In the New Testament, theword used for this is "charity".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace.He didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the wholehuman race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to hisdescendents.That's why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adamlost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ institutedBaptism to give it back to everyone.Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did; theyare simply lacking in something they need, in order to enter Heaven.

The Most Beautiful Virtues    This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by    Johann Christoph von Schmid    In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,there    lived  an  uprightand  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wifedied,    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one    looked upon an angel.    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her    gender.  Whenshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to    attract the publiceye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in    quietude and peace.    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  whichwas  beaming  in  the    morning sun:    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the    hardest   -5-    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;touch    itbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!    Then pointing to a rose he said:     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure    ofheart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,    asshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  andwan,  and  go    before their time to the grave."    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle    ofthe garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it    blossomed  earlierthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father    and said:    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling    ofred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of    flowers!    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes    once  moreupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all    become  brown  andyellowand  when  thesun came forth in its    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter    tears at the sight. Then said the father:    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree    animage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  hasraisedin  myheart    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I    should   -6-    go down sorrowfully to my grave.    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her    mind that she never forgot them.    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  andwise,  and  amid  the    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiringas  a    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the    fruits  ofhis  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his    pious teaching and example.    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them togetherin  a    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one    tothe  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-    dered still more lovely by being together. In  thesame  way  my    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and    cannot be separated    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought    of the presence of God-- Internet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  Viva Cristo Rey !!

That doesn't mean that thesame people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whetherthe relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle torepresent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least*partly* an empirical question.  In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected becauseover time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think that's thecase with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul'sguidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But inpractice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusionthat nobody can really have that degree of control over another andnot abuse it.  The message you were responding to was asking you to look at theresults from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note:Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating someextremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completelyon that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at leastrelevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn'tlook at the Incest association, because in fact there is no suchassociation.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look atit too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all suchexaminations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of whythere aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is thatsome of them do produce obviously bad results.--clh]

Aside from the book ofDaniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written(predominantly) in Hebrew.There were also other books being written at about this time and laterby Greek-speaking, or "Hellenistic", Jews.  These books are those which arereckoned by many denominations as "Apocrypha".Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is todaycalled the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However,there were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased.This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  Theyalso maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuineteachings from God.By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christianshad come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read insynagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leadersgot together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)onward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  Inparticular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) werenot inspired.At about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon insomewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi-astes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were thosewhich had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of BenSira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christianand Hellenistic writings.Jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by Jewsof his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in histime.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writingswas not based on 'inspiration'.There is plenty more to say, but I do not have time.The passage you quote concerns the book (Rev.) in which it is found.Frank D.

A better translationis "no one can enter...", as in NRSV.  Of course in 3:7, Jesus isaddressing the person who came to him.  There are other places in theNT where he deals with children.

One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.  - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony  without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married  in God's eyes.

I believe as long assomeone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage, theyhave a moral obligation, even if their intention was not right.  Otherpeople are involved in the marriage covenant.  If they believed ingood faith that a marriage occurred, then I think there areobligations created to them.  Of course there are situations whereintent can cause a marriage not to exist.  The classic example is whenit's done as part of a play.

The founder of thissect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be thePromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the majorreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming ofJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the PromisedMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost allthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messengerfrom God have been fulfilled.        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  andextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sectis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won manyadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, whocome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  abouta better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. AhmadiMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffedby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect'sinternal resources.        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moralreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind underone universal religion.NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  willofficially  end.

About 10 years ago, my familyand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across thestreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and havebeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is comingback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So Idrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spentthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even thoughwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to beingin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world couldask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), butshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her familyis one of those families who goes to church but that is about theextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But sheknows I am a Christian. Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever sucha thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kidyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not findingdates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she endedup leaving school....Now we are at the present...Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week...."Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm notgoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. Collegejust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here andthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interestedme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I wasinterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parentscould tell."So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and nowI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant roomM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and it's great experience."As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the verynear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want tostudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple ofyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't beto Kansas."Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district manager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now forabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to chose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on eitherone of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't itbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion."This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD payand any thye of management experience would look good on an applicationor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Goodbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-timeservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitngfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up paying out of state tuition wherever I go."Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I respect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really good. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i wantto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.I don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old femaleis too bad. "Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,MARRY ME..."You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about thehome life later."***********OK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do youthink she meant about the marraige thing?? I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in herletter!!! I don't know what to think??Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???I always pick on those people who graduate from high school andget married....but what does she mean??? I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that I don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) thatmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  theGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and hereshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I amso attracted to paying some real attention to me.I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'monly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling throughclasses..I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..saying, "God if she is the right one, let the situation open up.."Could this be my sign???I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes it worse..Should I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even liketo talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a veryaverage guy like me??I'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.Thanx Chris[I have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk withChris directly via email.  --clh]

In short, many evangelicals claim that they areinfallible on the matter of religious texts.In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you canthink of epistemology as "how do you know?"  That question, it turns out, isa very troubling one.The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some ofthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain thateverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did todiscover a source of truth is in question.And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source ofauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictionalInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea ofPapal Infallibility, too.)Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, andseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (andpossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of AbsoluteTruth.He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have mademistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  Hisconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have mademistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have mademistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything thathappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter whathe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his owninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his ownreasoning, that belief cannot be considered "absolutely certain".Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that beliefis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he cansay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part onyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infalliblethinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doingepistemology: "how do you know?"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion: A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth. B: How do you know? A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church    teachings and came to this conclusion. B: How do you know you studied history correctly? A: Well, I double-checked everything. B: How do you know you double-checked correctly? A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed. B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly? A: ...And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say "Ican't prove that there are no mistakes" -- and as long as you may have made amistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.There is no way out of the loop.This is where the "arrogance of Christians" arises: many people believethat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about thedoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they areinfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has ledyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant. *People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try tofind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attackingthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible isknowably Inerrant.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded."                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein

Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by itsright name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name.It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it isalso true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth.--"Competition is the law of the jungle.

This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.

And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission saidthey couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an"evangelist".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, donot appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for theGeneral Assembly next month.

If I fail to teach my childrenthat stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if theylater indulge in such behavior.This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given inEze 3:18.  If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked, not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would holdEzekiel responsible!

When you encounter references to Heavenin terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you donot suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the goldenstreets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what theconcept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose thatabout the "fires" of Hell?     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember thelast description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside theFerris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meantby Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in thisconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell assomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (asany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLASSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played withmatches).     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word "Gehenna,"one of the words translated "Hell" in the New Testament. It refersto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was aplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)to Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where firesburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem."To be cast into Gehenna" or "to burn in Gehenna" thus became ametaphor for "to be rejected or discarded as worthless."Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggartis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREATDIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (noflames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at mostbookstores and libraries. Yours, James Kiefer

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanxin advance)I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? Thereis this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies."   Thanx in advance... Shaz....[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the styleof the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significantdifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlyingtext.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied byhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscriptsaround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating theoriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they aregenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There aresomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there'smuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christiansbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process oftranslating is free of error.  But I also don't think there'senough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it thatit has much practical effect.Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hottopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on detailsthat don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with therebeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found inall the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on thetitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've beenreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what getreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly beeneditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includeseverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts intosingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editorobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Biblehas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from makingeditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editionsthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars froma variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagineone of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up allinaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any editionthat's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a fewtranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimizeinconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, thereare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,I'm afraid.)--clh]

I know you believe only> god can judge, and I do not ask you to, just for your opinions. excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you  clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,  the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have  already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however  there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not  tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to  live with him on the wrong in your life.   Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The  Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed  punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but  punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  through him it might be saved." when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.  for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  Hell? that step is much more rewarding.stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edumy opinions are my own, you may borrow themp.s. stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as  well, he listens too.

Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case isoften let down by the explicit link which those on thepolitical left make with anti-abortionists andpro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people whohold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were manymore anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their oppositionto capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end thiskneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing,and get many to think seriously about the issue (there areplenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wingreason).I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be takenas support for capital punishment. I take it that as a RomanCatholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsiderit wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by"authority".Matthew Huntbach

But at the time of theRenaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,or the focus of culture (hence "humanism"). This consciousness wasalso secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with thepresent age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at thesame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that itbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western Europeansociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its laterstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values thatjustified them.There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of "economics" -from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, ofcreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forcesand powers. There were denominational differences among the newworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was "the freerein of the market mechanism", while for others it was "thedialectical forces of history". But in both the capitalist West andthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar ofMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e whowere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom tooppose what was happening and state their case.Steve--- GoldED 2.40

Ofcourse, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing ofthe Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is reallylittle excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for thesomewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul.And no comments were taken as flames.

The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what thosetruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible doespreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystalclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear toeveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That islargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writersare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.

This is an improvedversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, "Hermeneutrik und Kritik," _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibleydescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims littleknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subjectand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the formof "rules for forgers."  It makes interesting reading.I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extractthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required andas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancientdocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery.Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For examplethe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientificmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects foundwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actualphysical objects.2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although thecopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find adocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of somethingfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through severalgenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannotexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much sowe must confine our testing to the text itself.It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us ifthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date thedocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heardof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a kingin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn upscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have theholograph).  They could check the language, content and writingstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of aPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results werepositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actuallywrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way todetermine who the actual author was.As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of thetests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  Specifically we might ask:1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradictitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if thewriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would beable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuousthings which someone from that culture would get right without eventhinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speechetc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  If so do they fit in with the culture?Of course there are complications if the document has beentranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated languagewhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the cultureclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems andreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to ask are, "Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin?"  If there are things which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due toour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we neverknow everything about the culture.The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain(particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies).However often it may just be a probability or an indication thatthe document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (orsometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems aresolved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is, however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer.

But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance andgiving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But someof the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Likejews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, "His blood be upon our headsand our childrens heads" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades tothe holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have onlybeen understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmlythe good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but wecannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking andsay those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose apoint of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with thesame legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text.Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we testall things and hold fast to that which is good. > > > p.s.

Since it hasn'tbeen posted for some time (and I've modified it somewhat since thelast time), I'm taking this opportunity to post it.  There is anotherentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  Theycan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu aspub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains farmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, thoughprimarily from a conservative point of view.----------------------------This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality andChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post thequestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarizethe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizesarguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most peopleasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The mostcommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is "how can aChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says aboutit?"First, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe thatthere is a homosexual "orientation", i.e. a sexual attraction tomembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexualsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered bymost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, theterm 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  Inthis paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engagingin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of anyBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation whoremains celebate.I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to behomosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It isnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidencesuggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality isnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One ofthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to helppeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known isExodus International".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read thedetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to thePresbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest thatthese programs have very low success rates, and that there arequestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainlyare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not asimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrongbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The factthat it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevantthan the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  Ifit's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.If it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us morewilling to forgive it.One more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts wherethis came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the sourceof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not byorientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completelyheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience oforgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males havemost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  Thepercentages held true in a followup study done by the KinseyInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not publisheduntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can'tput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the onlineinformation for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalogat Rutgers:   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.

LC CARD    48005195This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has evenbeen found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in therecent NEWSWEEK coverstory "Is this child gay?" (Feb. 24, 1992).  Ajournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promotingher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarlyworld seems to take her for a kook......I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enoughdetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute anotherview, I'd be willing to include it.)Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.Not all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The MetropolitanCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically toaccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allowsit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The EpiscopalChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches thathave congregational government, you'll find a few congregations thataccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probablyonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churchespermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this isanother issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexualpastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's anattempt to summarize the issues:The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance ofhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality", U Chicago Press,1980.The argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit lawsin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative onhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Somepassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out washomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since theentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifyingbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests inthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lotoffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than toallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordancefor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that fewseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewishinterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At anyrate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a setof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NTjustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.The NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of thereferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairlyvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do notmean homosexual.  Here's what he says: The two Greek words that appearin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the wordsactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a varietyof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests"wanton" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimousinterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, wasthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that hasvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be lessfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of theCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  Hetranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that noneof the church fathers understood the term as referring tohomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by theearly Latin translations, would be "active mode homosexual maleprostitute", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on ICor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is notnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associatedwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Feesay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not verydefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, itisn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues againstBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting atranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with itis that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the firstoccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of "male" and"f**k" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since itdoesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of theaction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to basemeaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that "goodbye" is areligious expression because it's based on "God by with ye".  Howeversince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on "homosexual maleprostitute", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that thistranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (somethingwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce intheir translation).In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as somethingthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a resultof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could arguethat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped falsegods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps becomeheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and infact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this iswhat Paul meant.However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a lawagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality thatappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Pauldoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that theirheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I dobelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.But in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is areflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not aspecific feature of homosexuality.My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we haveenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved ofhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 arenot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they donot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved ofhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On theother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on thesubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexualityin passing.The result of this situation is that people interpret these passagesin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who lookto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprisingthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OTprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view ofhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringingwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  Asreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind theseapproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at themouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot Ican do as moderator about such a situation.A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort ofdetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in factI'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base theirown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on thequestion of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modernhomosexuality.One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kindsof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexualityonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it waswrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act"straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are tryingto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christianideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of therelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul'sjudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to makejudgements on these questions.Another is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associatedwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  Itwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it oftenoccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'mnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are somereasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the activeand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adultto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an activemode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  Hiscustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  Thissupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between twofree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsiblepartners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples fromancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involvefree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerationsin this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may havebeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but theresurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did notinvolve slaves or children.)Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement againsthomosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted bypromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has ahomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage isnot at risk for AIDS.Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubtthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,apart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe hisuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexualmarriage as what God ordained.However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warningagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians isnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul'stendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebratingholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issuesto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and toavoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eatmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action aboutwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviouslywould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainlywould rather see them married than in a state where they might betempted to fornication.I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting theviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality isnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but stillconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in thecreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  Thisdoesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  Thequestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinfulor whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sensedue to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latterapproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is moredamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most oftenfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging frompsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages whenattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent natureof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then youmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendencyto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure theseconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions areintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious forhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality areactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includesAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexualrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalentto Christian heterosexual relationships.)In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we'veheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are inthis situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and theresults of various efforts for "conversion".  (Aside from thePresbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizesour readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is thatlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on apar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians todepend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesn't happen,which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feelingexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirementof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a differentcontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and Ithink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced thatjudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gaysex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybehomosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paulpreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christianrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesissuggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think suchrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's lovewith each other.There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying thisdiscussion.  The issue is that of "cultural relativism".  That is,when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as aneternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situationsin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insiston taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomessubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it asrelative?When looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completelyrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number ofjudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christiansconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least asclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times inthe OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here becauseuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it bindingon Christians)  - prohibition against swearing oaths  - endorsement of slavery as an institution  - judgement of tax collectors as sinnerWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe theargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specificagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,but not to our market economy.  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have thesame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus wasconcerned about  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling peoplehow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it asan institution  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent toRoman tax farmingThe point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblicalprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20thCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that theirrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paulwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind ofargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, andmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationshipbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servantsor slaves of God.)I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturallyrelative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, andtherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears inthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether theaction we're talking about now has the same moral implications as theone that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to arguethat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions againsthomosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those whoclaim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kiddingthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obeyall the rules listed above).One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issuecreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter isreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whosewords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising amongChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest topeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are asstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical argumentsas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But Ican't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a wayof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is adangerous situation for Christians.On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems Ihave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologicallydetermined.  I.e. "God made me homosexual", and I have no choice.  Ithink "God made me homosexual" is a fine view for people who alreadybelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But Idon't see it as an argument for acceptability.Many people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drugaddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn't mean it's OK.Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some peopleget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to beattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (ifwe view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these otherthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time oranother having to work to overcome bad habits and particulartemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and saythat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesussaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dyingto self (which also appears throughout Paul's letters) seems tosuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we weare called on not to accept.  Paul's letters and the experience ofChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, andthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact thathomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's OK.Maybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self.  But I'd liketo make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battlesomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians haveto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.

Even here, Iwould not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (justas He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). However, ifsomeone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might havethe responsibility to say, "Remember, if God's help is real, then soare His commands." Yours, James Kiefer

If all that is required is that people are willing to die for abelief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No,the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to bewilling to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn'tseem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree)there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have beendoing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief thateven the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/nationalboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to bewilling to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecutionwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back fromthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the romanor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothingto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest andcannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrectionjust cannot stand up to critical examination.randy

Second, the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son "uncreate" -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius'sopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,if you accept "Nestorianism" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,a la Chalcedon.Second, I am not sure that "Nestorianism" is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnationthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert[There may be differences in what we mean by "subject to sin".  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could callJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought hegot the better of them.However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least"rash and dogmatic" (as the editor of "The Christological Controversy"refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says "To attribute alsoto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood."It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have "to somedegree" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'participation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say "I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus'shuman nature was in heaven."  I don't think that's required byorthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.--clh]

I have a good friendwhose lifestyle is very sinful.  Do I hate the things she does to herselfand others?  Yes.  Do I hate her?  Absolutely not.  In fact, she tells merepeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care abouther very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life.It's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  I'vefelt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important part of Christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possibleto "love the sin but hate the sinner."  Before I look at someoneelse's life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I seein *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness iscontradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression youdescribe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, "Wretchedman that I am!" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be ableto love the sinner and hate the sin.  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee who said, "I thank Thee that I am not like other men..." [Luke 18:11 (NASB)],we will hate both.  -- Scott at Brandeis"But God demonstrates His     "The Lord bless you, and keep you; own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you, while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you; Christ died for us."       the Lord lift up His countenance on you,       and give you peace."-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]

I do remember calling Christianity"silly" and then following that up with information that I was nine yearsold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectuallydishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god'sexistence. I define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", BTW.Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all typesthere, so in answer to your question: "no."Finally, I'd hardly call Christianity "beseiged" in this country. I seldomsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearingcrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, ofcourse, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happeningis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by peoplewho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn'tpracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minoritywho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. >Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting>atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not astudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing andLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implicationsI see are improper, please let me know.I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole asyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something thatwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see"atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserveyour respect?Aw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,here. It's just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. I figure youshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions toyour question.Now, the smoothed feather version:I seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, Iam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* ofChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don'tknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheistsI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheistmotives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), butwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       I'm hoping people reallywant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out severalreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and Iactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with theimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken"people are atheist.Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the naturalstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so manypeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn'tfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenousmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tendto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religionsso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which "breaks" people.It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is anotherreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies :).>I have a >difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>about the subject.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anythingabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think myreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested thatatheists are "broken", hostile people. This post confirms that someoneelse believes it. >>Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says                                              ^^^^^^^^^^>he will need to be proven wrong about it. Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack ofevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implieslack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who saidthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a "seeker" if you like, Idon't. _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say "Idon't believe in any god" rather than my position: "I believe that nogod(s) exist." For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,because they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this isconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants andMethodists from an atheist point of view :).This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes insomething (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). Guess what?My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Isthat really too much to ask?>Well, I don't even waste my time trying. Well, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why thesupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Isit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) > I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it.And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note thatI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm "broken"?I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and thatyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of afundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how youthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion "God exists".

Three + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; + but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my + power is made perfectr in weakness."He does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moralproblem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. Heordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note andhis signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,"See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand," or else, "Seewhat a long letter I have written with my own hand." If the formertranslation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in thesmall script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letterslarger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to theGalatians (4:13-15), + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.Perhaps this last line means simply, "You would have done anythingfor me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes)."But in that case, we would expect some wording like, "If I hadneeded them." "If it were possible" sounds as though the bodilyailment was connected with his eyes.William Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specificsuggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, hehad been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had hada malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him toleave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might wellhave given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.

From a theological bent, those who livedimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his sonNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had astronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause ofhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting onhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting. It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, andthus he became the "Elevator of the heavens."  This "god" made men able to"feel" as if heaven were afar off and "as if either the God of Heaven could notsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers ofHis laws."  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled "Emancipator"or "Deliverer"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal systemand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given manybenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as aDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the otheractually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept itas true.>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is>an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam>or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward tothe coming "Anointed One" and put their faith in the fact that it was God whowas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to theCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, thedispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see itas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvationvia faith and nothing else.>It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The>relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely>extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of itbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with theeternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternallife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation ofconsciousness.  >It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous>were lost. It depends upon your def of "lost."  The elect were lost only in time asoutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.

But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want theunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as "mystery" religionsfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the privateside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if theyrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachingsto light. The "Mystery of Iniquity" that we find in the Bible, correlates tothis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it wouldnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in pointtoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris inEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the "husband son.")>On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity>that originated most definitely in a pagan source.

I know what you're alluding to in that thechurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into theirworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If youare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came toexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that whichthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned anddiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and alsothe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's "Egyptians."  He reallydoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they "pilfered" from theEgyptians. > He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same>time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our>eternal spiritual being had grown dim.I'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.

The early creeds do not spell these things outin detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there wasinsufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools thatwe have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  Oneage has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine isgiven growth.

Let us say a littleThe ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved aredisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the differentcongregations were always competing and arguing about which one wasbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anythinginto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I'vefound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, theyare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back inJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (thisretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known eventhe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciplethe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  Oneof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is onlyone area in which disciples stand out from "Christians".  Also, anotherpart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part ofsome "Christian" campus fellowships who were focused on unity betweenchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack ofconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could beunified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting alongtogether.>The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches>(denominations) with the same characteristics.

What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmlybetter?>So, here is a first question:>- can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different>  denominations? Or is this definitely an untolerable situation>  according to the Scriptures?According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are goingto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are thosewho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinionand belief.  However, Scripture states:     In the following directives I have no praise for you, for yourmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that whenyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to someextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you toshow which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), butbefore that, there are these qualities:   devotion to the apostles teaching   fellowship   communion   filling with awe for God   all having everything in common.   glad and sincere hearts   praising God   enjoying the favor of the peopleAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those whohave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, "a man full offaith and of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts7:54-60).  >- can one say that only one of these three churches is the>  true church of Jesus Christ?One can say that a church is the true church only if that church isperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  Ihave yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the BostonChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errorspointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which istotally sold out to God.>>A problem closely related to these question is:>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - >  before there is a unity? This question is especially important>  for those who think that only one church can be the "true one".>As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand maynever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the"true one", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there aredisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but theywill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heardnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out therethat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make themany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever runinto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.I know I haven't.>Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you.>For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which>are founded by people of one specific church and whose members>are all members of that church.

A clique is a group whichruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problemsin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this issomething "correct" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one ofthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique ofpeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizationalheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside ofthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without anotheroffice being "opened up" so that they would have to step right back in.Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, henearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish hewould've since they still have no clue about what it means to be adisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to bebroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such divisionwithin.  There's enough division without.>Thanks for your opinions in advance!>>MaartenJoe Fisher

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically   stood by the Pope.The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  Thisis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: hisdeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commandsfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must bedisobeyed.My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a majorway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; itwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view thepresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in theCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over   authority and discipline.  The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the CatholicFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about theCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erringbishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects theshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by theCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for anhour, probably.Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a bookon what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antoniode Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in thewake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same oldcatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, theCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  Heinnoculated the people against what was coming.Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It camewhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Poperecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope reallywanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishopwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer'sclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the NewMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishopwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help ofthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  Thepriests would just start building new churches; the people werecompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as thebishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according tocanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying thetraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.During all this process, the people of Campos, not just privateindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sendingpetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernistbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this: Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX don't jointly make such  choice.)   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.   If I adopt the view that "I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours", that   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the endof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood inCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is aninstant non-Catholic.The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on inthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops aredoing, they would be shocked!   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real"   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive bodyof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years areespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditionaldoctrine is.   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`   I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great jobsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errorsspread that it's pitiful.Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In theshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  Infact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: largesections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has beenmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the longrun.   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?   Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.   Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,   one way or the other.Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But whatis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression ofthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholicschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except forthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the   Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.Not really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels atcritical thought, remember?  That's what Catholic theologians havebeen busy at for centuries.

Andrew Kille writes:>Are you suggesting that God supports genocide?>Perhaps the Germans were "punishing" Jews on God's behalf?> >Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of>my worship or faith.The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13). And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It isjust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, theinevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard tograsp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they aredoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), itmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead tothe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as ispossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in theeyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just desertsnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killingpeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, andAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that Hisplan might be accomplished.    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation toexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used tofulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd inJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punishother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene,tekel, peres?"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God'sjustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persiansas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is theextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, andthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could goon with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point isquite clear.Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us toquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message ofJesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is athand."  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Letthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me."  There is not an infiniteamount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people tofollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, "well, alright,you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with yourplans."  He said "Follow me."  His message is NOT "I'm just a sweety-piewho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, andDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale."  "Our great God and Savior"Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of theworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to bequestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.D. Andrew Byler"Does not He who ways the heart perceive [sin], and will He not judgemen according to their works?" - Proverbs 24.12

We are notsaved by what we do.  However,15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.(John 14:15).Keeping Christ's commandments is a "work" per se, and a demonstration ofour love for him.  Also,6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in hisvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three yearsI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; whycumbereth it the ground?8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till Ishall dig about it, and dung it:9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut itdown.(Luke 13:6-9).Again,16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that yeshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: thatwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.(John 15:16).It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit beinglove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifestin the actions that we carry out.If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the thingsChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which bladeon a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of yourpants is more important.Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parableabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christscommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,then we shall be uprooted just like the tree. It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actionsprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk fordays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off abuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell youall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't havethat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take thetest.  Words and talk mean nothing.I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, butthis should be sufficient.Hope it helped.Jon----------------sig file broken....please try later...----------------

(Yes, my opinion.)I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be learned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be necessary.It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to person.

I believe that God transcends our simple minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute,then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong.I just don't believe that God is that rigid.> >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture > >to be absolute truth.

To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:   1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and   anachronisms.   2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices   which are at variance with sacred Scripture.   3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of   subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.   4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine   Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and   poetic and religious feeling.First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highlysubjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another bookof the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, insome way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness oftheir composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of thebooks, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of thecanonical books (i.e. Daniel).Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have beenoriginally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ innature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in therejection of these books from the various canons.These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which tojudge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions haveshown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purelyobjective standards for determining canonicity.Nichael;(and (funcall (get 'smurfy-smile-icon 'like-predicate) 'lisp) (sys::honk))

The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quotefrom the Deuterocanon.

And ofthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of theApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the sameto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of theApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse ofJohn."-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at whichcouncil the same list was enumerated with the words "Because we haverecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in theChurch."  Which ought to quiet those who assert "in the name of HolyScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there wasnever any doubt in the Church," as the Episcopal Church does in removingthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalianshold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are notcounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  TheLutherans hold out similarly.)Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can alsobe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling itdivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers."And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned asconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to thenumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted alsothat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,corresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks."-St. Hillary of Poitiers, "Commentaries on the Psalms," prologue, 15 (365 AD)"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, withLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there isMaccabees."-Origen, "Commentaries on the Psalms," Psalm 1 (245 AD)"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and tothe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows]."-St. Clement of Alexandria, "The Instuctor of Children," 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs ofSolomon, and also Wisdom ..."-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' "History of theChurch," and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14"It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divineScriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she mustshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;Ecclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; ofMaccabees, two books."-St. Damasus I, Pope, "The Decree of Damsus," section 2 (382 AD)I would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Churchhas always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputedby various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testamentdeutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2Peter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neithershould it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out thatthe Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the foundingof the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to acanon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitianuse of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As earlyas 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating theCanon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestantsapparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decreeof the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews') faithless canon, andthat he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up thecanon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, andnot the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon.

Dr. James DeYoung; #3]R. Scroggs     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors andsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinicterminology."  The term is derived from Lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the LXXjuxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and representsthe Hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male").   Yet he believes that Paul didnot originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of Hellenistic Jewsacquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid"contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108).  If this is true, Scroggsobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussionsof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless tonative-speaking Greeks (108).     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as theobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's "learned discussion"(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with amale" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),which Scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is theactive partner "who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him onoccasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does notrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the genericmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, heaffirms (109).     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  Thecombination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slavedealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slavedealers [who procure them]" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form ofpederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexualpurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121).  Even "seriousminded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses theseinstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparentlygeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. Consequently Paul "Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122).We cannot know what Paul would have said about the "contemporary model ofadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122).     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethicalconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list ofvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form andfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Anyrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usuallynonexistent.  He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item inthe lists" (104).      Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literaryphenomenon of a "catalogue of vices,"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129).  The "modelin today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the modelattacked by the NT" that "Biblical judgments against homosexuality are notrelevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominationaldiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justifyrefusal of ordination. . . " (127).      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAID. Wright     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs havecome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell'sview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points outseveral shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faultsBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the "ApostolicConstitutions,"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the termderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  Thisis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell'sclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but thegender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps witha male," making arseno- the object.     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of theterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims thatcompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ itas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merelyone of dialectical diversity: "No semantic import attaches to the differencebetween the two forms" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in whichthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes itsobject and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes itsgender" (132).      It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wrighttakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of malehomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to citeHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and theSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical tothe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34).      Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai inparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, thedominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes thisparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of theTen Commandments as "You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commitadultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality withboys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43).     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in theSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word wascoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented byOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drewupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in Johnthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea ofhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not beabsent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior tothe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks useddozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citingScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41).      Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives along uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wrightobserves that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us ofarsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexualactivity" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical natureand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearlyspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world.      Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Timand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning"homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half ofthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limitedconclusion based on them.     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about thecatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developedin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation ofhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on thepart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came intobeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke "generally ofmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexualengagement with paides" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria wereinterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaninghomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, andothers who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are withoutsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  [Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, weget into the "good" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis willinclude "Symposium" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modernunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time ofPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use ofLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not doneaway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters thegeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in ourculture, should stick around for this one.]___________________________13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. Independently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection ismade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from146BC to AD 1100).14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language inRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.Zaas, "I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitaiwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of thevice list, "and such were some of you," indicate that "Paul is addressing realor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition byrote" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry(147).15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, "RelationsNatural and Unnatural"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1," JRE14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.16  D.F. Wright, "Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (ICor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, "ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,"effectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. He finds the meaning to be general, "a male who has sex with a male" (4-11).  18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all thereferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.DeYoung, "A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha andPseudepigrapha," BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitaipoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,and why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?"  (152 n.71)  In a more recent article, "Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible," EvQ61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a"remarkable originality" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).

And that is where this sort of>discussion ultimately ends.Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the church's history.It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in thechurch, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage,and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD).Yet Eerdman's History of the Church says: "At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard tothe extent of the canon, or the number of the books which shouldbe acknowledged as divine and authoritative.   The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally received, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek versionof the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as bookssuitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class betweencanonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings.And justly; for those books, while they have great historicalvalue, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New,all originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannotbe therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever citedby Christ or the aposteles.""In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closedat the end of the fourth century through the authority ofJerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and theprinciple of tradition), and more especially of Augustine,who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint,and the preponderant tradition in reference to the CatholicEpistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in someplaces, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocryphaas *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority."This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both theCouncil of Hippo and of Carthage.It is interesting to note, however, the following footnote tothe fourth session of the Council of Trent.  The footnote lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical books, but then says "The Tridentine list or decree was thefirst *infallible* and effectually promulgated declarationon the Canon of the Holy Scriptures."Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not officialuntil Trent.  Thus my previous erroneous statement wasnot entirely groundless.It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trentwent on to uphold "the old Latin Vulgate Edition" of the Scriptures as authentic.

For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitionspassed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception".So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over andover in her mind so as not to forget it before she told thepriest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, thepriest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know whatyou are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactlyit meant but she was just too happy to have the answer forthe priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you rememberthis if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly thatshe had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on herway to the priest...The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer whichthe priest finally observed and took as proof of an authenticpersonal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water whichour lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with herbare hands in front of pilgrims.

Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you find the declaration that there are 2 laws (ceremonial and moral), but I am also unclear on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first place.  If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law that is different from the moral law (and vice versa)?I would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor. 10:1-16, where Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying depending on whether you are a man or a woman.  Do you think the apostles can prescribe different sets of rules for men and women?  If so, then why not for Jews and Gentiles?  Also, why did Paul, who was so opposed to circumcising Gentiles, voluntarily circumcise Timothy?- Mark

Christianity is not the cause of the massacresand horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the faultof people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modifyit to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter theirambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable inthe New Testament.  With every truthful and good message thatcarries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitablefact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distortedway, with inevitable consequences.The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, andthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message ofrepentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people havedeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this messagearound and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.One of the problems is that you look at the world throughthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will findmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated bypeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not sayingthis to justify the massacres that were, but I am merelypointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that wewould have the same freedoms in the countries in which welive, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) whichwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate suchsubjects.Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst forpower, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame ata message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, inlove for others.Yours in Christ,Andrew McVeighp.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presentedis, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian.Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviourof the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God forJesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefsand still come back to God and be forgiven, time and timeagain.--*****Andrew McVeigh

Itwas a pleasure to read them." MY REPLY...You are welcome, Zane. Zane..."I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but Iwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.I mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that youhave read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain thatwill result in your Christian life?" MY REPLY...(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture! (2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith "cult" in my area - it's    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and    has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6). (3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk    to him at length about these issues. (4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as    my lending CIC to people in the church. I'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement andhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.What heresies?    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became        one with him.    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling        over Him there.    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after        the resurrection.    F. We are gods. These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachingsupon request. Zane..."Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out andjoining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplatingjoining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been savedfrom all of that?" MY REPLY...It wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet bySwaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendousdocumentation and insights. Zane..."I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting." MY REPLY...Why do you call it "heresy hunting"?  "Hunting" implies it isn't readilyaccessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement inChristendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has soldmore books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  FredPrice has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn'tsound like much "hunting" is needed. It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to exposeerror and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther? Zane..."I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt hereticsoften end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un-documented opinion." MY REPLY...(1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated.(2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes    disunity and immaturity in the body. EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge ofthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullnessof Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carriedabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunningcraftiness of deceitful plotting.... Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it'scaused by error. Zane..."There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures asdocumenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I wouldsuggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows andmatures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End." MY REPLY...Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitionsto Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become... 2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which wascommitted to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, thatall those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus andHermogenes. 2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesnot need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profaneand idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And theirmessage will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, whohave strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is alreadypast; and they overthrow the faith of some. 2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, ifGod perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, andthat they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, havingbeen taken captive by him to do his will. 2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and makecaptives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now asJannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men ofcorrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress nofurther, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was. 2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will sufferpersecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceivingand being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learnedand been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that fromchildhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wisefor salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given byinspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, forcorrection, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may becomplete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince,rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will comewhen they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires,because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; andthey will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of anevangelist, fulfill your ministry. 2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay himaccording to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatlyresisted our words. Zane..."The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroythe ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears,the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed intowolves to protect themselves." MY REPLY...ACT 20:26-31 "Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of theblood of all men. "For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counselof God. "Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whichthe Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which Hepurchased with His own blood. "For I know this, that after my departure savagewolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. "Also from amongyourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away thedisciples after themselves. "Therefore watch, and remember that for three yearsI did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears. Zane..."For all the warning Paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a nameof a wolf....  - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over thosewho have abandoned him - everyone in Asia wasn't it ?" MY REPLY...Paul mentioned names... 1TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to theprophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the goodwarfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected,concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus andAlexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. 2TI 1:15 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, amongwhom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 2TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to moreungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetusare of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that theresurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. 2TI 4:10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and hasdeparted for Thessalonica--Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia. 2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay himaccording to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatlyresisted our words. So did John... 3JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have thepreeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will callto mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. Andnot content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbidsthose who wish to, putting them out of the church. Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines... REV 2:14-16 "But I have a few things against you, because you have there thosewho hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling blockbefore the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commitsexual immorality. "Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of theNicolaitans, which thing I hate. 'Repent, or else I will come to you quicklyand will fight against them with the sword of My mouth. REV 2:20-23 "Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allowthat woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce Myservants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. "And Igave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent."Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with herinto great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. "I will kill herchildren with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searchesthe minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to yourworks.

MY REPLY...I won't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others.But even if they had bad motives, remember what Paul said... PHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some alsofrom good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely,supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowingthat I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that inevery way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this Irejoice, yes, and will rejoice. Zane..."If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which youlist - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds ofdoctrines, I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noeticpasture to be nailed to the Cross." MY REPLY...Please explain. Zane..."Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships -which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church." MY REPLY...If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not beneeded to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is beingtaught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but allover the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materialsthe sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadershipbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that. Also, let's examine a passage of Scripture...* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, someevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for theedifying of the body of Christ, These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for oneindividual church, but for "the body of Christ".Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was alsoa teacher -1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved andfaithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teacheverywhere in every church.1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called eachone, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches. Also -1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, secondprophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,administrations, varieties of tongues. * EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge ofthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullnessof Christ; Notice that the "Five-Fold" ministries are going to be around "till" the churchis in "unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfectman".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hindersmaturity and unity of the body? * EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carriedabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunningcraftiness of deceitful plotting, It's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church "by the trickery ofmen" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritualimmaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are"tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine". The "Five -Fold" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clearScriptural denominational boundaries ("pastors" appear responsible for theirindividual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in theirstruggle to equip the body. All believers are called to do this to a degree...JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning ourcommon salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contendearnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. Forcertain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for thiscondemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and denythe only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Zane..."If you'll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church toChurch and area to area, were the "bad guys" and they went after the "good guy"namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic." MY REPLY...They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preachingcontrary to what they taught! Zane..."Let's face it, the wolves are here for a reason.  And we are here for theReason.  And let's hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs." MY REPLY...Yes!2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,                                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, havingbeen taken captive by him to do his will.

Lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately.First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing.Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As wellas by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read hiswork.)Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read hisintroduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, heexplains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although hebelieved in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem topresume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their ownsuffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himselfas some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than whathe considered himself to be -- "a great coward." OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to beembarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, ispart of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far frombeing embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at thesoundness and clarity of the arguments he presents. - Phil -Hey, we're talking about the PHONE COMPANY, here.

We were  having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me  if you have seen this before...Should Christians fight?Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there  are such things as "justifiable wars". I have started looking into these  things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all  his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post  some more info soon.Our duty to our neighbour:Do good to all men (Gal 6:10)Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in  trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).Christians are by faith "citizens of the commonwealth of Israel"  (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that "God rules in the kingdoms of  men", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.We are to be "strangers and pilgrims" amongst the nations, so we are just  passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  are not supposed to "strive" or "resist evil" (even "suffer yourselves to  be defrauded") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  God's kingdom.Our duty to the state."Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  the things which be God's" (Luke 20:25)."Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  the power, resisteth the ordinance of God" (Rom 13:1-2)."Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men" (1 Pet 2:13-15)These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  it. The reason for this is that we are God's "bond servants" and His  service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  3:22-23 where bondservants were to "work heartily as unto the Lord" - so  also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. "Pressed down, shaken  together, and running over"... oops - a bit of a side track there...In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  not fighting in the battle, but is "testifying" to the truth.When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become "fellow  citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God", and are no longer  interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  unions etc as well. Paul tells us to "lay aside every weight" that we may  run "the race that is set before us", and if we are wise, we will discard  any association which would retard our progress - "Thou therefore endure  hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  chosen him to be a soldier" (2 Tim 2:3-4).One of these entanglements he warns about is "be ye not unequally yoked  together with unbelievers". One of the obvious applications of this is  marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  servitude, and Jesus says "take my yoke upon you", so we are then yoked  with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says "become not ye the  bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  "Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?". The situation here is a good  example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had "sold himself to work  wickedness before the Lord" (1 Kings 21:25).2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  "I am as thou art, my people as thy people" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  yoking.3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  association he had made.God says to us "Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  daughters" (2 Cor 6:17).This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  relationship (Rom 6:12,16).No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  master.Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  anyone but God.The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  further.--Gideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347University of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529Department of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nzP.O.

Also very good is "Re: Question about the Virgin Mary" by Micheal D.Walker.  He tells the story very well.I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate "TheDormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)".  TheIcon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostleswho are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding whatseems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Mary's soul already withChrist in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for usas Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows thegeneral resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprisedto find Mary's body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of theSavior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Wordof God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.  This is why wepray in the Orthodox Church, "Through the prayers of the Theotokos,Savior save us."Timothy Richardsonrich0043@student.tc.umn.edu

In all the time I've been reading aboutMary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary thatdid not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scripturalfoundation.  I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parentsas compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for theirhumility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga-mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives mean image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or humandesire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knewtemptation, albeit without submitting to it.I also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some-how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inabilityto grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or-dinary human being.  I won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc.,since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think welose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we makehis parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.  --paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........  .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . . .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .    .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

Those that wouldn't consider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities don't require a personal commitment to Jesus, which is only tangentially related to the Formula of Chalcedon.  -- Thanks, John Kolassa, kolassa@bio1.bst.rochester.edu[As I understand the recent discussion here, the Copts for allpractical purposes accept Chalcedon.  They talk about one naturerather than two, but the issue seems to be one of terminology ratherthan substance.  --clh]

If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then>JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understoodthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,at the same time, he is God's son "For God so loved the world that he gave hisonly begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how couldhe really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak,then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to thehuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To tryand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In thatcase, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationshipisn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually Godincarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just Godmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someonewho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paidto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he wouldrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeinghow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly bodymay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physicalpain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have muchmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the onlyone was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be veryoffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept mysincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious. [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In thisgroup, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  Youseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider thatterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The VirginBirth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn'timply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no meansthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In aTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who isa part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn'tspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Sonwho was incarnated.--clh]

How much closer to the source can you get?The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as "inspired by God", literally means "God-breathed".  In other words, God spoke the actual words into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of "inspired by God".>The only way you would be able to escape this notion of>     "second-hand" info is to have had the entire Bible>     written by God himself.

If there is no God, which seems to be yourcurrent belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because notonly did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regardsto C.S.

Modern Pentecostalism was developingas a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance andindwelling of the Holy Spirit.Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became knownas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement wasin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 1960's),many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches andby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groupsand spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even theCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups...stillevident today.The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestantgroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, itwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly resistantto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as itunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out tocollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus Evangel-ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people beganto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of Christ.In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or foradvocating the "Holy Spirit Movement", another name for the new branch.  Theterm "Underground Church of Christ" also came into use because these people hadto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships werereceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never reallycaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, andthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also seemedto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas tobe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with manyother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring Break.They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.They also worked with UF sports people.In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longerappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a namethat would become legendary.By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programswere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt thatthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinalproblems at Crossroads.Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require attendanceat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to haveat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all ofyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer Partners,which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  Theleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.The book called "The Master Plan of Evangelism" was a strong influenceon Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's dutyand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growingin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).A person who "was evangelistic" was "spiritual".  Evangelism meantinviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of themconverted, then you were "spiritual".  There were sermons about how if youbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations toservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since thesepeople needed Jesus, you should be "aggressive"--don't take 'no' for ananswer.If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called "lazy" or"unspiritual".By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated intoa structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Thenthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in hadsomeone placed over them.It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroadsbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campuswas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediateproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its "pushy"evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christto be "dead" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruitingout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, butalso they were sending out "planting" [create a new church] and "reconstructing"[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, theCrossroads Movement was underway.A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in Boston,MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of afraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view ofchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the congregationthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrongwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-oneChristianity.  [Called this by critics]In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want tobe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming intothe new Boston Church of Christ.Ah, but I'm ahead of myself.At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll onthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, butthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers weredropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadershipbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely"unproductive" and "unfruitful".  The "fruit" passages in the NT were interpretedas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, youwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to churchand convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical argumentscontinue in this vein.In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to recurringsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation atlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  Forby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between mostCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus shouldbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of theBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' sessionsfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-roads ready to emphasize the "total commitment" to the church that Boston andKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come underthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their beliefthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston Churchesof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, sinceCrossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The groupnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessaryelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could bebaptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a stepfurther.  If at some time you became "unproductive", then your spiritualitywas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what youwere getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  theyhadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others calledthis "rebaptism", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of itsmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which werenow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) oryou were "dead".  They also used the nickname "Movement of God" for a while.By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and nowstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,and now none in the Movement.Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction thatthey had been following.  They sent "reconstruction teams" to many cities, whichusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging otherchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the "remnant".The "remnant" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It wasfelt that the "remnant" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes theywould simply call their Movement "the church".They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to theother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Manycampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting theredue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented thatBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to haveaccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed "perse-cution", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you reallya Christian if you're not being persecuted?The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they havefought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at theleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) asGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands andobedience.Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by theCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  Theterm "cult" is usually differentiated from "sect" by the practice of thosetechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as beingtechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other ShepherdingDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and manyothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt motivation,emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sortof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'fallingout' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they teach.I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend theirmistakes either.I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems whichare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as muchvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoysmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feelaccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  Whenmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feelpersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are manyexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston bulletins)that I could include.  But this is too long already.

My views on this topic have evolvedand clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as much as we think. I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity,and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew upin EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong placefor me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservativeChristianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians who didn't adhere to the EC model.I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of room for others' opinions.I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are very careful that you don't hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes that everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours, based on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God.

What does>the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with>regard to this issue?This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much,and probably has not been studied much.As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately onpersonality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come upto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for bypersonality type summary file.One observation is that people have significantly different personalities(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respectto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, whileother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a moresolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized ifconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots ofpeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, andcreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I amquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churchesto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be veryuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overlyinfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, bothpreferences have their place in the Body).Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these wordsare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvertscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following isexcerpted from my summary:1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                          world of people, activities or things.        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches canstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprisethe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalitiesto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspectsof how churches have not properly understood personality variances amongtheir members to the detriment of all.Jon Noring-- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.If you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.=============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          || JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE || 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    || Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |=============================================================================Who are you?

It's a very biblical doctrine asRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Churchhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to saythat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in freewill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is alsoaffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists andJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up withthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of finalperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that thosewithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew theirobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not needit, as they had freely chosen hell.  ^^^^^^^^^^^People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their owneffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestinedthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perishbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they weredeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, andsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that>punishment at the last judgement. Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody someblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  Andthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this oneor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporalpunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder wereforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And Ineed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement isquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred fromthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.> if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this isnot a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should wenot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more>innocent?We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), butdoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with theU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am anisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But inthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarilyinvolved, it would not be a "just war."  "Blessed" after all, "are thepeacemakers" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Ouractions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which isunrelated to anything to justify it for us.Andy Byler

This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijahwould return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot anddid not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John theBaptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John(remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet toElijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wanderedrough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses thatdescribe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references aboutElijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing theparallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the SufferingServant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.A brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.Rick.________________________________________________________________Richard Johnston                             Queen`s University73 Malone Road                               BelfastBelfast                                 Northern Ireland                          BT9 6SB                                   u9245669@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk________________________________________________________________

Life, to me, is definitely NOT meaningless; it has precisely thepurpose and meaning I choose to give it. I go on living because I _like_living; if I needed any further reason, I'd be free - completely free! -to pick any reason that suited me. That freedom can be almostintoxicating; it's probably the closest I've ever been to a 'religious'experience.

That would normally be a non-issue with me, but hefeels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is,according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  Iwould have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does,the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offendedbecause I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended bywhat I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by suchcircular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us inthe Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince himthat this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preservewhat is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a greatfriendship?

If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she   could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin   and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite   it's basically patriarchical structure?She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin,but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This waspossible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God,and everything that flows from that relationship.The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in theearly Church use this particular figure a lot.)Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  Mary is themother of all the living in the order of grace.  As sin came throughEve, so Grace -- Jesus Christ -- came through Mary.

My father told me when he was growingup Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced.There are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce becameacceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longera sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each personhas their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the"thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, butwho knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible"with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Biblewarns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges,etc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christianswho have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who havegiven in to greed, get 'em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that hewas the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexualsfeel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatiblewith Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someonetry to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus needus to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?Think about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners andthe Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees,hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins anddid not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  WhatI take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins,those sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sinare guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of othersare guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged othersof.The poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers, those who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.Joe Moore

It warmed my heart to know that 2people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they areindeed very rich.

The church is to last for all time.However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  Thisis evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the"super-apostles" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentionshow people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some willabandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some willsearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4).Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them(Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse14:  "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole worldas a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."  Even today,there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiarwith:  the non-need of baptism and the "praying of Jesus into your lifefor salvation".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have beentaken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and justplain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 andLuke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  Thechurch Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.

I have tried to correct as much as possible.ABOUT THE AUTHORPeter Hammond is the founder of Frontline Fellowship, amissionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries inSouthern Africa. He has also made several visits to many EastEuropean countries.FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS                          ISSN 1018-144XPRAYING FOR JUSTICE(by Peter Hammond)To those involved in ministering to Christians sufferingpersecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source ofcomfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to lifeof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography orcrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon Godhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.THE IMPRECATORY PSALMSEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers forjudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how torespond to them. Prayers such as:"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account forhis wickedness ..." Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with thegospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearlymotivated by love for God ("The Lord is King for ever and ever;the nation will perish from His land" 10:16, and "Why does thewicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent whosuffer ("You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; Youencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending thefatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,may terrify no more." 10:17-18)Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading suchgraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: "Pour out yourwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them" 64:24; "OLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, OJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve."95:1-2; "Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let themvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... Therighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathetheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, "Surelythe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God whojudges the earth.'" 58:6-11Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeplydestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually prayfor God to "pour out His wrath" on the wicked?The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to beprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and againstHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of theseimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart andwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who "boast of evil"and "are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plotsdestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practisedeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather thanspeaking the truth." 52:1-3; "They crush your people ... Theyslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless." 94:5-6; "With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plotagainst those You cherish." 83:3; "You hate all who do wrong. Youdestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men theLord abhors." 5:5-6.To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin" 52:5;"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those whogo on in their sins" 68:21.And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: "Thenit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ..."59:13; "to proclaim the powers of God" 68:34; "All kings will bowdown to Him and all nations will serve Him " 72:11; "Who knowsthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fearthat is due You. " 90:11Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms includeimprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon thewicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are muchmore common.PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORSAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola Ifound the survivors of communist persecution including thecrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God tostrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heavenpray "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judgethe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" Revelation6:10).The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was AgestinoNeto. Described as a "drunken, psychotic, marxist poet", Neto hadbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.He boasted that: "Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or achurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity." Yetdespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it isnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table inMoscow.In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recordedof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car     crash the very next day.  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.     "They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the     Lord spread widely and grew in power. " Acts 19:17,20Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of thepersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army andexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of "theantiChrist is dead" in the streets. Many testified that this wasin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people ofRomania.Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was SamoraMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machelwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies inthe 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he woulddestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first trulyMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches inMozambique were closed confiscated, "nationalised" chained andpadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibleswere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,including many pastors and elders, were shipped off toconcentration camps - most were never seen again.A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publiclyand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches werespecifically praying for God to stop the persecution inMozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violentthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa'sboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plansfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered andpublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,but He had also saved a country from persecution.In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections inZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted toChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was electedpresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christiancountry.It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,declared trembling and in tears: "I am more afraid of John Knox'sprayers than of an army of ten thousand".On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South AfricanCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedentedinternational wave of condolences and adulation reported onecould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and amartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of ChristJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africathis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 peoplewere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collectiveconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head ofthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of othervictims. Indeed the SA government, the international communityand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reportedover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africansmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC wereunbanned!Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's "militarywing" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hanihad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of manyunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: "all who live by the swordwill die by the sword " Matt 26:52.After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activitiesat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publiclydeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, YasserArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombsand limpet mines in public places during "the struggle") I toldhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I didhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would eitherbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that Godwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that hewas an atheist.Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hanito repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches inAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms againstunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struckdown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,within months of these public prayers for God to stop thesekillers of preborn babies.Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terrorto evildoers " Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that anyChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatoryprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so didour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues Iwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, "WarPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The ImprecatoryPsalms" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian andReformed Publishing Company):Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantlyin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes theOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NTare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as"devilish", "diabolical ", "unsuited to the church", and "Not God's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers ofa man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus'teaching that we should love our enemies. "Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that theman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. "(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond ourcomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning itsinspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evilis to impudently take the place of God.Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of Godhave led many to become "evangelic plastic surgeons who have madeit their job to "clean up" God's Word according to their ownideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alonewho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable forHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question theauthority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening toSatan's question "Yes, hath God said... ?").The Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and Hisattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as theauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which theseevangelical plastic surgeons reject as "unsuited" and "unworthy"for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify aboutHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostlesused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especiallyPs 109):"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passagewhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit injudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord wouldspeak to us therein. "The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of thegiver of that Word, God Himself.2. Who is praying these Psalms?Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actuallyspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied anenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayerbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and atthe Last Supper.On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancientauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very ownwords - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's SonHe truly was."Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit" Ps 31:5"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" Ps 22:1In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge onthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!Matt 7:23 "Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Awayfrom me, you evildoers'. " Ps 6:8In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having saidthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22directly to Christ despite there being no record of His havingspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believedChrist is speaking in the Psalms.Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy inall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come againto execute Judgement on the wicked.David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was aprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of theresurrection of Christ. "David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and inhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiahspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also byChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through Hisforerunner David.The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice ofGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassionfor the wronged.3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice forour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged withthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts forwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was thesubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah53)."God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him wemight become the righteousness of God. " 2 Cor 5:21In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, havebeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: StAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying theimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the LordJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It isonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroyHis enemies.These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies ofKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealedupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way offorgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful cursesof God.He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer areality when He declares to those on His left:"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire preparedfor the devil and his angels. " Matt 25:41All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God'sKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alonewill reign forever!"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes asharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rulethem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury ofthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. "Rev 19 : 154. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory?What about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless thosewho curse us (Matt 5:44)?Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgivessin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgementon those who disobey His Gospel."God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble youand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen whenthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with Hispowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospelof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlastingdestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and fromthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified inHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who havebelieved. " 2 Thess 1:6-10Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power onearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we seeboth the vengeance and the love ot God.Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations."Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full ofgreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! Youbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? "Matt 23In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to Hisbetrayal by Judas.We also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing arenot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is onlypraying to the elect of God - those who have:"obeyed your Word"... "accepted" God's Word ... and have"believed ". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject themessage of God's kingdom will be judged.)5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: "Hallowed be ThyName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done " then "he must put allthe opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictionsand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. Maythey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes andwisdom and plans run aground' . "To pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit thedestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: "The God ofheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... itwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but itwill itself endure forever. "* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat forthe kingdom of darkness. *There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Churchcannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God'skingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom beingdestroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without thedestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction ofevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalismwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rightsof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who "plottogether" against God and His people:"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name OLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera andJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became likerefuse on the ground. "The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)provides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years" and they"cried to the Lord for help" Judges 4:3. In response to thoseprayers: "The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army bythe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. "Judges 4:15-16The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to thetent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safetyand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. Thesong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing ofthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it isthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. "Asyou did to Sisera ..."6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedienceThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:     "If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,     which are written in this book, and do not revere this     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. "     Deuteronomy 28:58-63The covenant God made with His people included curses fordisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms inan awesome account:"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loudvoice:"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thingdetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - andsets it up in secret. "Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" ""Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother..."Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone..."Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads..."Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, thefatherless or the widow..."Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly..."Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocentperson."Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law bycarrying them out.Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " Deut 27:14-26The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence ofrejecting Christ is the curse. "If anyone does not love theLord - a curse be on him. " 1 Corinthians 16:22(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-31; 12:14-29.)7. How can we preach these prayers?The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass onthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can weexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that thetroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish thestrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does nothear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Himonto the battlefield?Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church'sCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose jobis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certainand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders.The pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of acourier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcherto decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy.When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preachingmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God'srule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace onany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejectedit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But wemust consider what He said they should do if their message wererejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion againstGod's rule - "But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, gointo its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town thatsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:The kingdom of God is near"' Luke 10:11.What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, itwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sentfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for thattown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the greatauthority He had given them: "He who listens to you listens toMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejectshim who sent Me " (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis torcalling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellionagainst God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry ofHis servants.We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of thePrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from itslethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass onthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the rankswill be inevitable.Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings ofobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth isthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall hereap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience inDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenantbreakers is real.The "I" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The "we" of the Psalmsincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not ourown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. ThePsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They recordChrist's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. AsChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the finalfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God willanswer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on thefinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day whenHe will say: "But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to beKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me"Luke 19:27.A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and toobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these warpsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God'skingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome bythe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each localcongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally yourbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including "the swordof the Spirit, which is the Word of God " Eph 6:17. That battle-readiness also involves "pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasionswith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of theenemies of God as the psalmist did: "Pour out Your wrath on thenations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do notcall on Your Name" Ps 79:6.To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world itis necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who arepersecuted need the comfort of these prayers."Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May thepraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword intheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishmenton the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobleswith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written againstthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. " Ps149:5-9Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer forconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgementon those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the armyof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that Hehas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the peoplenf God to destroy evil.If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting orundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your swordanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory ofJesus - until "the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth asthe waters cover the sea" Hab 2:14.The full book "War Psalms of the Prince of Peace " is available,at R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.PERMISSION TO REPRODUCEThose wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of FF Newsare encouraged to do so.

A "quicklook" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Havingstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at onestage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlyingtheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.The clash between Jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily inthe theological realm. The "false prophets" understood their relatioshipto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It ispossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David'sdescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the partof the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to neverallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not aJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerlybeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from thetheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israelthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenantafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of thelocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaiccovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiahspoke his prophesies. The "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded withtheological meaning.In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson"New York will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestictheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.--                                                                     ___Bill Rea                                                            (o o)-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz || University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz || Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

His ultimate will (the reconcilication of allhumankind) will never be stopped.Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description ofthis process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God'sintentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full lifeand perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, anddeviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3)Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in theCross, as Jesus willingly ("not my will, Lord, but yours") died forthe redemption of all humankind.

I have noproblems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scripturessays:  Be perfect, even as your Father Who is in Heaven; that we can beco-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him. Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God. If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God. But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods. [I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself.  Thewhole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinctionwithin God that relationship is possible.  This implies some sort ofcommunication.  I assume that in their "native" form, the Father andSon are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn'tinvolved.  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son, i.e.  the Logosmade flesh.  When he's in a human form, his human actions are limitedto human capabilities.  So communication with the Father takes theform of prayer.  I don't see that there's anything problematical aboutthat.  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.--clh]

Where did Jesus say that the "Law" onlyapplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the "Law"?>The issue that the Church had to>face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to>follow Christ.

Why botherwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has tosay?>Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you afollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying thatthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?>As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did>continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they>continued to obey the Law.How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?>The issue was (and is) with Gentile>Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the>ceremonial aspects of it).Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Whosays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?>Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that>Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is thisreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting ratherlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you everconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter whatyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts ofJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?>He did interact with>Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a>couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke>7) suggest that he was a "God-fearer", i.e. a Gentile who followed>God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.>He was commended by>Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.>This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view>that Gentiles need not accept the Law.Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indicationsthat you can deduce from the Bible?

Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?Are you Christian or Pauline?>Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone>agrees with my reading.You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul.

He is quite>concerned about maintaining moral standards.You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?....Are you Christian or Pauline?[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what isnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly withthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why Ihave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studiesof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can'tcome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, variousChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and inother newsgroups.Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say thatit applies to Gentiles.And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on theSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you'relooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it'sunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However wedo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesusdealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealtwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't seethat there's a big problem.--clh]

The Woman is theChurch.  Catholics have always called our Church "Holy Mother Church"and our "Mother."  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, whowrote in 251 AD, "Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not havethe Church for his mother?"Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup,which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of HisBlood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shedfor you and for many." (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenantand holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holdingboth and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that theCatholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughoutthe world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the bloodof redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which theHoly Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all thenations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, "From the rising of thesun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywherethere is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation,for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts."  Andso we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote "For as often as you eat thisbread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes." (1Corinthians 11.26)You are quite right about the identification of "Babylon the Great,Mother of all Harlots" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to whattime period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.Andy Byler

Please take no offense at thesecomparisons.The homosexual "feels" things that I admit I do not "feel". He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelingsand learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply tohis feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences.That is, this model gives him a sense of understanding hissituation. Models that do not match up with what he knows hefeels will be discarded. However, one wonders if once acceptingthe idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly thatmeans he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on the definition he has already accepted, which of course validateshis model.If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.The Christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does notfeel. The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the truedescription of what his feelings mean. Once accepting thismodel he interprets his experiences with regards to this modelwhich of course validates his Christianity.As a reminder, I am a Christian, a Catholic, I don't hate homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understandthem. I only compare them because they are both so foreignto me. Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seemsblind to me? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial ofreligious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against attempts by society to deny his sexuality?Or am I just out to lunch, again?Chris Mussack

No: reasonable alternative exists.I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must bean answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.I have always wondered why Christians use the "There are questionsscience (or atheism) cannot answer" argument; I hope this is theappropriate group to ask this question.The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does theuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?and2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,is it a meaningful question, after all?I would say it isn't. Consider the following:A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubtone's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -can I ever be sure I exist?However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someoneinsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would bepointless - the being would exist anyway.Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does notexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This beingis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but letus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivitypostulate). The question "why anything exists" can be countered bydemanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness,or in non-existence". Actually, both questions turn out to bedevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't existdon't exist. Tautology at its best.I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God isHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with thisanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God isactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us andthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does GodHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, alwaysexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapableof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do notaccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt thequestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists havesuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emergefrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recentHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are moreappropriate for discussions like this. : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isn't: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how",not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why"questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that thesupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it isas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. : I believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems aresomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christiansin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announcethey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolutioncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, althoughtheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent bookSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. JonathanCape, London 1992.Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do notviolate any physical laws as we know them. : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you: really have nothing to worry about, eh?Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelicalatheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I wouldnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife.Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org

DeYoungW. Petersen     More recently Wright's understanding has itself been questioned from adifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguisticconfusion in using the English word "homosexuals" as the meaning ofarsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions forrendering it by "homosexuals" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into asingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds"homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  "Amajor disjunction" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and thethought and terminolgy in Paul's time (187-88).      What is this "disjunction"?  He bases it on historical and linguisticfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality aspolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. Virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. Christianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" indescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of"homosexuals" and "heterosexuals," and assumed that, in the words of Doverquoted approvingly by Petersen, "everyone responds at different times to bothhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ." (188). [23]      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term "homosexual"to desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German termequivalent to "homosexual," used it as referring to orientation, impluse oraffectional preference and having "nothing to do with sexual acts" (189).     Petersen then proceeds to cite the "Supplement to the Oxford EnglishDictionary,"  which defines "homosexual" only as a propensity or desire with nomention of acts.  Petersen's point is that by using "homosexuals" forarsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history"where no equivalent concept existed" (189).  Consequently the translation isinaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludesheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includesfemale homosexuals" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no "cognitive structure,either inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation ofhumanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence" (189).     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio"homosexual" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the onemistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The nextphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position.                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING                          ARSENOKOITAI BY "HOMOSEXUALS"Historical Grounds     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitaiby "homosexuals" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Sincevirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul'susage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writingreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporarywith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived ofhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar topresent-day concepts.       Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexualcondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot bepart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the termis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; Scroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancienttimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither ofthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postionfirst with the former one being addressed below under "Linguistic Grounds."     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not thehomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet ifit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always includingancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. Indeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not onlyknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms ofsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sexorientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in"Symposium" (189d-192d) may be a "sole possible exception" to ancientingnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that evenhere "acts appear to be the deciding factor."  However, this is a verysignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called "an exception," because ofthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.     THe "Symposium" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence forknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sexcomprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman"). Hence "original nature"palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced thesehuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to thegods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of theopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are     woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as     their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be    clasped in men's embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come    to man's estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the     willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort-     happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously     thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be     induced to leave each other's side for a single moment.  These are    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for aslong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each "wouldunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for allthe time:  (192e).     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism iscontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  "Natural interest" (tonnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. The words, "born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: (paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims "tobe born this," i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity ("the two of themare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love," 192b) ispresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of "mutual love ingrained in mankindreassembling our early estate" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kaites archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency ("These arethey who continue together throughout life," 102c) is also present.  Furthermention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, "gay pride," pederasty,homophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works isrecognizable.    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart fromactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality iscrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). They mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are towkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion"(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or "matters" of love (187c), thedesires of love (192c) and being "males by nature" (193c).  Noteworthy is thespeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire isrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for "what is notprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack."  This isthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between "whatsort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e).  This ancientphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition ofbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love andhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in errorwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, notinclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports thelatter. [27]     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts wherehomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  InRom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desiresof the heart." and "reprobate mind" prove Paul's concern for disposition andinclination along with the "doing" or "working" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). Even the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor6:9-11) by words describing what people "are" or "were," not what they "do." Habits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives riseto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparentlywas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,people of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only afew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,Seneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces anadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes tosome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where hejustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchangeof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the"new labels" of "natural" and "unnatural" for sexual behavior.  These did notbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and evennon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,Plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]Linguistic Groundsfootnotes___________________________22  W.L. Petersen, "Can ARSENOKOITAI Be Translated by 'Homosexuals'? (I Cor6:9; I Tim 1:10)"  VC 40 (1986): 187-91.23 K.J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1.24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato's writings may not reflectAthenian society, or that the speakers in "Symposium" may not reflect Plato'sview.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover(Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below 25 The translation is that of W.R.M. Lamb, Plato:  Symposioum LCL (Cambridge:Harvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to "adulteress."  If there isa homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there mustalso be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to lovethe male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young; the latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent(181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered adisgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to thecowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of "homophobia"?).  In Athens itwas "more honorable to love openly than in secret" (182d -an ancient expressionof "coming out of the closet").  Mutality was present ("this compels lover andbeloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue," 184b).    For Petersen to label the Symposium a "possible" exception to his positionis inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greeksociety hundreds of years before the time of Christ.27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation inPlato's works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of thosewho "habituate themselves" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexualityhad become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement ofAlexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the "some men, from birth, fhave a naturalaversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do wellnot to marry" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian'sCodex of laws (it referes to those "who have been consumed by this disease" asin need of renouncing "there plague," as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  FinallyThucydides 2.45.2 has: "Great is you glory if you fall not below the standardwhich nature has set for your sex."     Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers(Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutualhomosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be eithergay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs(Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must haveexisted in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutualhomosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44).28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary onDeuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition ofcross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a "mere rule of conventional propriety." See also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144.29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuouscitizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as "against nature" (paraphosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH3:4-5 the sodomites changed the "order of nature."  THe Jewish writers, Philo(On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199;2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as "against nature."  Finally,, firstcentury moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke ofhomosexuality as "against nature."  Christians clearly did not invent thelabels "natural" and "unnatural".  See J.B. De Young, "The Meaning of 'Nature'in Romans 1 and Its Implications for Biblical Prosecriptions of HomosexualBehavior" JETS 31/4 (Dec 1988):429-41.

What sets a Messiah apart isthat he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect butachieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were bornsinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take Godthousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as Godoriginally intended.  God's restoration providence is still notcomplete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God'srepresentative on the earth, but not God himself.

Every time it arises, it causes| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.| Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren't Jews, so we| aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom4:15 notes that "where no law is, there is no transgression."  Not onlydid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before itwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promisewhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of thepeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised"what ever He says to do we will do."  That is why the new covenant isbased on "better promises" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the lawGod promised to "put my laws in their minds and write them on theirhearts" (Heb. 8:10).3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  TheSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempthad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have beeneven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weeklySabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur atany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, thecovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promisesbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being borninto Israel is not enough "For they are not all Israel, which are ofIsrael" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says "if ye be Christ's, then are yeAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."  All Christians areAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not thecriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on thepromise God made to all his people the Israelites.| | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.| | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments| into "moral" and "ceremonial".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians| are free to choose the specific time we worship.People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbathcommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates theceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Evenif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagansun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leadersagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions insoc.religion.christian.bible-study).| | A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral| guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc.| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same| function as, and have largely the same content as, the "moral law" in| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.| I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what Godsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is theSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was importantenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note thatthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law butfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then incourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives megrace, do I walk out of the court saying "I can now go on speeding, for Iam now under grace?"  Being under grace I now drive within the speedlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 "Di we then make void the law throughfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law."  "Wherefore the law isholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom. 7:12).| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's| resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also| implies gatherings on that day.| | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day| Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and| that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 showsthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul didnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot toAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate "lay by him in store"with "go to a worship service."| | It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See| Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly| mentions Sabbath.)Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbathday of the moral law.| | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word| "Sabbath".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated| for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship.| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians| support "blue laws", both in secular law and church law, setting aside| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the| Lord's Day.| Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different argumentswhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from aGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law couldnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of abroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for lawbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not tofollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin tomake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, tokill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weightwhen placed next to the word of God.Darius[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  Ithink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) isprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doingwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equallyaccept that those who "esteem all days alike" are similarly doingtheir best to honor the Lord.However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguousproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As Iindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actuallyabout something else.  They both look like they are talking aboutnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says "and theygathered every Sunday for worship".  We get various pieces ofinformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish templeworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously thetemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example ofChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell uswhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see noreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when theBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies tome that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered tosee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicitenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It saysthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul'scollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered speciallyto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would bewhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to doit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.So I think the most obvious reading of this is that "on the first dayof every week" simply means every time they gather for worship.  I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statementsis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christianworship was.--clh]

While the originalfundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think mostpeople who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole originalagenda.  (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  thevirgin birth.)  The term is now being used by the press to describeaggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those whoare attempting to legislate religion.Legalism is yet another ill-defined term.  However there is somereason for its use in this context.  In fact the common theologicaldefinition is the believe that salvation is through the Law.  I hopeno one here believes that our conservative contributors hold thisview.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what weexpect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects tofind specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating thisapproach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God'sLaw.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but itregards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon theculture and other things.  It's easy to see why a liberal would regardthe conservative approach as legalism.  It's hard to know quite whatother term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, becauseno one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the questionis whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling thepositive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I haven'tseen any good alternative.--clh]

In fact, I've heardpeople refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times. It's a commonfigure of speech. Considering that Elizabeth was just another human, I thinkthis passage offers nothing towards justifying the "blessedness" of Mary.

She saidthat when she and my father were raising we four children, theydid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raisedin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would bealienated from them and it would create problems.  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. Theyraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonabledemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics andnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of Godnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept thatI may someday be held responsible for the things that offendedHim...sins that the "world" told me were OK.  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raisedfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a morecomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justiceand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, manygrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was marriedand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope forchange...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )and more....  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowingus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and byaccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement orcounsel.  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help soulsbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular anddifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be ableto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love andcompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may notwant to hear and will stay away from you.  This life is "but dust". As long as the comfort of this lifeis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail thosewith whom we come in contact.  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, whosupport the "right" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful inthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, lovingfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me thatwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around meliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decentpeople. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)It is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayerlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.Think about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you thata friend is in error, but you don't want to "cause trouble".Righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we arewe are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid tosimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say afervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.In more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother'skeeper.In Jesus and Mary,Elizabeth

The founder of thismovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scripturesof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility andextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslimshas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The UnitedNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty Internationaland top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to themembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around theworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-tural backgrounds.        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towardsdeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslimshave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-gious intolerance and fundamentalism.        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinicsin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed byvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement'sinternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number ofprofessionals as well as world class individuals.        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moralreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind underone universal brotherhood.NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than"NO/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created.

He has no objection to  use his workstationfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of thenewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral thirdparty.QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:=====================        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroupmay be sent to:     Nabeel A.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who isalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)I've been working at this company for eight years in variousengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized thaton seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at thiscompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- itcould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.There was no note.  I do not know if it was:- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry- someone's sick idea of flirting- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to askme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a militaryspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and outfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have aBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up toCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy LoveAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in theoffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into mybriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home tofind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someonewants to do to my body.To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday totreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour forleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to goto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever singleperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No onecould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though mynumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like aneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despitethe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman beingleft in my desk drawer.I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply woundedthat it's ridiculous.I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people toreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feellike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simplephone call saying "We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early sothat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting..."Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculouslyturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturingme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please prayfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of awhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new jobin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent suchharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly actsappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (Thiscompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassmentisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that onefemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene orthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seventimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the companydo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.That's my bad habit: "ignore it and it will go away", "you're not worthanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this", "you're right,you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated thisway", "you are just an object", "you prostitute your mind to thiscompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there aswell?", "what makes you think women aren't just possessions, andnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?"This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a majordepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come intomy head and stay there, triggering depression.Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection toGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that canseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from hisloving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of thehand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holdingon to me.)Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For thisreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.

Indeed, asmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap thatChristians must always be wary about.

A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone. >So, I think that your position is:>The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our >interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out >what that truth is.>Did I get that right?Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as falliblehuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The distinction is subtle yet important.When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his resultsare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever couldhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,without sacrificing his convictions.Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can knowwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in theright direction when he uttered, "Cogito, ergo sum," yet we have not advancedmuch beyond that.Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe thatthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutelycertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,you have no such assurance.

The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions aboutabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability that they are wrong.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.  It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found, that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course, if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions and begin to resent you.I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I knowthat the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing.I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am notoffended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations withsome Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but forthose at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere,the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context>should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander>-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.The story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity to "know" the two men who were Lot's guests; the fact that the Sodomites became angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they were interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was rape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as sinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it was that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended rape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible alternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.You seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to "stigmatize" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not supposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning.  If God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises *any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.>>"...

And such >were >>some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11.> >The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_>in this.  The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church as the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be legitimate, and thus the church's refusal to recognize "perverted" marriages was circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the church ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a straw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise definition/translation of "porneia" isn't really important, unless you are trying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex.  I'm not sure the moderator was trying to do that.In any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  When Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, "Have you not read, that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." (Mt. 19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife (female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, and not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this union, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men.This is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word.  I read in the Bible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there have been uninspired men who have ordained "alternative" unions (isn't Caligula reported to have "married" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to as "what God has joined together" is the heterosexual union of a man and his wife.(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that's probably inflammatory, and I should save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply.)Anyway, my original question was not whether we should translate "porneia" in a way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as divinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and other sins) are really wrong:>>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of>activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or>"reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may>or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very>fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at>all "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest>in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,>with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated>Christian discussion of ALL these areas.Alternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as "porneia" and all the rest was, in Paul's day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the "tutor" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen centuries drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  Perhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what "porneia" &c were because after 1600 years he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the reason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining a distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  I'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just wanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about sexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for practicing homosexuality!>Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I>know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and>child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly>"harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -->that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter>you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that>you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]> >        "'I am free to do anything,' you say.

[1 Cor. 6:12]> >Which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God.  A>commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some>people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.>It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary>argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such>behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.And how do you define an "obsessively driven" mode of sexual behavior?  How do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drives?  Is the desire to have "sinful" sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined as sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful.  Or is it obsessive because it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that's circular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even though society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is obsessive.You seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of "porneia" to only "perverted" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define "perverted" without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What, then, is Paul condemning when he declares that "Fornicators...shall not enter the kindgom of heaven"?>I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.>Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your>assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.I think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some technical definition of "porneia", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.>There are plenty of>laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of>which Christians ignore completely.

Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this would show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual law?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual behavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that God's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to just the ritual law and those who are under the Law?I've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the subject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to rest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on the Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements such as "Thou shalt not kill", and requirements that are merely part of the (temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse as "an abomination" is *just* a part of the temporary, Jews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those guilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here's why:Back in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in the possession of "the Amorite"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think?  But in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because "the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete".Remember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the iniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his being cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 again.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, "Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the nations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people."Notice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of Moses) are about to be punished because they have "defiled" themselves and their land by committing "abominations" that include incest, bestiality, and homosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these same "abominations" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on anyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man "lying with another man as one lies with a woman" (Lv. 20:13).  Their "bloodguiltiness" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to die for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even "the alien [non-Jew] who sojourns among you" was to refrain from these practices, on penalty of being "cut off [by God?] from among their people."Under the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not the homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the Canaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay sex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.>For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can>be "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)>it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to>determine why you "pick" one and ignore another.According to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can learn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is a violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law (for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I conclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a person is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case of homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the Law as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not obligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.(continued in Part 2)- Mark

Basically, what I think I've observed is that the phrase "the Ten Commandments", as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. 20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase "the Ten Commandments" should more accurately be translated "the Ten Discourses", of which the passage we call the "Ten Commandments" is really only the first.I'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I was sure.Arguments supporting the above idea:1)  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  In order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can't violate verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with only Nine "Commandments".  I could go on at length about this, but for now I'll just stop with this summary.2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginningof the traditional "Ten Commandments") and Ex 31:18 (where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; 25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; 31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase, "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying..."  The exception is Ex. 21:1, which begins "Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them..."3)  The word translated "commandments" in the phrase "the Ten Commandments" isn't really the word for "commandment", its the word for a speech, or an utterance.  It's a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements; for instance, when combined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is translated "Chronicles" in such phrases as "now the rest of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the Chronicles of x?..."  The word for "commandment" is freely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's, he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command.4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the stone tablets "with the law and the commandments" (Ex 24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the Ten Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not immediately clear why God would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to Moses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that God would not give Moses the tablets until He had finished delivering all Ten Discourses.5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both tablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If these Ten "Commandments" were only the first 17 verses of Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE letters!  Not that He couldn't have, of course, but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-sized letters.6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out the "commandments written on stone" as being the "ministry of death", "that which is fading away," and "the ministry of condemnation."  With the possible exception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in Ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, "fading away"-type commandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.Arguments against this idea:The main argument against this idea, aside from the fact that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that in Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in Ex. 20:1-17, "These words the LORD spoke...and He added no more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me."  This appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets.That was my first impression, anyway.  However, after some thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase "These words."  If Moses meant "These words *which I have just related to you* were spoken by God" etc., then that would mean that only the traditional "Ten Commandments" were on the stone tablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical comment--"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were spoken by God" etc.--then that's quite different.I did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the people asking Moses to represent them before God, whereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of Moses between the first and second discourses, several days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This reinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt 5:22ff were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a strictly chronological account of when God wrote what, and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the tablets.Summary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses of God.  I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before; it's brand-new to me.  So, while I lean towards accepting it, I would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer.- Mark

For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitionspassed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception".So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over andover in her mind so as not to forget it before she told thepriest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, thepriest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know whatyou are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactlyit meant but she was just too happy to have the answer forthe priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you rememberthis if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly thatshe had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on herway to the priest...The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer whichthe priest finally observed and took as proof of an authenticpersonal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.(Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water whichour lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with herbare hands in front of pilgrims.

Up until I was 14, it wasn't an issue for me. Then I meta born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not imposing. I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I 'should'.But the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of myown personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict.until I was 23.Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point,then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist. This is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. I am very anti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists aredepraved.)Religion has no place in my system.Tough.Bertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove it. So, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. But, for all practicalpurposes there is no god.Thanqs ken engelkene@acs.bu.edu

Iguess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at thischurch.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I alsounderstand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming isperceived to approach.There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at anycost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits intothis equation?Baptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springstold they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religiousrite.By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern BureauColorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured toa church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by aBaptist minister.Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied bytheir parents, thought they were going to a carnival at theCornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,free balloons, squirt guns and candy.Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whiskedinto a room for religious instruction and told they should bebaptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or theirfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, includingPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girlswho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's afalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the ministertold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were notbaptized.Cornerstone church officials defended their actions.'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commandedus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Biblewhere it says that parental permission is required before a child isbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone BaptistChurch.Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptizedbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their childrento a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who weremembers of the Cornerstone Church.Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing thechildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.-------------------------------------------Aren't these the same behaviors we condemnin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper accountmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent isabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because ofthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insistedon being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willingto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrantmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so muchparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether youbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the signof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part ofthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it islikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is froma baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, hewould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he alreadyhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he getrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's beingrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.--clh]

God deserves our love and worship because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting Christ.  I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are afraid of going to Hell?

And these will pay the penalty ofeternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory ofHis power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to bemarveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you wasbelieved.Things to note from this passage.  Unbelievers are both those who openly rejectthe gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the sameas the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it isseparation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd adventwhile 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Don't confuse the two. >>In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of>hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment.Yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.

Anyway...)The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption ofMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout theirministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 werepresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several dayslater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several ofthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal wasstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  Therewas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything elsewas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believedthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behindby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by theapostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written downin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that theauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case ofthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.Hope this helps--I would welcome anyone who has more information toadd to what I've said.- Mike Walker  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu  (Univ. of Illinois)  ]

The Roman Empirelasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  Themain reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople bythe men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had beenexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian cityof Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle ofMazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matterof time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold ontothe rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middleshould be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack ofConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greekshad wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with theCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rdCrusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people theyconsidered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for thecause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkishhordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the somehordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third ofEurope (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)Andy Byler

In this skillful, careful treatment of an explosive subject, Hanegraaff documents and examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian faith. For the first time ever, this large and influential movementis legitimately labeled as cultic.In this book, Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith movement as E.W. Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of "another gospel" (Gal 1:6-9) (Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, FrederickK.C. Price, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Paul (David) Yonggi Cho, Charles Capps, Jerry Savelle, Morris Cerullo, and Paul and Jan Crouch).The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and shouldbe in most Christian Book Stores soon. You can order a hard-back copy through CRI for $14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail mark-ups.The Christian Research Journal, which is a quarterly publication by CRI has an article in it's most recent issue just released called, "What's Wrong With The Word Faith Movement?" This is a good article that will inform you of each of the teachers above, and tide you over until your book arrives. If you are interested in receiving the Journal yourself, you can order it from CRI at the number above for $14 a year. It is the best source of the most-accurate and well-researched info in Christiandom today.[If we're going to have a discussion of book here (and this is thethird posting so far), I'd like people to say enough about itscontents for people to decide whether it's worth reading.  --clh]

If we unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with Christianity and reject what isn't.    We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and service.

The reasoning was that congregationsare free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessionschoose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, theywere not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could notbe forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the partof the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150thAnnivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that veryissue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womensordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, allministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  Intheory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, orrefused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could bedisciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it isunlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation wasa mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislationworked very well.  We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next yearsassembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing ofsame-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel onDoctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year -the matter will be considered and debated then.Hope this is interestingAlison

You seem to wish fora greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestantthought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid.To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestantthought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significantaspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently tryto embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, thereis not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) showvery nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theologicalissues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity.Thus, for example, as you go on to say:>                                                        They should>remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I,Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (asopposed to political) significance.

The "unbelieving"Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosenpeople of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation.I think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should notbe over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don'thave more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily fromthe background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarshipsuggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingeringquestion, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basisof the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby "made the handsunclean" when used.  The list of "sacred books" that may be drawn up fromJosephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book,if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh.All of this is not to "throw out" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way,is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-))-- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgmentdoes not do it justice.>>Andy Byler-- Michael L.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross ThatSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make noreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim ofresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed whatthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (PublCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paulhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again thereis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,no ascension either.Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in thegrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our textsuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming upwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no textsbefore this which mention the tomb).     > > Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as thefoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.randy

DeYoung                               Professor of New Testament                         Western Conservative Baptist Seminary                                      Portland, Oregon     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 Cor 6:9and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to "active maleprostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,namely "homosexuals."  More recently the definition "homosexual" has beenopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term"homosexuals" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditionalrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludesheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the onlyfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation ofarsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving itfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientationand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).                      *************************************                                   INTRODUCTION     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years hasbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality orsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, usedtwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorousscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society sinceso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the churchand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey andevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidenceto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent themodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, haveprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wideracceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in theministry.

With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (asbest as a non-repeatable event can be "proven").  But I ask, what holds  someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by faith?[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.

Actually, both questions turn out to be= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist= don't exist. Tautology at its best.Carefully examine the original question, and then the "counter-question". The first asks "Why", while the second is a request for definition.  It doesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, forhow do we identify something as "nothing" (aren't they mutually exclusiveterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this isnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and Iwould appreciate an explanation). I might add, the worldview of "Things that exist do, and things thatdon't...don't" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,as does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumptionthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its veryfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* areason.We come to this. Either "I am, therefore I am.", or "I am for a reason."If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you aresatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is justbeginning.  = I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.Time will tell. 8^)= = Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is= Himself the existence.

This is pantheism, not Christianity.Agreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity aswell.= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe inwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  Iseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of theCreator.I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer "why".   Itappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool isinadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Assertingthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".

Those who subscribe to_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someonecomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but thecontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy adsis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on thefamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds thatNefertiti was "a beautiful black queen."  This set off an exchange ofhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they hadan article from an Egyptologist titled "Was Cleopatra Black?"  (The answerto the title is "no"-- she was greek.)I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  Ipersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine inWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations varyenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with darkhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up anddown the Mediterranean.(Also, if what I remember is correct, the "Black Madonna" doesn't representa person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  JoeBuehler....?)In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget thatgreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How aboutthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And thenthere are the Ethiopians....Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of thesepeople are "white" (i.e., of the racist's "race").  If I may risk apotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be theidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Consideringthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medievalantisemitism on the other, I don't think that this "Jesus was white" thesisever played the roles that some hold it did.Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seemsawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.-- C.

Don't forget that Jesus was seen by boththe Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He wasburied begs the question.Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think onthis a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'mnot talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth, but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking aboutdying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know tobe a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the body seems rather lightweight to me.As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this isan argument that can be discounted.That leaves you back on square one.

If you want the full document, ask me by mail--Rex]    "Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His innerconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake anyessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with theattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This wouldmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realmof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that whichwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that thedivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,not in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a humannature.     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and thehuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to theperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,omniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limitedpower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  Thereis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no moreshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essentialperfection of the Godhead.     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to thepossession of the double natures.  Christ's human nature is impersonal, in thatit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of theGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of theMan. Nature is defined:"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamentalcharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate andunchangeable."     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as suchthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. Personality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with thepower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human natureof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal. LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equallyimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, assuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably saythat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It istheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself thehuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the willare simply human or simply divine."[The quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirelyclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classicChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That's the position thatChrist's two natures were not complete, in that there was only onewill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was thehuman will that was regarded as missing.Normally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being"impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, theyare using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense ofpersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia".Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way ofdenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has neverbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influentialtheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But thequotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,into the realm of the overtly heretical.--clh]

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdictionand authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying thatPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basicallystood by the Pope.It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter isdisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also overauthority and discipline.  My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX  don't jointly make such  choice.)If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.If I adopt the view that "I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, andthere's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours", thatI've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdictionviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in EcumenicalCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation ofthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going intothe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree thata split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic gameslike "He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he doesis effective...".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.>So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak>Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?

If not, howdo you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,one way or the other.>Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate>command).

Obviously, if a "truth" is not always "true" then we have a>> contradiction in terms.  I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, awaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.For example, I recently was asking some children the question "What temperaturedoes water boil at?"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I askedif they knew what scale, and was told "It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.That's what all thermometers say."  Well, that's sincere, and may betrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOTan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we shouldnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truthand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the timeand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religioneasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO. [example of head-covering in Church deleted]This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind thewriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that theinstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of firstcentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was havinga LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be. >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)>Can you reconcile this?Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse "blessed is he who takes yourbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks" literally.

And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since Iknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.>>> >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical >> >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding >> >Biblical interpretation.>> >> So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate >> the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through whichGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there AREabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that theoriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that theylive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or thatcafeteria for lunch?  No.  This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christiansare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an innerreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simplyappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few        adults respond to this treatment.Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com)-- -------Lawrence OverackerShell Oil Company, Information Center    Houston, TX            (713) 245-2965llo@shell.com

Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:In procuring the common good of society the need could arisethat the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannotcause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties,including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similarreasons, legimate authorities have the right to impedeaggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church's traditional teaching has always been expressed and will continue to be expressed in the consideration of the real conditions of common good and theeffective means for preserving public order and personalsafety.  To the degree that means other than the deathpenalty and military operations are sufficient to keep thepeace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferredbecause they are more in proportion and in keeping with thefinal goal of protection of peace and human dignity.  As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capitalpunishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in totalaccord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadlyforce in those cases for which this option is justifiable.  >I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken>as support for capital punishment.

Many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly "Johannine Hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each month. A "Johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given Bible passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own life-journey.The idea of "Johannine hours" was born in Taize as a simple responseto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in themidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is oftenimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, buteveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sitquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice ofChrist.During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.Perhaps those who read and think about the "Johannine Hours" in thisnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, thepersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspectof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:=================================The following provides some background information on the life andvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community."A PARABLE OF COMMUNION": August 1940, with Europe in the grip ofWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almostabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bringtogether a monastic community which would live out "a parable ofcommunity", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress ofthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to concealrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent thefirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,seven brothers committed themselves together to common life andcelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, eachone making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestantbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them areliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, Northand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts forthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds nocapital. The brothers earn their living and share with othersentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, aninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to livein the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcomingpeople in Taize.TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, andless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond havethus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinentalmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the yearand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during anyone week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explorethe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the innerlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers andeverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Churchof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became toosmall."A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH" The community has never wanted tocreate a "movement" around itself. Instead, people are called tocommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has createdwhat it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". At the end of eachyear, the pilgrimage has a "European meeting" which brings togethertens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe forseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asiaand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an openletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of thepoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languagesand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.NOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in        news.groups.For any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk               brother.roy@almac.co.uk--  . 1st 1.10b #332 .

This is basicallya share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powersof any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the NewTestament speaks of.What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifyinggrace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means bywhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusionfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for ahuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifyinggrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock andattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neithercan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, sinceboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannotenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or theycannot enter into Heaven.Turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for theCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes somechange in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist onthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by theApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortlythereafter.There is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1Cor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known forsure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as aninfant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of hismartyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized asinfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus's "AgainstHeresies", and in Tertullian's "On Baptism".  All these so farmentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord's death.  Afterthat, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.

The True Celebration is Easter,the Resurrection of Our Lord.  This has been true from the foundationof the world.  Pagan practices are then either:1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection,    in which dim light was shone forth so that people would   recognize the full truth when it was manifested, OR2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not   recognize the truth when it was manifested.I don't believe the second argument, because I believe in the powerof the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope.Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images ofthe truth of the Resurrection.  As Paul states, we see through a glassdarkly.  So do others.  It serves no purpose arguing about who hasthe darker or lighter glass.  The foreshadowings are not perfect.So what?

Lauderdale, FLLines: 56Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.eduThe Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of thesisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris.Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promisedthe Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared toher and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertainingto her life and to the future of France and the world.On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructedher to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and wouldreceive great graces. In less than a year there were three moreapparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reportswere received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuingthe medal was known as the "Miraculous Medal". Catherine died in 1876.Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She wascanonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at themotherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting withOur Lady.The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothedin white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowingwisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globeand there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she wasstepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped inpiercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The swordrepresented her suffering with Jesus.The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarnedthat a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets.And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide disputewith the forces of the dark. She told Catherine "The times areevil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will beoverturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of allkinds."Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages.A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.I will post other Marian events every few days or so includingthe ones happening today which are still under investigation.These postings serve only to introduce you to these events.Please look more into them and understand the reason for the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: My opinions.

Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes. You have to be very careful about what you mean by "question authority".Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,and to say "I question to word of this authority" is ridiculous. If it is open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectlyreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrasehere should be "authenticate authority." Once you have authenticatedyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it asan authority. The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistencyin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules ofdiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, ininself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need whichI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I mustdo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don'thave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientistworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sortsof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself.In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I ama Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seemthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter forbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is areasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility ofevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possiblychange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to denyGod's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their verynature, prove anything.-- ==============================================================================Mark Baker                  | "The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts." -- C.

This passage is *not* a mother image of God at all. The mother hereis the image of the best human constancy can show, and it is contrasted with the constancy of God.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  familiesconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begottenof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate andwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfectman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\nu o  \\upsilon \\zeta $); He  was crucified,died, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to theHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of allcreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested theChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of Hisglory, according to the Scriptures.2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism ofTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say thatChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God andby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by natureGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite byuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, whichHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,which He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural willand energy.4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^are united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^without  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^thought alone.^^^^^^^^^^^^^5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasisof the Logos Incarnate.[...]I guess that adresses your question adequately.As for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to thediscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not seehow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start anendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a briefanswer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church regarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.Peace,Nabil          .-------------------------------------------------------------.         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /    '-------------------------------------------------------------'

A generationbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,gateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way ratherthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which wouldhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored theirdecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from theland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, anddestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by thetime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderershad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with asigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when theywere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.Whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleachedbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression ofhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nationat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. Theforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, thosewho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take theinheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Mosesprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.All these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complainingpeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; buthe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem wasthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. "Who is yourGod?" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. WhenAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or youngbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bullwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He ledIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles growthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and watergushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, theGod of Almightiness becomes "ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?"And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He mightbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a rightto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these peoplehad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hungon the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believedGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIMand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, Hisacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From theday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.At Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. Hehad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. Thisrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's gloriousPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion andlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word "lovingkindness" is not to beunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationshiparising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as thelove that says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Lovingkindness is astenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in itsheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based onfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotionthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek ourhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. Goddoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelingsof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love withus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Himto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- notbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committedto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He willnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It issaying to the recipient, "For as long as we shall live, I am for you."  The Godwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--inHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who islovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will neverleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him aslove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeingmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in theheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.Moses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had forthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, theycould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born outof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One whogives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is tomiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  Ifman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend onknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues fromlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years ofmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come toknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and thepossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. Thelanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in itsmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It iswaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we wereto ask, "What has the baby done to deserve this?" or, "Have arrangementsbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?" Ourquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child wasconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a lovethat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love isunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the childor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,spontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned afterHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of theLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do toearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identitythrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is ascientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, ifit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has beenheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without theembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the newgeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence inthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy andgladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with Hislove. "Satisfied." in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describingbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describethe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has receivedenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to bedrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is thelifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in ourdeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problemsdisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feelingthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which makesense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks thissatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of theemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it inreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is respondingto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of lifemake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise againbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find itfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of Hislove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one wouldthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, bythe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knewbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won'tfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use tomanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions andgive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyesand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking Godto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partiallyanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith whichworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in itsfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out thelove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,we read of the Holy Spirit "falling upon" the believers. This is an ancientexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used inLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and "falling on hisneck and kissing him." The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepestself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of yourbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realizationthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taughtus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in astate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptanceand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive lovewe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the HolySpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness tothink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jadedwith the doctrine of "perform to be accepted." We begin to realize that Heloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challengeeveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open youreyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may notfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed theother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians keptbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rayswithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowingthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according toMoses, "joy and gladness all our days." Joy is the result of a life that isfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might saythat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highestperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, andthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he nowhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,in joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.----- End Included Message -----

My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity.   I would think not.   Hate begets more hate, never love. ....   In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our    neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he    commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. ....   - ScottI too dislike the phrase "Hate the sin, love the sinner".  Maybe thedefinite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to giveus license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we havemanaged to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, orculture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.That said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip sideof this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes,Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  Inthe New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one shouldalways actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense,it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and itsvictims, even when these are its accomplices as well.Maybe "mourn sin, love sinners" catches the idea slightly better than"hate", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passivepowerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love,and carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  TheEuropean pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities wasdevoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love orgrief they exemplified.My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few yearsback, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died ofAIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, andabandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister andbrother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief overJack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callousbureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family,the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's ownlapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himselfshared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, hewas contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long beforehis AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack'sinnate sexual orientation, n.b.)Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.Van Kellyvek@research.att.com

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argumentfrom article length."  And the list you have here is of poorerquality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from anon-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem withverses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none whodenied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many ofthe contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls inone verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort ofcontradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in myexperience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount toanything more than attacking a straw man?Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes outof context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the onesthat are genuine contradictions need to have more said aboutthem than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effortshould be made to understand and respond to the common repliesgiven by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that DaveButler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list thatwould have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documentedcontradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken outof context and thrown together in a list.)Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together tomake a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us whowant to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thingas embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.djP.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The qualityis very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just acompilation of things many people have written), but some ofit would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, Imight be willing to help put it together.

It's use as prayer language seems especially troublingto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doingthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit isGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only goby the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.Moreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would thenassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, itis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see howGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then thatif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME oneamongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONEANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to justify jabbering.But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts atverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show thatthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outrightfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous postseems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a twosyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their "victories" (sincemost ailments "cured" are just plain unprovable) and modern dayressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that nomodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.

John Fife, visited ourchurch about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busyweek for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issueof homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting nextmonth.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that rangethe gamut from "outlawing" homosexuality altogether to "legalizing" itcompletely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficultissue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian churchsplit in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Withoutquestion, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunitedfor all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and ispushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortionissue last year as a solution.He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, themembers of the church "Agree to Disagree" on the issue, admitting thatboth sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit leadthem to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortionissue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful thatthe GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagreewith their own view.--Cliff Slaughterbeck           | Dept. of Physics, FM-15       |   It's time for the sermon on theUniversity of Washington      |   Grand Torino!Seattle, WA 98195             |[It's going to be hard to agree to disagree.  If we allowdisagreement, then some presbyteries and churches are going to ordainpeople that others will not recognize.  That's a difficult situationin a connectional church.  I could live with it, but I think a lot ofpeople would not be willing to.  Note that the church was not willingto live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women.  Theone thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming aPresbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don't acceptordination of women.  The argument is that we can't have half thechurch not accepting the leaders of the other half.  Maybe people willdecide to live with it in this case when they didn't in the other, butI wonder.  I admit that my own Presbytery submitted an overture to theGA that would have exactly this effect, and we considered theambiguity better than the current situation.  --clh]
