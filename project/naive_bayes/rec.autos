 19I'm looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984 Toyota Tercel.  Standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but every place I've gone to (Service Merchandise, etc.) doesn't have my car in its model application book.

Go to KMart and buy the> cleaner yourself for $1.29.This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which ishooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run onthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this ispricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solventitself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose tofit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however,a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for properinjector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the$59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment todo it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Scott Keller+1 314 537 6317    The Agricultural Group of Monsanto Company   sekell@bb1t.monsanto.com  KA0WCHpacket: ka0wch@k0pfx.mo.usa.na

 26I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20.In consumer reports it is ranked high in manycatagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).A couple of things though:1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this   car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's.2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully   loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match   up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993   version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.I guess my question is: Is this a good deal? Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?Thanks,Carl HoffmanP.S.The other cars that I have test driven and which are in therunning are:Mitsubishi Galant, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camary

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of aroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just havea weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedinglycold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a coldplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-visspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operatingtemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Rememberthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat andradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it orsomething.Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonizedoil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,stick to the 10W40.--DON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE!

Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to suefor pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X issome number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driverwas drunk)3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appealto regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this everhappening).You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you canstill sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limitedtort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole whotreats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. Inexchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save$150/year.Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confusepeople so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurancecompanies would be pushing harder for repeal.

 26This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed(front wheel drive included).Concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of carsin snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will performadequately in less than ideal conditions.An aside: I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have everdriven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of thesenext winter. Tim---Timothy J.

I explained that I wanted a car just like theone I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly likeI wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price andsigned the deal.Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglectedto take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurredover 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I wouldhave to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor theprice if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for 6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a goodexample of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's toobad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers wouldno longer be in business.  The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing thesalesman said was, "Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work outhow much profit I should make."  The deal went through with no problems.Steve

 20This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time.The "breeding" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at bestextremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should havethe power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is imminent.My Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back.The persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not beforehaving trashed the car.On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motelfor the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing mycar, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenantwalked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. Needless to say, I immediately packed-up and left.Watch out for car-jacking and staged accidents. They can be deadly!Steve Heracleous

Just a strutgoing down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with atension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by usingshorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shorteningthe strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometrywill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at theintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottomof the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restorethe suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spaceris the only way to go...--Ken-- Ken R.

 10I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except whenhaving a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot offreeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventativemaintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agentsthat can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in thesystem, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unlessyou are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just foryour info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 forflushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don'tknow if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.

If you're not after that sun beatingdown on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum andjetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with thewhooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't callit a convertible.And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my rollbar in a rollover situation.

I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next year (according to a WSJ article). Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described it as a "seriously handsome car with broad shoulders," I thought it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a Toyota Celica (yuch!).

AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is abetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.

Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While Ihaven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,(so they are similair.)

The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version ofthe 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Fordis spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which willpower most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probablydo not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the newCamaro/Firebird, IMO.  I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptationto "just get them out the door" for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really takes off.  Tim Gardner
 18Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'mnot talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that beganproduction in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from allmodels, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price rangeshould I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college rightnow, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a ride toschool, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory inthe spring/fall.

 8 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem. Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).
 35My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantiallyrestored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actualmileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in therestoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum andcompression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The bodyand undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly bya wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.Questions:Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the wayof braking action?It seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expectit to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weatherwas cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forevershrunk?Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once ownedan XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.

 22Nntp-Posting-Host: cs.dal.caHello,I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 HondaCivic Si.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were nottoo drastic.  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a newheader.  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would giveme?  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part.  Are thereany other comparines would make Honda parts.  Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won'tscrew up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make adifference.I don't really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that itwould be much harder on the engine.E-Mail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies.Thanks for any help you may have to offer!--Jeff Smithjsmith@cs.dal.caDalhousie UniversityHalifax, NS

 24Hello everyone,   I have an insurance question.Allstate insuranceSITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of exceeding repair costs.Person says "WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!" and takes it to another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the dealer.One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred in Pennsyvania.QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of thing. chris@camp.wpic.pitt.eduThanks...

Buying a car at "dealer's cost" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a kickback from the bank.Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself, try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.c. b. fowler  gtri/esmlchris.fowler@gtri.gatech.edu

Also look for chassis welded togetherhere.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger;a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and youcan even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshildwasher instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a goodbug/porsche mechanic would be easy.

 27Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the carshave this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobsthat aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clearcoated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) hasfine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed.When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I rememberfrom a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my carto the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed mycar.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof(which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean beforehe dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is ahaze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the lighthits the roof at a particular angle.I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any chance of getting the dealership to do something about this?My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that providesa solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect ofhaving the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?Information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .Scott "the-dealership-will-never-wash-my-car-again" Borderssborders@nyx.cs.du.eduborders_scott@tandem.com

 18I'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it.  Since I paidcash for the last car I bought I did not have to worry aboutwhether or not I had a good amount of insurance on it becauseof a bank loan.  I just put the amount that I wanted (not whata bank would have wanted).  Friends are telling me that banksrequire some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since itis collateral on loans.  Is this true?  Can that insurance begotten as part of my other insurance?  I assume I don't have topay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance.Am I correct?  I hear about accident/health type insurance atthe dealers and I am pretty sure these are just money makersfor them.  I just want to verify that I don't _have_ to buythese at all.  Or any other types of extras.What do I have to pay for?  Car, tax, license.  Anything else?Ellen

 11   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid NewCar Guide.  What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended'under the picture while a few sentences later noting how adriver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killedin a front end collision.  The most highly recommended smallcar (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the smallcars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicleswhere you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or issafety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

 82Howdy,I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of theknowledge and expertise available here.The Subject:  After-market cruise controlsThe Background:I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (myhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying todrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome ofa good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to doall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.My question:What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  Irealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going tobe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such athing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way ofaccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better thantrying to drive with a hosed ankle.I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine withkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--notelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just tryingto give information as completly as I can).I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buythis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so Iunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I readit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, butharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have asensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention Imight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Whichwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if itwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signaland a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signalfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'mnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, whatexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to getit?I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negativeside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground andall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a    device?2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?3.  Are "professionally" installed CCs signifacantly better and    worth the cabbage?4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple     needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,    the questions above)?My father and I built a "Veep" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was inhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, andcars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain thatI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit morecomplicated than my Veep. :-)I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate anyexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to sharesome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often(but I check my mail all the time).Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.Mike WiedaMikew@canc.byu.edu

Bowers)NNTP-Posting-Host: yfn.ysu.eduIn a previous article, gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W. Mahan) says:>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars isusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large carwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with apoorer Cd. To calculate drag use this formula:D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * SWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that thepieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). Note that power is:P = F * vWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and vis velocity (ft/s). Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D forforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in powerresult in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new topspeed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)101 mphSorry to dissappoint.-- Al Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA"Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?"                                             -Mary Chapin-Carpenter

 36  A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received. In short:     The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions   I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the   intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.   A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left   and gave me the ticket.     The officer said "The only reason that you even slowed down in the first   place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right   through"  I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine: PHGHGHGHGH.. The judge sided with me and decided that in this case "Not stopping" was the safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY.  The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very  slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made  the judge decide on his verdict.  Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case, go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for your benefit. Exercise your rights.

 28 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning theywould be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,wider and slightly banked. Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the southeast becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to theleft strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolledinto the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was thenthat I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not left the time he needed to dodge me.Rule: Just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,don't assume it will stay that way.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      TRAVIS disclamer: the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as                         my employer, since I have none |-)           e-mail, flame, at : marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the early 80's with thefuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuelwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileagethan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Bigmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The enginecould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems withthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --DON"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaperin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasolineengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as longand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline enginecosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injectionpump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,you never need a tune-up.If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.Good luck.

Most of the othermodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanesetechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic smallcars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since Ithink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japaneseroots.The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:Toyota PaseoHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol SiNissan NX1600/NX2000Mazda MX-3Isuzu ImpulseGeo StormFord Escort GTIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale andtrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedanplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higherprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:Tercel -> PaseoSentra -> NX1600/NX2000Civic -> del Sol323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)Stylus -> Impulse/StormTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts ataround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doorsoffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparablepowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: theIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a morefashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay moremoney for this type of car.  In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence "less" car, it's marketorientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalentsedan (SL1/SL2) version.I hope this clears things up a bit......Mihir Shah

 17You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawahas one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.-- MIKE HARKEROTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADAVOICE: 613-823-6757

 20Hello netters!I'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a ChevyBeretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore). They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that, 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot moreinsurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn'trent it from Alamo.Does anyone have some info on this?Is $225 a rip-off? Probability that I'll be needing more insurance?Is the beretta a good rental car?ThanxMarkus

Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestictransport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods werecrucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plentyof good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidlyexpanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of thefirst auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two goodbooks on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on theRoad" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The DevilWagon in God's Country" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  orJohn Bell Rae's auto histories.As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the earlyteens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheelon the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on theright, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tillerinstead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though Idon't know why.Dandh3q@andrew.cmu.eduCarnegie Mellon UniversityApplied History"World history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe, whether wecan comprehend and prove it or not."

I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireablethan the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM isbarely catching up, but they have more room for improvement thatcan only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly linewith screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still comewith the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they'regetting better and making the move in the right direction.They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really onlyin words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until theend of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most partsince there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn'tpress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.I do not put much stock in the mag rags' "inside" information, or evenFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it wasfinally disclosed in it's entirety.  "Inside" information had theTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't lookfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourselfif you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a newcar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has beenbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Thosemodular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE andcompetition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.Highly.The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attractsway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritageis more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself andbelieve Ford will forfeit that.I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicitdefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,intelligent, critical spews like, "The Mustang bites, man!"  Some ofyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camarowill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that thedifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain itscab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro stillreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal tothe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, whilethe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will beno clear winner.Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believethat it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?:^)Regards,Brianbqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu------------------------------------------------------------------------I am the engineer, I can choose K.------------------------------------------------------------------------Department of Engineering MechanicsOhio State UniversityColumbus, OH

A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractorsat least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50he has went 5 years without an overhaul.Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200Kmiles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomershad ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internalsof the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would beexpected of 30K miles not 200K.In my opinion it works.______________________________________________________________________________Beware!

 9  Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed.  Comes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector.  Does anyone have one of these alarms?  Are they any good?  From the looks of it, itsabout the best on the market for the price.  It's also on sale, so that's another reason to get it.  I think I'll be saving almost $200.  Any opinions?Eric Lucas

My feeling is that since many othercar makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineeringproblem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Hondaproducts - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.

 15I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS, it STILL hasthe ugly Caprice body (Orca on wheels).  The Caprice was the worst newbody style to come out of Detroit EVER! Now just because the LT1 engineand a few suspension tweeks are being added.Its STILL UGLY, its STILL a BARGE.  GM's answer to everything is "throw ina V8 and someone will buy it."  Or "add some plastic ground affectsand a few stickers and call it a GT, GTZ or SS, and someone will buy it."IMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with aBLANK sheet of paper.  No minor modification (wheel well treatments, tailamp modification, or nose re-design or even the LT1 engine) will helpthe existing Caprice.Jeff

Stay away from GEICO. A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket your premium will increase dramatically based on how much "over the limit" you were.  If I remember correctly, at "more than 20 over", you'll get something like a 65% increase.  If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped immediately.  One accident claim and you will be dropped. After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped  immediately.  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with no complaints. I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints. TRAVIS

If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death >due to less that wise driving practices, then TOUGH!!!Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer"for their own good" or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring apasser under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chancesof being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I couldimagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being "offed" or involved in an accident, especially if this "passer" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a personriding your bumper is certainly NOT a "wise driving practice", it only causes the jam to become more congested.  I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a "pack" of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never safe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,derision.       (Sorry this is soooooooo long.)

I don't have figures on average propertytax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferiorpublic schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount thegovernment steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who willargue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not tomention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannotbe valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that theyare not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actionsof a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime backto the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out,from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn'ttheir fault?

 7Yeah, diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars. They even have catalysts fitted to disels now! Oh and Citroen have even launched the 'First sports diesel car in the world'. Which is probably true if you assume if its for production purposes (Merc-Benz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in around 1968..... it did - and read this! - 200 MPH!!!)....Shaz....

I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo, ever.I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit-head Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes'. This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car.Not sure how long the small shit-box Volvos last - too damn long. The worst car I ever drove was a hired 340. In power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of somethingfrom the 50s, without the character. The 340 only ceased production a couple of years back. I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos, but that was enough. I ought to gofor a test drive because they offer some neat gifts.

 330Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim=============================================Background:    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from drivinga 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have beeninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combingthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought aremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I stillhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car wasalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well ashaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand Ican get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, thecar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinumplugs and valve adjustment.    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of smallscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on thehighway.    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bitconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  Tomy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seemsjust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by ofthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows andin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bitmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack upfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on theride later in this review.Engine:        As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was veryinterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha "Shogun" engine.  I was notdisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms isgood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, althoughI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is goodsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.(More on this later.)    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may beunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hithigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you canliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelvemore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, andyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch thetach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more thanadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valvesare used.Transmission:    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, theymarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifterinto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, andremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive thecar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under aFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than theone on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bitlarger and more forgiving.    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifterfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expectit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it'smuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it'sa clumsy shifter.    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impressfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily forthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find thispretty amazing in a car like this.    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothestshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to myToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-linebecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems morereasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter workssmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifterupgrade would help at all.    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gearssmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care tomatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This tookseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problemswere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at badshifts in higher gears.)    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifterrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next coupleof months.    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the theengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger candefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a "SHOsound" and is the gearbox -- apparently called "gear rollover".Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.Exterior:    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of thisSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille arevirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimesdon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford diddifferently to the SHO bodies.    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matchingcolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, theSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares atstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completelymonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with"SHO" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners havecolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feelalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different anddistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)Interior:    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve thecar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter arecovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done ina black/grey/metallic scheme.      The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedoand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, alarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrestthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coinholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holdingcassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly smallglove compartment.    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delightedto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in asink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics andthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before theinterior was upgraded!    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need somuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  Fromwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's hascracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all theway.    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normalhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake thatyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used toit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.Ride:    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer thanany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauterand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer withless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is anoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feelswonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- Ilistened for that before I bought the car.    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car fromChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alonefrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relativelyquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out whatexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the windowthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking thesuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is waytoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I wouldadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as withthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reasonto complain.  Let me explain...    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to thewheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steermaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, Iavoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn thewheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but whendriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem souseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the roadto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much betterthan the steering on my Celica ST.    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?Miscellaneous notes:    GRIPES:    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing asit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspensionand torque steer, I've never complained about ride.    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish theside bolsters would close more tightly.      I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  Icurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500for four.    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was itto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don'treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!Pretty ridiculous, though.    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torquedown low.    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  Ittook me a couple of days before I could really shiftsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted thatit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can makemy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled "Drive It Forever"for tips in this department.  :-)    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I onceparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutchafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced offthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed the glowing brake light.  Oops.)    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same    thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all theother windows work smoothly.    LIKES:    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The    cupholders are great.    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, butit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors bypressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  Andyou can never lock yourself out of the car.    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can'tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years ahead of schedule.  :-)    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents tolook into buying one.  I love this car so much that Iwrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of linesand ended up with this.      If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would havean opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at thispoint in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, youcan't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiumsas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twicethe horsepower.  Other Odds and Ends:    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  Ihaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs stillappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are alwaysquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe someof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, aswell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.      If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but maybe someone out there does.Gene Kim(genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)

 19One thing that everyone is forgetting in this argumentover the pricing of the SC1 vs. the Japanese cars isthe Saturns "no-dicker sticker".  This makes the Saturn'sprice low in comparison to the inflated base prices ofthe Japanese competition on paper, but in reality, onecould dicker several hundred dollars off the price ofthe Japanese cars.Admittedly, though, here in Canada, at least, the SC2 is in the same price class as the Civic Si, not theSC1.Steve Hui

 19NNTP-Posting-Host: OPCOG'day people,Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know whymy MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the enginenoise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 monthmark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for monthsnow) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving,but more so during idling. What's its problem? Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a littleperformance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. Any help/tips would be appreciated!!Worried.

I'm in Australia, so we always seem to get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as standard.My query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months afteran oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'musing (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. getsnoiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing). Its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.Puzzled.

The earlier cars (pre 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.  The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.****************************************************************************Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe.  *  MGA 1600 MkII                        **RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu            *  Rebuild (complete) to be finished ?? **Texas A&M University             *                                       **Keeper of the eternal octagon    *  `69 MGB Roadster                     ** a.k.a.

And my understanding, btw, isthat that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad-aptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no firsthand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degreeDOHC Colombo-designed V-12.

 175Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <Apr26.010609.17297@engr.washington.edu>Reply-To: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)NNTP-Posting-Host: lanmola.engr.washington.eduIt's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visitto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that hemakes a not too sucessful living selling them.Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:1) Servotronic steering:[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is thename for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF andused in Audis and BMWs.]I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the pastcouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives ofthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy toreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  Isuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has beenloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation thatI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be muchhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I nolonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car isruined.The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and Isuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information thatsome makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel andthere is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room forimprovement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than theJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in"feel" and engineer it out completely.2) EngineWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I didnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will beputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrificpunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that itencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is sosupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such afashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpmredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. whichtranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  Achracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.The technical achievement is breadthtaking.Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. Infact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshiftsare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the "overboost" featurethan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine featuresup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of likelighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with theright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just afew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lbft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it todevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quitea heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the CorradoVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to ridingin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, oneis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from theturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a veryrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds asserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quiteup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say thatin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack ofharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder barkthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle underfull boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far moremusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these canmatch its grunt.The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is takingoff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extrainertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhatdelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small priceto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America shouldoffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though inextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  Thecharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of theslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...3) ChassisI've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relativelymodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spokewheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulgewhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouthwatering macho, yet subdued look. On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 bodystyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well asroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but Idigress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carvedout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over roughroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampersdo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality willnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks orpony cars.The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it tobe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  wasable to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. Ithink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On abanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as Iwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where theskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally andcompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that thelimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces werethrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangelyuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End ofstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to thosereviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinicalefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car prettywell too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not toosurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a morewooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among theluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset byadditional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing tobrag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these daysseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused onanti-lock capability.4) ComfortFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are alsoexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panelinserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expectedgizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power thisand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removedbecause Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that thecar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account howmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, aswell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn'tconsider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enoughto sway a potential buyer.5) ConclusionEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker priceof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has tooffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even ifit doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan makeroffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some isworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 seriesAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets mythumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than beingall out exciting and intoxicating.eliot
 34I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to hear your comments.MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of thisproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor ishalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotoris powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed againstthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ftof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft oftorque. Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 ozbottle is $25.I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it wasso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn'tbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle againstmy common sense.Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.Jason Chen

If anyone has any ideas or knows someone that could help us outplease let me know....  The more recent, the better, but anythingwould be nice.

 29As you can see, I have two 1987 cars, both worth about $3000 each.The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars isrunning about $4000 per year and insurance $3000 per year.What am I doing wrong?Within the last two months, the follows costs have occured:Dodge 600 SE (Dodge's attempt at the American German car!)$1,000 - replace head gasket$300   - new radiatorChevy Nova CL (Chevy's attempt at a Japan import!)$500 - tune-up,oil change,valve gasket,middle exhaust pipe, misc.Note also that the Chevy Nova CL (1987) has only 70 horsepwer!Does anyone out there have a Chevy Nova with enough powerto get up even a small hill without knocking? Is theresomething wrong with my car, I even use 93 octane gas!(I have consider going to 110 octane if I can find it!)Anyway, what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself,and what equipment is needed?             Thanks,            -Doug (2 car Doug from Wayne,NJ)

 32I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  Thedesign was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhatofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuitdifficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  Thesecondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpointof practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoidexceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used.The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effectat a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the readingby bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for anautomobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH inoperation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your1993 RX-7!The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditionsunder which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle andvelocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult tocollect all sorts of interesting demographic information about thedrivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturercurrently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on readingout use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasionof your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about yourdriving style, it could also provide valuable information fromactual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my drivingdemographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.-- Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED

GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals   showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a  and some local governments.The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but   this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you  a riskier driver to insure.Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to gowith one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customerdiscounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid ascommission. That's another story for another day.

You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in NorthAmerica.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, thedistributors) are not interested in manual trannies.The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.I have an '87 300E, with a "mere" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find thatit has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is alwaysnice, but I can't complain.I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously "hook" into   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it   does not have this problem.)3) Huge interior and cargo space.4) The most "rubbery" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed   the car for an automatic.5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does   not exhibit these characteristics.)You should also check out the new BMW 525 "touring".  This is a wagon versionof the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.--Michael Chmilarchmilar@apple.com

This means that the car maynot have significant investment value but could be an excellent driverand or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the CorvetteBlack Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest afew hours in reading the "Corvette Buyer's Guide" and purchase NolandAdams' tape "How to Buy a Corvette."  The tape shows you how to checkfor damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect thevalue, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  Thelist is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet wherethere are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintagevettes) that are available to help you.

I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we'redressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by apurse.If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted themanufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I thinkmanufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.

Parts are thus muchharder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are nottoo difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuffincluding a brand new (not remfg) long block.

I don't think its a chopped up U.S. unit.  It may be called aKangaroo or Roo or something similar-not sure.  But, I do recall readingthat Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines.  The Ford V-8 Interceptoris, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  Whatever the case that small carwith a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires formiles/kilometers.

 21It did it again.  This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM.Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle wouldcause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck).What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time totime, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach,but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fastas it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled upat a stop light.Many thanks for any suggestions. - les-- Les BartelI'm going to live foreverIntergraph Corporation... or die tryingElectronics Divisionljbartel@ingr.comor ljbartel@naomi.b23b.ingr.com(205) 730-8537

 16Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one ofthose car hunters?  I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contactedby this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.  They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn'tbe talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everythingabout my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that ifthey didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and sinceI charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,I would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which isgood news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's beenover week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of companies? Anybody care to share their experiences?

 22First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile divisionis "Infiniti" not "Infinity."  I would also like to clear up the questionof what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since aperson had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti modelshad V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of eachmanufacturer used V8 engines.Lexus:  LS400- V8  GS300- V6  ES300- V6  SC400- V8  SC300- V6Infiniti:  Q45- V8  J30- V6  G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here)I hope this helps.-BSB
 51Nntp-Posting-Host: ssc.sas.upenn.eduMy 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reachedthe threshold of total number of mechanical problems thatI am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might beable to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,please e-mail or post!1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,   there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.   What could cause this?  Is the differential going   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the   trunk!)  2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes   might help -- could anything else cause this?4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put   through all the gears and then back to park, as per   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD ownersout there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and convertedinto taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get ajunk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to bejunked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most ofthe rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers andImpalas (& Broughams).-- Andrew Whiteawhite@mcneil.sas.upenn.edu

Just wondering.....In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised,of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.  Also, most Canadians aretoo stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my twofeet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_operate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it can't be done).  Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic as standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift for you for no addition money.|> -- |> ___________________________________________________________________ ____/||> John Kissane                           | Motorola Ireland Ltd.,   | \\'o.O'|> UUCP    : ..uunet!motcid!glas!kissanej | Mahon Industrial Estate, | =() ()=|> Internet: kissanej@glas.rtsg.mot.com   | Blackrock, Cork, Ireland |    U-- Doug Zolmer  Internet: dwjz@bnr.ca  Disclaimer: My opinions only   1 3 5Bell-Northern Research Ltd.

I'd assume easier,>since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting>gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply withthe newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged.2. All use an "aftercooler", which cools the air which was heated   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is   low.No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path fromthe turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarketturbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,and these are approved by the CARB.Dan Hepner

Is paste or liquid better?I would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, I guessusing cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?).I've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Waxand Raindance not being very good, so I'm wondering what isrecommended for a quality finish.Thanks in advance.Bill-- Bill Heiser    heiser@acs.bu.edu, heiser@world.std.com               Boston University, Boston MA
 10Thanx Craig.... in addition to Craigs coments - and to clear up any further confusion.... the 200SX (of USA) was reffered to as a Silvia Turboin the UK.... performance figures of UK 200SX are:0-60: 6.4sVmax: 142mph...Shaz.. Oh one more Q: you know that new Prelude VTEC? Well is there an auto versionin the USA? I've heard of them in Japan but not UK. Also, do you guys get auto Miatas?

It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is wherethe water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the reartaillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replacedthe entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This timeI happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  Thedealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them tofix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the sameproblem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to tryto take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some ventand drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This isgetting very annoying.

 10Why crawl under the car at all? I have a machine I got for my boat that pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. It does anexcellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more old oil out than by using the drain plug. I think I paid $25 at E&B Marine.The oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant intoyour favorite device. I use soft drink bottles. Easy to take them down tothe local oil recycle center.FORZA!

I thought it was worth lookinginto (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned thisto a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror storyabout her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,ending with engine noises which she said "was somethingwith the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, saidthey were working on it, but didn't have a cure as ofyet.

 46My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you.  There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously.I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for a "use deduction" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance.Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 tonHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems that required attention included the transmission, heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts.So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you paid too much in the first place, or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com
 7The answer to your question is...sort of. Volkswagen had amuch less robust version of this army vehicle out in theearly '70's (or thereabouts). It was called the VolskwagenThing, and was, of course, a convertible. I havent seenmany around then or now. Good luck...-Mik

 14I am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaustfor my 1981 BMW 320i. So far, I have found a Pacesetter exhaust for $219and an Ansa exhaust for $190 (Canadian funds). I was wondering if anyonecould tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possibleexhausts that I may be interested in. My main priorities are a decent horsepower increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power.I was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz exhausts.Has anyone got anything to say about these? I am mainly looking for the muffleronly but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit I would be willing togo after that. I also would like to know how much these would cost me in the States.Please mail me back if you have any information.Mike Welker

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big tripI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.No problems with winds and curves. Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - wherewe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I seeno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the tripback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mindyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly betterthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I stillget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.>|> b) I can't understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid>|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in>|>    the low gears.

 9We were at a dealership today looking at buying a car andthe salesman was showing us something he was calling a"buy back".  Is that a car that was fleeted and thengiven back for the new model the next year?  If thatis so, how many miles is a good number to have on itand are these types of cars generally a good buy?Thanks,Ellen

In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would inevitably wind up dead early anyway.   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water, he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so- gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our modern North American society have done to us over the years.

There is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs"& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are verycorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of thegears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears backand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time theclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it intothe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutralbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with theshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  "speed shifting"(which is what I have always heard "clutchless shifting" called) workspretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use theclutch-especially for the lower gears.I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that theengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition ofsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissionsthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverseand sometimes first).  --Frank Ball   1UR-M          frankb@sad.hp.com    (707) 794-4168 work,Hewlett Packard             (707) 794-3844 fax,  (707) 538-3693 home1212 Valley House Drive     IT175, XT350, Seca 750, '62 F-100, PL510Rohnert Park CA 94928-4999  KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I'm the NRA.

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea toget one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants yourvehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down anythieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:1)ignition kill or fuel cut-off2)a flashing red LEDThese two are basic to a decent alarm system.

 508Archive-name: rec-autos/part5[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonlyasked automotive questions; the other article contains questionsmore geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crosspostedto misc.consumers.  -- rpw]   [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]                 Commonly Asked Automotive QuestionsTire Questions:Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to    150MPH.)    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum    per-tire loads:    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at    all.    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put    normal tires on the car?A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side    of my car?A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the    car should I put them on?A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits    in this Q&A posting?A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.Safety Equipment:Q:  Do airbags really work?A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.Brake Questions:Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas    always wants to do this.A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,    or badly grooved.Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is    this really a good idea?A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a    car with an automatic to take the test.Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where    most of the corrosion occurs.    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the    economics are questionable for street use.    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little    information at this time.Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs    more.  Is it worth it?A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original    equipment or OE-equivalent components.    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this    eventuality.    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an    ABS system in your car.    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid    becomes very important.Q:  What about this threshold braking business?A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is    needed here -- rpw]    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're    not very near the threshold.    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS    take over.    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at    the pedal will be sufficient.    Gas Questions:Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car    needs.Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not    actually require leaded gasoline.Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected    cars.    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything    in your gas tank.    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,    once every six months, is highly recommended.Q:  What about detergent gasolines?A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.Lubrication Questions:Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on    your wallet at all times.Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty    as conventional oils.    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.    How often should I change my oil?A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out    of storage.Misc. Questions:Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they    break.  What's the story?A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water    pump can be a costly mistake.)Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance    oriented vehicles.Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator    is probably the cause.-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith

 14I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase.I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car.I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car.But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, oron the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives inAlbany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.  Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase andregister a used car ?  (I've never done this before.)Thank you,Peter Volpe

If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speedmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in mytruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either startsrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet says that the noise is "a characteristic of the transmission."Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, thegear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I shouldpoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is adetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  Theydropped the compression ratio, supposedly for "engine longevity"reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from beingshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link betweenstabilizer and control arm fell off).Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  Whatreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attemptto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time.

Thanks.This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't informthe dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committedfraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If theprevious owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact thatthe odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he hasto report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me thatthe old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/MotorVehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what yourrights are.

 7     I used to drive a truck a few years back. I once rode with an old codgerthat had been driving for about 30 yrs. The only time he would use the clutchwas to get the truck moving. He could shift that 13 speed lightning quick, upor down, without the slightest rake of a gear. He was as smooth as silk. It wasthe most amazing shifting demonstration I've ever seen! Having said all that I still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without aclutch? Why do it?

 7Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.   There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say "Go to authorized mazda dealer.". It is really good idea. Don't you think so?   I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as "authorized mazda dealer" can give ?Youjip Wonyjwon@cs.umn.edu
 9Hi,My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without usingthe gas peddel. The repairman said it has a internal leak of air inthe carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). She likesto know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacingthe whole carburetor.Thank you.

My criteria: a "fun" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.The Celica was "ok" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhatoverpriced too) in non-turbo form.I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at itfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see itsreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:My dislikes:Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.Headlights have "stuck" up a few times (weather?)air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford partsunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day whenI bash my head on the corner.horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car My Likes:engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)transmission (the 5 speed is a must)usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)low cowl (good visibility in front)Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)ABS/Air bag (see above)rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn'thave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big sellingpoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changedmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from workeach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that theProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll findthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car ridesdifferently (if that's "better" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glassaround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets prettyhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain aboutthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined withthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car soI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for theinevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assumethat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wipercontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with theEagles (and I was really trying).  There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GThas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plasticthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/armrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch"but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.Nathannathan@sco.com>>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |>|B.S.

The blue book is justa hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkableand blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats outof a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakersi took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rearaxels, ford 9" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new onesthat might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sicklyTTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms wereas the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspectivewheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a fewdings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops werediscontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable topfor 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if youhave the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad,i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too.One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or aToyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will havea hard time getting up into it.BOB

 9We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. Let me ask a similar question from the aviation field. You must have seen images of prop planes with all cylinders exposed. I have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. This arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. How can one crankshaft throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the outside.Bijan

Frankly, the Saturnway of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a newcar since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended bymost salespeople I met.Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer whereI bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-salessupport, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly whatI wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at thedealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based onwhat he's seen and heard from his customers. Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 orso, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's morelike $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during anywarranty work, without counting against the refund.--mike

It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generallydo, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give upthe profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-car profits.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of      directions and clues guiding participates around the       Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately       lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is       set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified      4x4s can run the course.       At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.

Every government agency worth its salt finds some reasonto levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven differentfees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucraticinefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgroundswanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's likeHyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyoneelse, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, thecar either won't go forward or won't stop at all.

Almost every car I've ever owned has beena 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a prettyhigh-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed withtorque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on thehighway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has beenaround 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the"control" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns outto be very convenient.

Hesaid, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when ithad 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  Hequoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it.

 23I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurancecompanies in California to get estimates. I asked for the samecoverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge youaccording to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here'swhat I found (for a '93 Integra GS):AAA: ~$2000/yr.State Farm: 2614.92/yr.Allstate: 1220/yr.AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about$200-300 back at the end of the year.Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farmwants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should besuspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.Any comments?Thanks,Gregg L. Kastengregg@cs.stanford.edu

 26I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positivelythe worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles onit when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religiousattention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven inexactly the same manner..  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles  6. Two timing belts.  7. Constant error signals from computer.  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4     weeks to get because it is on national back order.      Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.No way would I ever buy another Acura. It is highly overrated. .

 28Eve'.I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don'thave much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Doesanyone have any experience with the following brands?RikenFalkenBFGGeneralThere are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. LikeI said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since Ihardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that"noone will give you warranty on such tires", according toa tire dealer?Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again),or is that strictly a speed factor?Thanks for any replies..--             |         "Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger."_________  -+-__      _________     \\_____  /   |/_ \\     \\  _____/           Internet: vpopesc@calstatela.edu \\_____ \\_____/  \\____/  ____/            Bitnet:   vpopesc@csla.BITNET
 12Hi there, maybe you can help me...I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearboxseems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly asbad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could itjust be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid.Or am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also havean old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...Thanks,Derek
 21I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best detector available. The point here is trust and reliability. I've been able to "trust" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine says that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's more than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want to drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost always better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human brain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall strength of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that eachbogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, you'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think it works okay.Although, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem ofone radar souce.Thomas

The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factoryservice manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic wassupposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the lockingnut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since noone ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the lockinglugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, Ifound out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got ridof the locking nuts. :-(My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at thedealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.

I haven't had any vibration problemswith the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I didhave some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tirebalancing.Tom

 34I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon.  Third gear wouldjust disengage.  Engine would rev up.  Kind of disconcerting.I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that trannysticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealercould not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that carwould have been covered.I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was mycontribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen anybad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit ofclutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would neverpurchase another American car with a standard.  American manufacturersdon't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions andhave been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars.However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars.Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.Cheers, Larry--    @@               Larry Rogers               *   @@@               larry_rogers@dg.com        *   Big Brother   @@@ &&&           larry@boris.webo.dg.com    *   is Watching    @@ &&            Data General  508-870-8441 * The opinions contained herein are my own, and do not reflect theopinions of Data General or anyone else, but they should."Sometimes we are the windshield, sometimes we are the bug"   Dire Straits

Seems> Lexus can't stop popping out new models.--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models  is the "300", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (the  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look  completely different.--Aamir Qazi-- Aamir Qaziqazi@csd4.csd.uwm.edu--Why should I care?  I'd rather watch drying paint.

Any info on the substitutes' corresponding usefullness?    I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what you should do instead.     I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the Ozone Depletion Problem.)     Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms. Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem. Fred W.

 11Which Western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference betweena new car's price and the trade-in's value?  I know California charges you on the full value of the new vehicle regardless of trade-in.If you are a California resident, is it legal to buy a car in a state other thanCalifornia without also paying California sales tax?  How does California enforce any law that requires you to also pay California sales tax (on top of the out-of-state tax)?-- Will EstesInternet: westes@netcom.com

 34I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  BeforeI delve into its innards, I thought I'd check "net.wisdom" on thesubject. :)It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)2.0l EFI 4-bangerauto35k milesWhen I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially athighways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit ofgetting "stuck" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop fora light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waitingfor 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmissionto "reset" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls whenput in drive.  My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and gettingstuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-upconverter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The leastlikely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuumhose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack ofvaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).My background is that my father owns a service station andI worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Pleasefeel free to be as technical as you want. :)I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of freebeer. <grin>Skoal,Chris

Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  >Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake>cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seemsto me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not needto calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a littlemore.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than youthe car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you shouldlet him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startledby drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my faultfor not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had myliscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed bycars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is thefact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along withthem, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenalinewill do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anythingover the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybethey should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....just curious, and my .otwoDREW

It's also cheaper.Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reasonthey are considered "cleaner" is because they are better at the emissions weactually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissionswhich have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control orlimits have been defined.  Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissionsand suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulatesare now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emitsignifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidenceis mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we mayhave been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours inrush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels isawful and it can even burn the eyes.  Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards. Mark

You will also note that every time they have to spin the tiresin the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't makea burnout on a dry road!

Just a guess, but I think you'd have to drive it counter-clockwise, which would require a reversible drill.

Read the service manual and get your head out of thesand! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignmentrack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if notmore accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work.You can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools andsome imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangeringanyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well,you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be ableto steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision isso poor that they would screw up this badly!)I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wallwith sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take thecertification course, and look at the people that have never learned to addin their whole life that are taking the certification!BTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings)because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 ChryslerLaser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully weldedspacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit moredifficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure thespace between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed onupper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain).This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up*right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference thatthe original poster might not ...Ciao -- Mark

Stuff deleted...I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sportfor a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto thefreeway.  Several persons were killed when said blocks came throughtheir windshields.  Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and theyhave made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stopsuch people).  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced.  I always look up at abridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this*sport* has not reached us here in Fresno.___________________________________________________________________Greg_Lewis@csufresno.eduPhotojournalism sequence, Department of JournalismCSU Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740

I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that theseelectronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?  What kind ofmemory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough(of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of avehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work forthis length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with thatare doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car witha replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300Kactual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of anew odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell thebuyer it has.Thanks for any insight.Kim Greer                       Duke University Medical Center klg@orion.mc.duke.eduDiv.

I had the pleasure ofdoing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty atfull speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you goa high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out ofit.  (If you speedo doesn't burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mileodometer would take 22 days or so.
