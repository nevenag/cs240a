This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!

In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  itself iscalled LOG.The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSIpackage. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.  Itshould be available at Berkley.That's all I got so far.Mark__________________________________________________________________________ _____Mark NiederbergerEmail:   mniederb@itr.ch__________________________________________________________________________ _____

If you have an idea about its voltage and current ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON" at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to experiment with various gain-altering techniques.Bill Willis     willisw@coe-nw.clemson.edu(803) 656-5550

Strictly,a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output changestate, according to the inputs.A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine whichof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there arethree inputs required.A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enableinput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, alloutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) outputwill be low).An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) toselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve youraim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Notethat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, sinceyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) leftonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plusa mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, usethe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide thefour enable lines.Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to thefour final stage decoders.Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power ampchips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to theinput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to bothchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to anoutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be goodenough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone andbalance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs ofthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably before the other controls).  If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you shouldprobably forget the whole thing. --- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CAInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055

Carpenter) writes:>>> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the>> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?>>Yes. It's called RADAR.Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distancesby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive itsreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimetersuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case ofthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500feet altitude.Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the posteroriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements betweena transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accuratetime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmittertriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actuallytravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the differenceis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to acommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Somethinglike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering boththe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where againthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.should know about anyway ;-).>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmittervaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmissionline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unitover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. Withthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located atone place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base forthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this>concept.Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unlessthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhanceattenuation of multipath signals.

So, I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:Ai [Current Gain]Av [Voltage Gain]Ap [Power Gain]or whatever.I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, butI would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the partslist has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 magso it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement inthe latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I couldfigure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for Highpower amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse thanI started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yetgood gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News...

That level of analog multiplexing shouldbe rather easy to accomplish.Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do withoutgenerating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner isin a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult tokeep balanced.A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed witha little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever lawsgovern the use of transeivers in your location.-- Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED

I know for sure that a DIP will not work(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, soI am trying to choose between a flatpak and aleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hardto test since it has to be soldered on to the testsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chipcarrier sockets also have long lead lines and maynot work at high speeds. Does anyone out there have experience/knowledgeof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packageswould help.  P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bitof overkill(?) --- Seema Varma

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment isALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it takes a while).If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screwthings up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DCon charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time whenyou "need" it.Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at leastSOME of this helped.

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, Iask this again:1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies   hole currents over normal electron currents?3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).NOTES:   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole   particles only exist in the presence of matter.   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such   currents *if* they exist.   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.Thanx,Eric.---- ET   "A Force of Nature"----

Anyone seen this before?What is happening is this:1) You turn the TV on.2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.Things to check:First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the verticaloutput transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The mostcommon cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawnsomewhere.Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillatorthen it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

Therefore pink noise contains much morelow-frequency components.The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaringanimals.

If the ground connections on the outlets areconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to themain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house groundrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one ofthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hotto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.

This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!

Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whosebandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constantbandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whosebandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as "1/3octave" or "1/2 octave" or some such terminology).White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3db/octave).-- |                Dick Pierce                ||    Loudspeaker and Software Consulting    || 17 Sartelle Street   Pepperell, MA  01463 ||       (508) 433-9183 (Voice and FAX)      |

This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligiblyless than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a littledepending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio orthe availability of parts.Hows that sound?---Joel KolstadP.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can beaccurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well askeeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

It measures the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable.                  What could the problems be and what else could I useto lower the input voltage?

Some involvemodifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing havebeen successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of newways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The factis, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more orless difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if notimpossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a goodone for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you tryingto crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption offiles which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copyprotected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas forpractical applications, and are merely curious?Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as Ican.Incidentally, the "Uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dreadanyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feelswhen they are asked how to hack.

Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment(octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the sameamount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave.    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment(Hz, kHz, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount ofnoise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide).    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octavefilter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs).Note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network :-(    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)as a flat line across the bands.DaveP

I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recievingcircuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confusedabuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillatorfrequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (assimple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across aMC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs(ACTIVE,etc...) Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyonemay have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILEDELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot ofcircuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.Thanks,Mark Musone

GANDLER) writes:>>How does the radio Electronics free information cards work.>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a>catalog. That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertisergets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readerswho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data onself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide thedata on computer disk.The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You willnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly calleda "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company nameand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, nationaladvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals asbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your companyand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probablysend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineercall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are theywill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retailoutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you the whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, havenothing to mail out accept the catalog.A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industrymagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. Theyuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do readthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or pushyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compilehow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readersrequesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, somemagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. Forexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested informationabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazinesinclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, theadvertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" fromthe serious potential customers."Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of  weeks later.  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data  on a computer printout.  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're  not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every  other month and circle two or three numbers.  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.  Advertisers almost never call.

Around the base of the hourglass is aring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenserin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled throughthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  Thesensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force fordraft generation.It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used onboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used parttime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typicallytakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

When will people learn!The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to contact the ballast. Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and counting)  TC.

I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulatorsand learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies...(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with prettygood results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problemswhen I try to design & build anything that puts out seriousamps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on mybench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding forthe usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to looseme... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a fullschematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'dlove to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from suchlow volume :-)My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on myown (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take anycourse that covers transistors ;-)So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercialmodels and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not whatI'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematicsand a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? Take care.P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8Aand -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will bemore than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.Would like to have a working model in a year or so... :-) (Do I have a chance to make it?)-- / Filip "I'll buy a vowel" Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail "fmgst+@pitt.edu"  \\| All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $0.99 so respond NOW!!!! | | I live for my EE major, winsurfing, programming, SCA, and assorted dreams. |\\ 200MB Drive - Linux has 100MB and MS-DOS has 100MB.

They make membrane keypadsthat are very flat, in layouts from 2 to 128 keys.  Theyhave standard models, tactile models (with stainless domesunder each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well asbacklit models.  Some of them can even be cut with scissorsto form a funky shape other than a rectangle.  Many of themodels are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel,colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to makeyour own layout.  One piece prices aren't cheap, though,as they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45for a 40 position *kit*.I have no affiliation with Dimolex or any company connectedwith them.  I *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them,and am pleased with what I got.Cheers,Alan<acooney@netcom.com>

Both produce very good output,but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJetoutput is definitely superior.  On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and usethe cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, muchworse than a bubblejet. :-)One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really goodlooking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some ofthe really good style bubblejets.---Joel KolstadP.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I canhighly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portableCanons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).

A few points need to be clarified:The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, orthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  Itshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry thenormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the groundingconductor.  Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the groundingconductors to provide reliable operation  ("orange" outlets are often used forthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and inmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should readboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulatedgrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the serviceentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not providea safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which isreferred to in the code as the "identified" conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrancepanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many householdservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  Inthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the groundingconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipmenthas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the "U"ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does notpresent a shock hazard.  HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, youwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire ofinadequate size, causing it to overheat.With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, oftencausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path backto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of itflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the "hot" conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, notit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at anysub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperatewire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the daysbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want tohave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in placeof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings(since most current is in the 220 volt "hots" except at some low settings, thewires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,it's primarily for lightning protection.People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal groundingconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in "romex" 'with ground' is.  Anywherethere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bondinglocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  "Greenfield" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't havethe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield."Wiremold" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact, and the "feed" to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were "hot" with120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can "bond" the wire to thebox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outletswhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have theprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don'tinstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It isdesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungroundedGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might berenumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much moreto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

OK ?Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.         It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry          conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find         a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one          side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the          energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of         energy that carnot will give them.         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent         radioactive pollution of the environment !            -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.    -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

In our case, othermonitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to bespecific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit thisproblem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etcseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but thejuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other sideof wall maybe?We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable inputlines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interferenceeffect on the computer monitor next to it. Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (verycommon, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection typeO'scopes).I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mountaround deflection coil of interfering monitor. BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGHVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'TBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TOMOUNT CAN.Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is alsogood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield onmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those othersources.Jeff Babbbabb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.eduProgrammer, SDSU - LARC

A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the gameGODS and asked me for help since he could not find a "trainer" (smallpatch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed butI did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* filewould not affect the decompression and would also prevent the "shield" in thegame from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way oranother and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copyprotection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possiblycompressed), dongles, key disks, etc...I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protectionschemes.>--> Michael Chen| From the depths of our most lucid horrors |>| spring our fond hopes and pure desires... |> mchen@cs.psu.edu| except what comes from HELL! :-) 7/23/92  |-- Alex T.

Raw HC11 parts have factory setROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts haveEEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them userprogrammable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. Themore expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dipvarieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposingthe EPROM array to light.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "TheHungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat sourceis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box withventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the airto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks arespaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Useyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens maynot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins orracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on myoven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick awooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and closethe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allowsfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check itoften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you areusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfwaythrough.If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right subfor this stuff.gerald.belton@ozonehole.com * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.                       ----The Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-31423 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 FilesSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet NewsgroupsPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com

I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip numbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, which will do you NO good for reading in.            Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.  In pascal, you would "Write(Port[xxx]);" where xxx is the address in either hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, do "Port[xxx]:=value".                 Hope this helps.        Let me know if you need more help.    _________________________________________________  Inspiration  |   ___                             |  comes to     |  \\   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |  seek the     |   /-\\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |  unknown.     |                                   |  -------------------------------------------------

However, sonar A detects the INIT lineof sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at thetime the init line of sonar B is activated.

I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...The output value was only about 10% of the previous one!    Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter actually measure? And what does it show?     Related question (less important to me):   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones?    Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion atavm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. I would appreciate either way.Alexander V.

I forget exactly how wide the polylines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probablyomit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a highresistance it can be ignored at these speeds).4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run withslightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially foroutput signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big fora MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as Ineeded.

Is this true?I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no  amp which can touch it at the price range.The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other   amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components   in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the  amplifiers sound so brilliant.I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded  like new.If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.--*************************************************************************    Alan Webber                                                    ****                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          ****                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          ****                                                                   **** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    *************************************************************************

So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.   Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle   for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially   if there is some "key" item that can get lost.   So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but   would make life somewhat of a misery for them.(This is my opinion, and I speak as a legitimate user :-)You are of course free to have your opinion about this subject....--einari@rhi.hi.is

Hmmmmm....> There is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound,or in your words, "it DOES have a bearing on....".Now, I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combinationstove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan,but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperaturevariation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  And sincejunction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimentaleffect on linearity.  a few facts:-bias points vary with temperature-junction resist varrie with temp-Adcom products do NOT run class-AIf you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirementsfor most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifierwarm-up.  On many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes forthe output stage, many hours for the drivers.  Fortunately the driversare not switched.In any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening,betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias(idle current) level.  Both have a positive correlation with lowdistortion and "good" sound quality, and high bias results inwarmer operation, all other factors being equal.Grant

I think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery isnot being charged or discharged. I remember some advice from an ancient carmanual guide my father had, which was to use car batteries to power a garageclock or something similar when they're not in a car.

The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind ofcritical.  I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, whichputs the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mountingit with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at asmall clearance.

But one is also connected to everygrounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment pluggedinto isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happensto accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on ituntil the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolatedground will remain relatively noise-free.

Also, make sure that yourprogram can not be run out a debugger.Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk withgarbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk insome random sector.Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but theyare both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is theopposite of what you want.Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of themachine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you canthink of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, itrequests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk shouldbe encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anythingelse you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Onceagain, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRCchecks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among otherthings, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects achange in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in theprogram.  Tell them the program is "VIRUS SECURE", and remember, you havehelped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can'tdo it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off inthe process!).

As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many>>fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive>>contamination.Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller thannuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when manyfossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) manyfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations wereadopted ("why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.").  3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generallynot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossilplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about "thermal >pollution" de-icing a river, said, "Up here, we view heat as a resource".  Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plantsof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible inorder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure isnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It isdesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocitycauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowestpressure condensing environment is always the best.  A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (wherethe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since thecondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash intosteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is aparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at allcosts.  The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plantin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get inthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term isused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling towersystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river wateris pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higherhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce thecondenser area.At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in theair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the dischargewater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge waterfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature andhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river watertemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical"95-95" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successfulin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for theplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature getstoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessivepressure.>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is >purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when>the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than >cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity andfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understoodthe costs of impure water.  By "impure", I mean water with a fewdozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolvedoxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory.John-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

A continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that needshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magneticfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,like a Faraday cage.The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be areal problem (one that bit me once).

Supposedly, the government rethought thissoon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF oftheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space isquickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that whichtravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,the published data showed that when noise drowned out regularreception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of theman who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methodswere correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".---- ET   "Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes."----

A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their servermodels.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  Thereused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase inTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME busesthough.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, butI think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.Cheers,Corwin

You'll probably find thatit already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren'tbeing used.  A couple of cables and you're in business.Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VDoutputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to thecameras.If neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a syncseparator.  Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators -they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.Dave

When I asked, people said that theinterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly morecomplicated.Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective"sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequencyantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversamplinglets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higheroversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality ofall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling shouldallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-aliasfiltering.---Joel Kolstad

RS-485 boards are availablefor PC's, probably cheaper than a bunch of RS-232 channels, and RS-485 ischeaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply8-pin DIP driver chip.  Software at the PC end would be similarly complexfor either RS-232 or RS-485, in my opinion.  The higher data rates possiblewith RS-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.Hope this helps.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Rod Nussbaumer, Programmer/Technologist       Bitnet: BOMR@TRIUMFER  TRIUMF --- University of British Columbia,  Internet: bomr@erich.triumf.ca  Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Any one determined enough to break copyprotection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entireload-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to makesuch attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.

All of the analog electronics are working fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 1000-10,000.Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part number, or when they do look around for something in their line they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in quantity.I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.-Joe Bettsbetts@netcom.comP.S.

There is no difference whether the output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision copy protection.)In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.It is a pretty lame scare tactic.

The simplest and virtually fool-proof way isfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a differentmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (dependson the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's conscience should do that.I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of "casual"users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights(It's the truth.  I have "friends" who ask me for copies of my latest gamesall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casualpirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection willdiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my "friends" dug upsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actualrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disablethe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determinedpirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked oncefound by authorities.  It is the "casual" pirates that the copy protection isdetermined to discourage.What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plusa special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above.Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating andmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message isencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides astable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thusviolated their license agreement.This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as onlyproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and thereforegains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?--Kasey Chang

Older original deskjet andpossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide withrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the rightside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have agray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allowyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be informationpackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed acoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the newcapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed findthat the cartidges now last longer.I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting yournearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanicalcomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer andthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my originaldesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You arelikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a newdeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading anoriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but nosoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swappingthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HPservice center for further information.The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different fromthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laserprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send araster end command after each scan line.  This makes no materialdifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print theaccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideouslyslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers arestill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfectworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect worksefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression thatpermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only onemegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large asabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory forits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support bandedprinting that allows incrmental download of the image withcompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadablefonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  Thisis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjetprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printerhas completed its warm-up cyle.Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in imagedeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, butmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate theproblem.Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumablecomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy wastecould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowingstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in thelaserjet IV.Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphoussilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The imagedrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very niceprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also hasa neat modular paper source and stacker system.The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lowerthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers aresubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  Theusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is asingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport isalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  Ifyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with theappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.-- Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED

TTL?ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's alongwith PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to namea few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as longas you adhere to sound engineering practices.  A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System DesignHandbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is consideredto be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.The very fact that you need to build a test fixture meansyou're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itselfhas far more inductance per pin than the package you aretesting, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  Idon't see the big concern over the packaging because itprobably isn't going to make that much differenceIf you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.:-(aaronP.S.

A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have thedistributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks itin the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which weresent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order totrack in store piracy.Possible additional program security schemes would be:1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in   and registration. (inconvenient)2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness)4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or   memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc.    (only as effective as above methods at best.)5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked    copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably   illegal, certainly immoral)my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thoughtif I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.What is the problem with parallel port security keys?

This isn't a perfect solution,though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don'tdecide to talk at the _exact same time_.Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to "something"that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as itused to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPSor slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplexthe data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the firstparagraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk morethan 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to beable to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,though.

The plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons, of different frequencies, in each room, and tell the 567 what frequency to phase-lock to. We did not do so.One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps!Knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor technique of RESECTION to determine robot location. (No, I ain't going toexplain resection over the net.)Given hindsight, I would digitize the amplified output of the self-nullingphototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves atthe several expected frequencies, to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon.By doing this at the numerous steps, even with  8 degree steps, with knowledgeof the angular response of the phototransistor, you SHOULD be able torather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.Allen Sullivan

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basicallymodified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weightof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM fortheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but Iwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hackingwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM intoa RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way tobackup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games couldbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load theminto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've gottwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsacartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping andhandling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo(interested in that too?).Hope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502's out too,since they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).-shishin "squish" yamadasquish@endor.harvard.edu

In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more resistive.Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.  TC.

Escort makes alaser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However,I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if youare lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car infront of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to yourdetector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travelsin all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buytheir wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'llsave $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition ofthe laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport1000 normally costs $100).--Eddie GornishUniversity of Illinois - Center for Supercomputing Research & Developmentgornish@csrd.uiuc.edu

The air flow ofsmall 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with workingvoltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study isusually required to experimentally determine the best sizecapacitor for a given application.For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.

After a while wegot round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the lastguy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 voltbus.   But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a lot of them got "funny" in the LCD display.  A black stain wouldspread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from thoseZebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, thelow-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with silicone).   What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges orturn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit ofclever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the worldsafer for electricans, anyway.   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

Thanks a million...BTW- Anyone who works/has worked for Atari, I could really use your help with info on the old 2600, please email me if you are willing to help me.... thatnksalot!!-Peter

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mVIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower thanthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expectinside a PC.Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a lowdistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  DigitalDomain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitizedwaveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor onthe spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking atthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) completesampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and ituses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolatedfrom the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog designguide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.

That'swhy the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor worksto help keep from killing the battery as fast ---- it insulates the batterythermally. It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it willself-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small loadsuch as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave iton constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to "shallow-cycle" the charge in the battery. Such mild "exercising" of a lead-acidbattery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte forstorage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storagecontainers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cellswhen you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new batteryin a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an olderbattery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   storage.-- =============================================================================Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX)      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also beable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to becheap.  My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; eachcompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - inputwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. Ineeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire thecompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but mycircuit would not detect it.   The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference thenthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  Infact the difference between completely black and completely white isonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify thevideo signals to make this work.  There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariatorwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supplycircuit.  At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistorcircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designingtransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Anyideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatlyappreciated.

Ignorance of the patented status isnot a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damagesa court would award.However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,almost certainly it is "obvious to one skilled in the art" and thereforeunpatentable.

Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.   We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of  over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   "Pirate board" or no pirate board.  I too have "friends" who blatantly and  quite successfuly "hack" copy protection schemes practically in their  sleep.Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and "acting" similar to  the average user, and maintaining "behind-the-scenes" consistency is a  real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  disk.Often we have hardware problems at peak "business" times and have to do  some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with "copy  protection" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain   . .In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  legitimate user with a "copy protection" scheme!Sorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)Mark S.

After having it awhileI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, thereseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans somerandom 50mV bias.The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn outputwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessedfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the inputimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits havemaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most haveinput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order touse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thingreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of mycircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but nowwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind ofa pain in  the ass.Is there any way I could make myself a little box that couldsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generatorinput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is somelow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factorof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'dlike to have this box not be active.Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons Ihad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. Thefunction generator was the same way on that one, too.please help as I am feeling very stupid today,dave dgj2y@virginia.edu

However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own.

When I asked, people said that the>interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more>complicated.You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is notinterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signalyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru anall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person'sheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaksthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with theproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken atthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but notunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with thingsin realtime if you write efficient code.In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody outthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line withresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me asthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.>Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective">sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency>antialiasing filters.

I would guess that it is acutally cheaper tofilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components andgive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that theycharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They arebuilt to a price spec, and that spec says "cheap as possible!". >---Joel Kolstad  -dave-- Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                        37N 17.382    121W 59.190

Making a bunchof these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make surethings won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at leastdefeats your approach.

Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOSinformation is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOSmanufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade themotherboard.

Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in thelong cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  Iwould suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on shortpeaks.You can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or trystrapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,which will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you'regoing to need a bigger generator.I assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched thevoltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming outof the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.>Can anyone offer any advice?

Thanks.Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connectingall your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so thesignal sources aren't driving directly into each other. Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixinghigh-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixingline-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.input 1 --/\\/\\/\\/ -------------+--- output                               |input 2 --/\\/\\/\\/\\-------------+                               |input 3 --/\\/\\/\\/\\-------------+--paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........  .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . . .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .    .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

Justa brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues on type A, B, and AB already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned occasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM schemeor something.  Thanx in advanced.---------->The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much likeswitching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called "class S"before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitablefor very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophileamp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year(to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problemswith layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-ableisolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one thatoperates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carveramps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit (I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, andI beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found thatit had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation onPSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw highcurrent at the zero-voltage crossings).

What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full> schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd> love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such> low volume :-)Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;that's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a linearly-regulated power supply would be considered the "filter" caps,coming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Althoughthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOTnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing toget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a"snubber" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intendedfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (ina somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce ahigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or"filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputsis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,which acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (PWM) fashion to control (by varyingthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, andtherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputsmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-lesstracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linearregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to varioussafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to beelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolatorto meet this requirement.While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in thesedesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer canbe ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor abad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all theenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn'tsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the imagination! :-)).I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errorsin the above.Bob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any othermyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  unobjectionable).

Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in partbecause of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structureof AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is justexactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of productsis that this matches a hardware optimization.A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) hasTWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/ANDgate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true andinverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERTgates (with your choice of internal connections between thevarious sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sumof products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimizationof logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you todo so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelistwith 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description ofa logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT softwaredoes this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expandingit all out, then simplifying.John Whitmore

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigsNot possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator forjust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slowdown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet    away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be    caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio    transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).   Good instructions are included with the chokes.   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.And please remember to be friendly when approaching yourlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperationand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (mostare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimesdealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghostpictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether ornot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part ofbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makersto take any precautions.Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators arerequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no morethan 10).  So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call startingwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even requiredto) and fire/police have other private ids.--Douglas S.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains inany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a referencepower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance whichshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohmsin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an acceptednotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance ofthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omittedreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notationsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.For power:  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )For amplitude  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except forthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notationconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.Common references for audio are:0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms0 dBV = 1 volt0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)0 VU = -10dBV(consumer gear line level)Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned usingthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is alldone to whatever reference is reasonable for the applicationor moment.Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linearimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, thepower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be donewith the above two identities and ohm's law.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave MedinPhone:(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

Old style wiringWhere do I buy stuff?Subject: Introduction/DisclaimersAlthough we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are notelectricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  Ifyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don'tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. NationalElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detailwith the electrical code, but we don't quote sectionssimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have theforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,however, do not.  Check your with your local buildingdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices inCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,your local electrical utility may also have special requirementsfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, thatwe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-familyresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercialestablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by differentrules.Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and insome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiaryof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.Lots of things are the same, including voltages, linefrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a numberof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we'venoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or``CEC''.Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is oftensmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by theNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directlyat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's thefull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridgededition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorizedcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's therecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook forthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --US$65 plus shipping and handling.Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made upof various government agencies, power utilities, insurancecompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every twoor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.Since each province publishes its own slightly modifiedstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSAstandard itself.  In this FAQ, "CEC" really means theappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ isderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20thedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16thedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, anattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electricalinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  InOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn'toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  Ihear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than theequivalent NEC publications.Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughoutthe province.Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.In some, they're not.  Check with your local electricalinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other'shomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to dowiring in "commercial" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)are usually considered "semi-commercial" or "commercial".  However,many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercialwiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you canfind one willing to supervise.If you do your own wiring, an important point:Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a betterjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,and it's you or your family that might get killed if you makea mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skillsand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations thatare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,and will impress the inspector.The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have toearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend yourtime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremelypicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to stripwires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspectorwon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And ittakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of12ga wire through your hand that way.Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10Cor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older typesbecome very brittle.Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a fewscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approveddevices) you need Robertson ("square recess") screwdrivers(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.For drilling a few holes, a 3/4" or 1" spade bit and 1/4" or3/8" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, orare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2" drill(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and3/4" or 1" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pullyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, evenin 90 year old hardwood timbers.Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if youinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screwswork well).For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife orordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart "combo stripper,crimper and bottle opener" types.  You should expect to pay$15 to $20 for a good "plier-type" pair.  It will have sizedstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it shouldbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in theblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  Thereare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren'tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping endsin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddlinginside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wireloops with a "loop former hole" on your wire stripper - moreaccurate.If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper forremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick theend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a"zipper", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to stripthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy toslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanleyutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibilitythat you'll gouge the conductors.For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's wellworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wireor the insulation.Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wiredoutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot moreexpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simplevoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulatedwire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they costabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires aredead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)and work well.  If you get more serious, a "audible alarm" type isgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been knownto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger ora length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competentwiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful forwrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the terminationscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (toprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outletthat has no cover plate).Subject: What is UL listing?The UL stands for "Underwriters Laboratory".  It used to bean Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independentand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipmentfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that meansthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirementsfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarilymean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, justthat it probably won't kill you.The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you arepermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that willlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response tothe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, inmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring componentused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiringmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/oroccupancy permits issued.Subject: What is CSA approval?Every electrical device or component must be certified by theCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold inCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be donewith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar tothe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval isrequired by law.Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approvedequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay theclaim.In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems tobe more a liason group between the CSA and insurancecompanies.Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers    Residential Wiring    by Jeff Markell,    Craftsman Books,    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.    Practical Electrical Wiring    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan    McGraw-Hill Book Co.    Wiring Simplified    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan    Park Publishing Co.Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NECrevision.  Which is currently 1990.Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called"Electrical Code Simplified".  There appears to be a versionpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into theappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to getthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answerquestions on the net ;-).It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book isavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit andinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other moremundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies notliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspectionsprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighborsor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or losetheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate yourhome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without apermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty aboutthis.If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is atfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damageclaims.In general, the process goes like this:- you apply to your local inspections office or building  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose  special conditions on you, require loading  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point  they will tell you which inspections you will need.- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to  have the panel and service connections inspected  before your power utility will provide a connection.  This is sometimes done by the local power authority  rather than the usual inspectors.- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a  "rough-in" inspection.- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,  you will need a "final inspection".Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.Do I have to upgrade?In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in somecases).  However, any new work must be done according to thelatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, youmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or allof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240One thing where things might get a bit confusing is thedifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage ofa circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117Vor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the samething...  In North America the utility companies are requiredto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since thereare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's notunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has droppedto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especiallyat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a numberof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them "110V" and"220V", except when actually saying what the measured voltage willbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.One thing that might make this a little more understandableis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110Vinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the deviceis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops thatlow.208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage betweenphases of a 3-phase "Y" circuit that is 120V from neutral to anyhot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase "Y"circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intendedto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...Subject: What does an electrical service look like?There are logically four wires involved with supplying themain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utilitypole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere. The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to wherethe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanicaction conductivity "breaks" (often between copper and iron pipe)).This is the "grounding conductor".  It is there to make sure thatthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wirenormally carries no current.One of the other wires will be white (or black with white oryellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.It is connected to the "centre tap" (CEC; "center tap" in theNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  Itis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (ofteninside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connectedanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system ina home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.These will be connected together, or connected to the neutralat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additionalgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the housewiring is unsafe and contrary to code.If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usuallybrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and arenot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only oneneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations (certain categories of separate buildings) you actually dohave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult yourinspector.The other two wires will usually be black, and are the "hot"wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer aswell.The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with eachother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to thewhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.This is either because the neutral and ground are connectedtogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and onewire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in somerare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V onlyservice).Subject: What is a circuit?Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.These connections are then used to supply power to selectedportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles andlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplyingpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - theyoften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing severalcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) isusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, orair conditioners.[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similarto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that thereare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutraland ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providingthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs insteadof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptaclesare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, butthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as tolocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this ispermissible.](1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,white for neutral, and bare for grounding.(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, abare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and groundwire.  Since the white is "hot" in this case, both the NEC and CECrequires that the white wire be "permanently marked" at the endsto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nailpolish or sometimes electrical tape.Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into thepanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some placesrequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is "frame ground",the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be analternative to GFCI protection.Subject: "grounding" versus "grounded" versus "neutral".According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the"grounding" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the greenor bare wire.  The word "neutral" is reserved for the white whenyou have a circuit with more than one "hot" wire.  Since the whitewire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside thepanel, the proper term is "grounded conductor".  However, thepotential confusion between "grounded conductor" and "groundingconductor" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you shouldnever use the bare wire as a "grounded conductor" or white wireas the "grounding conductor", even though they are connectedtogether in the panel.[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and groundseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]In the trade, and in common usage, the word "neutral" is usedfor "grounded conductor".  This FAQ uses "neutral" simply toavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use "neutral"too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some lightswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the powerto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  Forexample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should"trip", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  Assuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect thewiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that theequipment itself won't cause a fire.Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, therebyinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relativelyfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which havelarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can usea "time-delay" fuse (one brand is "fusetron") which will avoidtripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like aspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must bereplaced.Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  Theyusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latchedinto position against another contact.  When the current flowthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic stripheats up and bends.  By bending it "trips" the latch, and thespring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behavesimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer totrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With highoverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finitenumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrownwhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, whichdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used inplace of switches unless they are specially listed for thepurpose.Neither fuses nor breakers "limit" the current per se.  A deadshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes eventhousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, whichcan often cause severe damage.Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higherrisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usuallydue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contactscorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fusebeing installed, or the proverbial "replace the fuse with apenny" trick.Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have betterconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  Whena fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conductingpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,melted service wiring, through fires in the electricaldistribution transformer and having your house burn down.Breakers don't do this.Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permitfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit newfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the specialinserts to "key" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuseprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuseis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check thelabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanentlyinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell youif you need one.Subject: What size wire should I use?For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoidvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size formore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, organged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipateheat easily:GaugeAmps141512201030840665We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependenton the application and precise wire type.Subject: Where do these numbers come from?There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  Whenthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there ismore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you needhigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use inconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for longruns.Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smallerwire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on mostlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fitsone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using largerwire.Subject: What does "14-2" mean?This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductorsin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The secondthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - butremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  "14-2" means14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimesthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  Inthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.Usually carrying 220V with neutral.Subject: What is a "wirenut"/"marrette"/"marr connector"?  How are theyused?A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's usedto connect wires together.  "Marrette" or "Marr connector"are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist themtogether, then twist the wirenut on.Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist thewire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electricallysecure.There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should checkthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for thequantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers oryour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose ("linesman") pliers,and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimesit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure itgoes in the wirenut properly.Some people wrap the "open" end of the wirenut with electricaltape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector maytear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done becausea bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - insteadof taping it, the connection should be redone.Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measuresthe current current flowing through the hot wire and theneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, thepresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some otherpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis ofan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Anyof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breakingthe circuit.GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutralleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCIwouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hotlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping theGFCI happy.The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not beprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devicesdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can becovered by a single GFCI outlet.Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phaseoutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, orjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter wateror dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps andlaundry appliances.The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, thereis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage orbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if youhave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door tooutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you maywant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCIbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCIoutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher inCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does yourfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Doeswater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose asafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must rununattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIsare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim thatthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentarycurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that mostGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for noapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiringbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as thefirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker witha built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCIbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GEbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is onemajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branchcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need amulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending onwhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect sucha circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to usean oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, uselarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that onespecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don'treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the firstoutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outletin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  Butprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little"ground fault protected" stickers that come with it and markthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out whichoutlets are "downstream", simply by tripping the GFCI with thetest button and see which outlets are dead.Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on withouta good ground connection), they're intended to guard againstinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case ofthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's aninsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, theground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possiblytrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is notgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and ifyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Ofcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a verytiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replaceungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  Inparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else withexposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heatingelectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing willhappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;the resistance will be too high.  But if the case weregrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path toground...Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  PolarizationNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than theother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where thethe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want tohave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the rightway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and thenarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for thehot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.If not, you can usually figure out which is which by whichprong the terminating screw connects to.Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliancecircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplexreceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is morethan 24" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter widerthan 12" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets exceptin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuitsare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* beprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tabis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes tothe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When"carrying through" to another outlet, the neutral must bepigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutralconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnectfrom downstream outlets.Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent tothe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated inthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: insidestud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subjectto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes arewired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are severaldifferent categories of NM cable.BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or "AC" has aflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and isfairly resistant to damage.TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplasticsheath.Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cableis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outersurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25" (CEC & NEC)from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protectedfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form ofmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armoredcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,but this is technically illegal.]Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in theCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vaguereferences to "exposed to mechanical damage" in both the NECand CEC):    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable      or NM cable in flexible conduit to "jump" to the appliance.      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by      means of a 25mm/1" air space, or suitable insulation      material (a wad of fiberglass).    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.      Holes in joists or studs are considered "supports".      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,      it is permitted where "proper" support is impractical]    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring      to the "workmanship" clause, but this seems more honoured      in the breach...]    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or      similar finish.    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more      than 1m (39").Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, smallplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable toprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor throughthe insulation.BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered bysolid wall coverings.In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall ofa garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, aUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types offittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for thewire.Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you willneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks likevery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths ofconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See undergroundwiring section.] Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose.Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire throughfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructedby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for thisis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gassesfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US, except that Canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: "AC90" versus "AC".In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changesmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.There are very different requirements for mobile homes.Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anythingthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.Wire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,uncommon wire types or applications omitted)ConditionTypeCECNECExposed/Concealed dryplasticNMD90NMarmorAC90ACTECK90Exposed/Concealed dampplasticNMD90NMCarmorACWU90TECK90Exposed/Concealed wetplasticNMWU90armorACWU90TECK90Exposed to weatherplasticNMWUTW etc.armorTECK90Direct earth burial/plasticNMWU*UFService entranceRWUTWUarmorRA90TECK90ACWU90[* NMWU not for service entrance]Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cableonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the boxitself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plasticboxes don't use metal cable clamps.The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cablearmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must stillprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC alsorequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even fornon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one groundconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the otherhand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  Forexposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.Subject: Junction box positioning?A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessiblelater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junctionboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors mayget nasty.Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a fewcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperagerating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing halfa dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wireback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtleconstraints as well.  For example, older housewiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excessheat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause theinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for hightemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that yourceiling wiring already has this problem, in which casereplacing any devices is a real adventure.)Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for somefluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box andits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavychandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new boxspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceilingjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also availablethat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole andmounted between the joists.There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as"pot" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulatedceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulatedceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a "coffin" (usually8'x16"x12" - made by making a pair of joists 12" high, and coveringwith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*long)NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn'tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspectorrequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't getaccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blownin later.]There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts andfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They areusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhatmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you shouldensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed locationfor the sensor can vary.There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approvedfor use in insulation.  The "coffin" appears the only legal approach.Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel isloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end upbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, withrespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it candestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and insome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictionsrequire the stove frame connected to neutral).If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediatelyand have them come and check out the problem.Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal withlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  Aloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightnessfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?Three phase power has three "hot" wires, 120 degrees out ofphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motorsbecause it is more "efficient", provides a bit more starting torque,and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts betweenany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between thetwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usuallyridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment youwant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper tobuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it ispossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you havea "capacitor start" unit, or use a larger motor as a(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution ifthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big toreplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has anarticle on how to do this if you must.Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by usingsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, thereis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supplywiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 timesless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This alsomeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motorwill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, thesmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are morethan 50 feet long.Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rationalefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most routermanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is farin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a "stallhorsepower" or similar.  That means the power is measured whenthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.What they don't mention is that if you kept it in thatcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breakerwill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing farmore current than it can continuously.When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  Thisshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,check the amperage rating, which is always present.Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles insteadof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safetyground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neitherthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.There are several different approaches to solving this:    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can       run a conductor to it from the third prong.    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath       on BX cable.The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a threeprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?Should the test button work?We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there'sa resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINEside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Currentthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't requirea real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you pressthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentiallydangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the groundwire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  Thecauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with theformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was nevertested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the devicebehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungroundedoutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs arelabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technicianwas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not requireit, and promised to investigate.)Subject: How should I wire my shop?As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for alldevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifiesthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of thecircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit forthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector orshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools havebig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 ampbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacleswhich means you'd have to "replug" all your equipment.  Lightsshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not sharedwith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least twoseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid asituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousandRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in thebeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at eachpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the sametime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes andplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may haveobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bitwrong.Note that some jurisdictions have a "no horizontal wiring"rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are usedfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must berun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220Vcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if youcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiledextension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire ofthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as muchheat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shopwiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want toequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able tohandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinishedbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  Andeven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shopoutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house mighthave a different idea.Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shopwiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.Subject: Underground WiringYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, usespecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastictubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rotsthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosionof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire isgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specificallylisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersionin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  Andof course, don't forget the GFCIs.The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction tojurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector aboutyour specific situation.A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says "buried powerline" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.Subject: Aluminum wiringDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring becamequite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for newwiring.But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminumwiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improperinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potentialproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as"cold creep".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  Whenit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goesthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness eachtime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodeswhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistanceof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly evencause a fire.Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they moveinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points ofsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasinga home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that youhire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiringfor the following things:    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will       be stamped with "Al/Cu" or "CO/ALR".  The latter supersedes       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat       more expensive than the ordinary ones.    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug       up each connection.       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.    3) "push-in" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with       the proper screw connections immediately.    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,       melted insulation, or "baked" fixtures.  Any such damage should       be repaired.        5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be       connected together using special crimp devices, with an       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless       you can rent the tool.    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring       by means of a short copper "pigtail".  See (5) above.        7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped       (not nicked) wire etc.    If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiringshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can considerthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - havingthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.You can do this yourself too.Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hirean inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If aninspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minorones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after anyminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in manyplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.Here's some hints on what to look for:Obvious non-code wiring can include:- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without  proper marking.- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of  a GFCI)- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)- Switched neutrals- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevinesCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at onetime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps   not properly terminated wiring)- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when  it's *really* convenient ;-)- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or  ceiling- Backwrapped grounding wiresSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiringIn the years since Edison "invented" electricity, several differentwiring "styles" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home youmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called"knob and tube" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors witha cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structuralmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connectionswere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrappingwith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runsdown the centre of each room, with "taps" off to each fixture.The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In somecases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the samecolour as the hot wires.You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.Comments on K&T:- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in  quite good condition.- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on  any circuit.- Building code does not permit insulation in walls  that contain K&T.- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be  tricky.  Consult your inspector.- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn'tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you shouldwatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it andbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectlyreasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures onnew circuits using modern techniques.After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first typeyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looksmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff wasused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawbackis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen wholesystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off ata touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous ifthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched asmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a severalhour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrinktubing.After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazardand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to bereplaced - it should be considered as safe as the "modern" stuff -thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.Subject: Where do I buy stuff?Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Theirprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores orDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider varietyincluding the "odd" stuff, and have people behind the counter thatknow what you're talking about.

I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively largecommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out anothertransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends tomake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using anHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to DC.Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I wouldappreciate it.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on morecomplex events where you need to understand how the scope isactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scopein "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent timebeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay tothe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual samplingrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture butbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHzsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose frontend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important forequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case reallyonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a singlesample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to getuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope forgeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage forlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capabilityof the scope.

Since we apparentlydon't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installingcameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial testsare going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with thevideo being piped into a command center they're buildingsomewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers orcheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but largemulti-colored status displays will show the various routesusing different colors to represent the various average speedsfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in frontof the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal trafficstatus to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently alsolooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated toproviding continuous audio from this system.In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent displayboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with dataon traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that thesystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from itwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system issimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read"cheap").We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAPaudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbalreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehiclereceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next isapplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using someother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting yourstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go stationjumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehiclereceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthlyfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receiversdon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completelytrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the systemup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  Youmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothingmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get moreinfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.Cheers,Alan<acooney@netcom.com>

I'dlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability touse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automationconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up controlcircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when thecue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's oneproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to bea sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solidcuetape!)Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relayfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relayis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuitof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figuredout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!Thanks,Mark Fontana--  "Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

Thedetector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on theroof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and how much from the rest of the module.

There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scannedimages of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it forsomething it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expandthe data base to handle more types of stuff.These systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and getmonthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back tothem so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay ayearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.If you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on apage-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You canalso print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Pageprinting takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dumpthe 5 or 6 pages you usually need.I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data availableto all Internet users.    :-)  -dave-- Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                        37N 17.382    121W 59.190

Ifyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and willnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance ofthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was foran officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Manylaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RFfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!" But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the policeare writing citations right and left for people using radardetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he hadfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it wasthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at ornear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep mefrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when myspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radardetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (whichis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend toobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind onlyworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwaveenlightment may be necessary.So, the questions are -  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector  antenna?

There are two precision levels, one  for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with  an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  Your original signals.

How are the relays connected to what you are driving?> > Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranferthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentaryopening and closing of the path.The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In highimpedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristicimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfersthe audio.In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs areshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristicimpedance.Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is usedto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make beforebreak and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consistsof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp isoff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowerspassing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varyingthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters andyou have a mixer!Lots of luck!-- 73, Tom================================================================================Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he callsthe rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when thekey is down.My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it'sastonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine withthe hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the distributor pickup.  Very poor design.I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willingto help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference iswasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not puttingout in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the differencebetween a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, areusually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operationwhen you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation whenyou inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving detailsand addresses).>Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.

Two things to watch for:   In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some   of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the   phone can be set to pulse dialing.   In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits   are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and   in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.   Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign   phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.   OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course   illegal.As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecomoperators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMFdialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't havebeen retrofitted with "magic fingers" that converts from DTMF to pulsedialing.Thomas--Real life:      Thomas Trnblom           Email:  Thomas.Tornblom@Nexus.Comm.SESnail mail:     Communicator Nexus AB     Phone:  +46 18 171814                Box 857                   Fax:    +46 18 696516                S - 751 08 Uppsala, Sweden

Also, H2SO4is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation ofPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,>is exothermic, or energy discharging.As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).(More about this later.)What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two thingshappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitatein a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course thishappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  Ifthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but theyare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restorethe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success withthese products for a newer battery.[stuff deleted]>To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on>concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's>Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will>act to move to a more comfortable position.

A logical consequence of the above argument is this:"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to -50 to 'pull' the reaction along."  We all know from experience (at least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this isnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warmthe battery.(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool during storage.)Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!

The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a biggertown, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.And regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that doesjust apply to pulsdialing.

Severalpeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated exactly what I am looking for.I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a hostvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and requireabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lotsof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to beinterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to usean 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROMneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytesto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much forthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UARTbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.Rich

I had a crew of a dozen ladies whichcould stuff and hand solder a board like lightning!Board under the mask was the original query.BTW cheap inport electronic devices (mainly from 3rd world countries) are donewith brown pheonolic boards.  Is seems the electronics industry has discoveredthe cheap labor pools.  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits athome.  They are very obviously hand soldered.  Quite a few tape recorders arebeing brought into Canada from Red China.  In China there is no warranty forthe equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours.  One of myco-workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box wasalmost 50%.Also, the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regularprinting press.  An old lithographer friend had a press for this.  After theetching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors.> -- 73, Tom================================================================================Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.
