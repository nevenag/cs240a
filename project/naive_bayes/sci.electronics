 37HELP!!  This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!

 30A couple of weeks ago, I was asking for a public domain schematic editorwhich is compatible with SPICE and runs under X.I got several e-mails and therefore I wrote this summary:It seems that there are two public domain tools available.The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at  hobiecat.caltech.edu orin europe at ifi.uio.no. In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  itself iscalled LOG.The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSIpackage. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.  Itshould be available at Berkley.That's all I got so far.Mark__________________________________________________________________________ _____Mark NiederbergerEmail:   mniederb@itr.ch__________________________________________________________________________ _____

All bar one of these are operational - that one failedand has never been repaired because it was no longer needed.The 7A22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high-and low- pass filters. There is _nothing_ on the market, to myknowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.All of the above have service manuals.
 6These circuits abound in most electronic project books.  If you're moreinclined to buy something, try Radio Shack.  I think they still have adevice that is designed to disconnect an answering machine when anextension line is lifted.  It has LED indicators also. --kyler

 21I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software forantenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations(though good PC software would also be of interest).I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN forsome time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz)designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as wellas for your basic thin wire assumption.Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  I've seen a versionthat was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but I'm notsure how many "new and improved" versions of the code might be out theresomewhere.I'd also be interested in non-NEC derivatives.  The ones I've seen havebeen aimed at microwave applications, but if there is something out thereuseful at the lower frequencies, I'd like to know about it.Thanks,-- Don Rice                   E-mail: ddr@flux.isr.alaska.edu    (Internet)Geophysical Institute              fnddr@alaska               (BITNET)University of Alaska               flux::ddr                  (SPAN)Fairbanks, AK 99775        Phone:  (907) 474-7569        Loran: 64.86N 212.16E

 18I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciatesome net.wisdom.His question is about some 18-24" diameter balls which are attached toelectric power lines in his area.  He's seen up to a half dozen betweentwo poles.  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize theinductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.Anyone know what they really are?  Is there a related FAQ for this?Is there a better group to submit to?We'd both appreciate some enlightenment.-- Scott Townsend,  Sverdrup Technology Inc.

If you have an idea about its voltage and current ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON" at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to experiment with various gain-altering techniques.Bill Willis     willisw@coe-nw.clemson.edu(803) 656-5550

Strictly,a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output changestate, according to the inputs.A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine whichof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there arethree inputs required.A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enableinput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, alloutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) outputwill be low).An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) toselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve youraim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Notethat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, sinceyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) leftonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plusa mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, usethe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide thefour enable lines.Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to thefour final stage decoders.Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power ampchips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to theinput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to bothchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to anoutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be goodenough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone andbalance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs ofthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably before the other controls).  If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you shouldprobably forget the whole thing. --- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CAInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055

Carpenter) writes:>>> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the>> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?>>Yes. It's called RADAR.Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distancesby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive itsreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimetersuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case ofthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500feet altitude.Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the posteroriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements betweena transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accuratetime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmittertriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actuallytravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the differenceis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to acommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Somethinglike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering boththe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where againthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.should know about anyway ;-).>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength>> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),>> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmittervaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmissionline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unitover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. Withthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located atone place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base forthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in>a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this>concept.Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unlessthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...>> What frequencies would be best for this?

 40Hi,Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II undermy belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:Ai [Current Gain]Av [Voltage Gain]Ap [Power Gain]or whatever.I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, butI would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the partslist has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 magso it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement inthe latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I couldfigure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for Highpower amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse thanI started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yetgood gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me?

Returnedit six times for various and never the same problems.  Got tired of taking it back and fixed it myself.  The Hi-Fi "window" was a bit off.  Something likethe Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning.  When I was a Wal-Mart "associate" in '88-'89,we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY.  How's that forreliability?  Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premiumquality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with reliability IMHO.  Please, no flames.

Anyidea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).W/my 0.02Prasadprasadr@vtvm1.cc.vt.edu
 26Message-ID: <1993Apr15.165322.1@novax.llnl.gov>NNTP-Posting-Host: novax.llnl.govI've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So Ihave one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter acrossthe red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on mysecond line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the firstline. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the secondline(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on thered and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming infrom the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment andwent back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines readopen.I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?Guy UrbinaUrbina@novax.llnl.gov

 22One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMGchannels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably besufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz perchannel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing shouldbe rather easy to accomplish.Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do withoutgenerating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner isin a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult tokeep balanced.A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed witha little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever lawsgovern the use of transeivers in your location.-- Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED

 28Hi,I am looking for some help in choosing a packagefor a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to testthe chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speedtesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip. I know for sure that a DIP will not work(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, soI am trying to choose between a flatpak and aleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hardto test since it has to be soldered on to the testsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chipcarrier sockets also have long lead lines and maynot work at high speeds. Does anyone out there have experience/knowledgeof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packageswould help.  P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bitof overkill(?) --- Seema Varma

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment isALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it takes a while).If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screwthings up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DCon charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time whenyou "need" it.Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at leastSOME of this helped.

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, Iask this again:1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies   hole currents over normal electron currents?3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).NOTES:   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole   particles only exist in the presence of matter.   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such   currents *if* they exist.   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.Thanx,Eric.---- ET   "A Force of Nature"----

Anyone seen this before?What is happening is this:1) You turn the TV on.2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.Things to check:First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the verticaloutput transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The mostcommon cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawnsomewhere.Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillatorthen it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

 23Tony Wayne writes:>What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments?>-tonyPink noise is a random signal with more low-frequency componentsthan white noise.If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequencyanalyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, whichmeans that every frequency is present in the noise signal.Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-passfiltering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much morelow-frequency components.The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaringanimals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency willexplain you why.Enjoy it.Wouter.

He's probably busy with his next release.)-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tim Pillsbury          Internet:  tsp@ccd.harris.com                          uunet:  uunet!ccd.harris.com!timothy.pillsbury-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31Nntp-Posting-Host: picasso.synoptics.com    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of mileson your electronic odometer with an oscillator....    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW areputting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostileenvironment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.   If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )         * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:                                This is a car, not an electron.         *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be                                        electrical noise or contact bounce    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out ofa BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in themiddle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).    I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it'sprobably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all,a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be anapp note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into thisin good detail.                               - Jerry Kaidor ( tr2!jerry@dragoman.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com )                                  - Jerry Kaidor

If the ground connections on the outlets areconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to themain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house groundrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one ofthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hotto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.

 37HELP!!  This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for aconstant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have preciselythe same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constantprecentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whosebandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constantbandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whosebandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as "1/3octave" or "1/2 octave" or some such terminology).White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3db/octave).-- |                Dick Pierce                ||    Loudspeaker and Software Consulting    || 17 Sartelle Street   Pepperell, MA  01463 ||       (508) 433-9183 (Voice and FAX)      |

This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligiblyless than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a littledepending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio orthe availability of parts.Hows that sound?---Joel KolstadP.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can beaccurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well askeeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

 21         On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable.                  What could the problems be and what else could I useto lower the input voltage?  (btw I've got it grounded correctly)    _________________________________________________  Inspiration  |   ___                             |  comes to     |  \\   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |  seek the     |   /-\\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |  unknown.     |                                   |  -------------------------------------------------

 22I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke-87 multimetersuggests applying WD-40 to the test lead sockets, especially thecurrent range socket.  The intention is to prevent thetest-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when thereis no test lead in that socket.The manual is a bit vague, but I think I'd apply the WD-40 to aswab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directlyfrom the can.Speaking of said meters:  I compared the 87 against the 8060A thatI've had on my bench for almost 11 years.  It has been five yearssince the 8060A has been calibrated.  On the DC scale, they agreewithin .01 mV.  AC scale is within about .1 mV.  The 87 would bejust about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; Ididn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since Idon't use dB all that much in my work.-- Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED

Some involvemodifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing havebeen successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of newways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The factis, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more orless difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if notimpossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a goodone for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you tryingto crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption offiles which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copyprotected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas forpractical applications, and are merely curious?Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as Ican.Incidentally, the "Uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dreadanyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feelswhen they are asked how to hack.

Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment(octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the sameamount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave.    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment(Hz, kHz, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount ofnoise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide).    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octavefilter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs).Note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network :-(    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)as a flat line across the bands.DaveP

 20Nntp-Posting-Host: autarch.acsu.buffalo.eduHI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo relatedsubjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recievingcircuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confusedabuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillatorfrequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (assimple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across aMC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs(ACTIVE,etc...) Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyonemay have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILEDELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot ofcircuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.Thanks,Mark Musone

GANDLER) writes:>>How does the radio Electronics free information cards work.>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a>catalog. That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertisergets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readerswho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data onself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide thedata on computer disk.The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You willnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly calleda "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company nameand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, nationaladvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals asbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your companyand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probablysend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineercall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are theywill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retailoutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you the whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, havenothing to mail out accept the catalog.A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industrymagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. Theyuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do readthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or pushyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compilehow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readersrequesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, somemagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. Forexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested informationabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazinesinclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, theadvertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" fromthe serious potential customers."Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of  weeks later.  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data  on a computer printout.  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're  not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every  other month and circle two or three numbers.  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.  Advertisers almost never call.

Thesensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force fordraft generation.It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used onboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used parttime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typicallytakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

When will people learn!The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to contact the ballast. Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and counting)  TC.

 43Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulatorsand learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies...(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with prettygood results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problemswhen I try to design & build anything that puts out seriousamps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on mybench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding forthe usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to looseme... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a fullschematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'dlove to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from suchlow volume :-)My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on myown (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take anycourse that covers transistors ;-)So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercialmodels and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not whatI'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematicsand a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? Take care.P.S.

 19I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU.I have the Motorola MC68030UM/AD Rev. 1, but I fear it is out of date as itdoes not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi.What I need is the Theta (JC) Thermal Characteristic (the Junction to Casethermal resistance) for the _PLASTIC_ FE style package.If you have this info, I would appreciate your sending it by email as postingssuffer a few days delay here.If you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate valuefor the typical power dissipation. I'm assuming 2.25 Watts (using the 2.6 Wmaximum at 0 C decreased the way the Pd drops in the 6801x as Ta increases).If your manual has a chart of power dissipation, I'd like to know what itreads at 25 C and 40 C.Thanks for reading!James MacPhail  jmacphai@cue.bc.ca  (on bounce try james@mirg2.phy.queensu.ca)

 163Sender: news@adx.adelphi.edu (USENET News System)Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NYDate: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 08:46:08 GMTThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and groundingpractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, orthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  Itshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry thenormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the groundingconductor.  Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the groundingconductors to provide reliable operation  ("orange" outlets are often used forthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and inmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should readboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulatedgrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the serviceentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not providea safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which isreferred to in the code as the "identified" conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrancepanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many householdservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  Inthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the groundingconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipmenthas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the "U"ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does notpresent a shock hazard.  HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, youwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire ofinadequate size, causing it to overheat.With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, oftencausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path backto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of itflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the "hot" conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, notit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at anysub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperatewire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the daysbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want tohave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in placeof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings(since most current is in the 220 volt "hots" except at some low settings, thewires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,it's primarily for lightning protection.People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal groundingconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in "romex" 'with ground' is.  Anywherethere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bondinglocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  "Greenfield" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't havethe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield."Wiremold" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact, and the "feed" to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were "hot" with120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can "bond" the wire to thebox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outletswhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have theprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don'tinstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It isdesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungroundedGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might berenumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much moreto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

OK ?Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.         It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry          conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find         a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one          side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the          energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of         energy that carnot will give them.         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent         radioactive pollution of the environment !            -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.    -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have         1.5 mRem.

In our case, othermonitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to bespecific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit thisproblem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etcseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but thejuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other sideof wall maybe?We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable inputlines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interferenceeffect on the computer monitor next to it. Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (verycommon, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection typeO'scopes).I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mountaround deflection coil of interfering monitor. BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGHVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'TBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TOMOUNT CAN.Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is alsogood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield onmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those othersources.Jeff Babbbabb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.eduProgrammer, SDSU - LARC

A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the gameGODS and asked me for help since he could not find a "trainer" (smallpatch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed butI did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* filewould not affect the decompression and would also prevent the "shield" in thegame from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way oranother and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copyprotection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possiblycompressed), dongles, key disks, etc...I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protectionschemes.>--> Michael Chen| From the depths of our most lucid horrors |>| spring our fond hopes and pure desires... |> mchen@cs.psu.edu| except what comes from HELL! :-) 7/23/92  |-- Alex T.

Raw HC11 parts have factory setROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts haveEEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them userprogrammable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. Themore expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dipvarieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposingthe EPROM array to light.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14When constructing active filters,  odd values of resistor are often required (i.e. something like a 3.14 K Ohm resistor).(It seems best to choose common capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up sucha resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade?.(1,1.2,1.5,1.8,2.2,3.3 etc ).  It is a common enough problem,  yet I cant recall seing a program that tells that Rx+Ry//Rz gives Rq,  starting with q and finding prefered values x,y and z.CheersIan H

Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "TheHungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat sourceis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box withventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the airto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks arespaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Useyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens maynot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins orracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on myoven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick awooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and closethe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allowsfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check itoften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you areusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfwaythrough.If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right subfor this stuff.gerald.belton@ozonehole.com * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.                       ----The Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-31423 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 FilesSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet NewsgroupsPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com
 8NNTP-Posting-Host: hardy.u.washington.eduI have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressedindividually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so).  Is there an LSI thatis designed to drive an LED array (including RAM to hold the array state),or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so I don't have tolatch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch?  (I want to avoid havinga huge board covered with 373s if possible!)  Thanks in advance...Phil Torre (ptorre@u.washington.edu)

I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip numbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, which will do you NO good for reading in.            Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.  In pascal, you would "Write(Port[xxx]);" where xxx is the address in either hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, do "Port[xxx]:=value".                 Hope this helps.        Let me know if you need more help.    _________________________________________________  Inspiration  |   ___                             |  comes to     |  \\   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |  seek the     |   /-\\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |  unknown.     |                                   |  -------------------------------------------------

 26We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. Wewould like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms betweenfirings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the samedirection. To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A thatcorresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT lineof sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at thetime the init line of sonar B is activated. We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supplyfor sonars B and C. Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units andthis type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatlyappreciated.-- Caglan M.

I forget exactly how wide the polylines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probablyomit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a highresistance it can be ignored at these speeds).4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run withslightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially foroutput signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big fora MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as Ineeded.

Is this true?I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no  amp which can touch it at the price range.The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other   amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components   in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the  amplifiers sound so brilliant.I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded  like new.If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.--*************************************************************************    Alan Webber                                                    ****                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          ****                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          ****                                                                   **** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    *************************************************************************

 14I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance tube tester for a song. Unfortunately, I was a little out ofkey; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement.Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movementlike it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cutand paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what thefull scale current was.

 43Much deleted about assembly in USA vs. other, I wish to focus on the subject of warm-running amplifiers:> : >  Sure the amp runs very fairly> : >  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.> > : An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.> : The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.> > : because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted> : to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....> There is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound,or in your words, "it DOES have a bearing on....".Now, I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combinationstove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan,but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperaturevariation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  And sincejunction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimentaleffect on linearity.  a few facts:-bias points vary with temperature-junction resist varrie with temp-Adcom products do NOT run class-AIf you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirementsfor most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifierwarm-up.  On many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes forthe output stage, many hours for the drivers.  Fortunately the driversare not switched.In any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening,betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias(idle current) level.  Both have a positive correlation with lowdistortion and "good" sound quality, and high bias results inwarmer operation, all other factors being equal.Grant

 14Once upon a time, long long ago in this news group, someoneposted a schematic for a 1-bit A/D converter.  Well I just found a usefor the little monster.  Anyone out there still got this text file?It had a flip-flop, a resistor and a cap, and a comparator/op-amp I think.

 16We have a Sun CD-ROM drive which I would like to play audio CD's in.I have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to ajunk "Walkman" style AM/FM radio. This amp ties the common path of theearphone connection to ground.However, it doesn't work with my Sony Walkman cassette player, or the CD drive,it produces of loud low-frequency tone. Obviously Sony doesn't groundthe earphone output common. Does anyone have specs on the CD drive's output? Will an audio transformer help?

In demonstrating it ata presentation to audio engineers, this was impressive enough thatthe people present were bugging them about where they could buy them.Anyway...I want to build some to use as "choir mikes" (wide coverage).I've had good luck using some small electret mike elements I gotfrom Digi-Key - most of these are limited-bandwidth, peakey unitsbut for a buck or two more I got the ones spec'd to go out to 20kHzwith a bit flatter response.  The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind ofcritical.  I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, whichputs the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mountingit with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at asmall clearance.

But one is also connected to everygrounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment pluggedinto isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happensto accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on ituntil the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolatedground will remain relatively noise-free.

Also, make sure that yourprogram can not be run out a debugger.Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk withgarbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk insome random sector.Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but theyare both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is theopposite of what you want.Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of themachine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you canthink of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, itrequests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk shouldbe encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anythingelse you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Onceagain, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRCchecks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among otherthings, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects achange in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in theprogram.  Tell them the program is "VIRUS SECURE", and remember, you havehelped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.

 26I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to mycpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistorto the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie mycpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistorof 47k.It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulsesthat occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't therise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I shouldbe able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpuand to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm notdoing anything high-speed.In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of thephototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve thespeed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate theresistor value?-- Paul Malenfantpmalenfa @ kitkat.webo.dg.com (508-870-6460)

 40       Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board since 9pm.  It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem 1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It would shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've been trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried PNP's, still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 pkg type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) manyfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations wereadopted ("why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.").  3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generallynot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossilplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about "thermal >pollution" de-icing a river, said, "Up here, we view heat as a resource".  Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plantsof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible inorder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure isnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It isdesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocitycauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowestpressure condensing environment is always the best.  A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (wherethe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since thecondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash intosteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is aparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at allcosts.  The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plantin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get inthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term isused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling towersystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river wateris pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higherhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce thecondenser area.At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in theair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the dischargewater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge waterfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature andhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river watertemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical"95-95" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successfulin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for theplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature getstoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessivepressure.>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than >cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity andfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understoodthe costs of impure water.  By "impure", I mean water with a fewdozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolvedoxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory.John-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

A continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that needshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magneticfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,like a Faraday cage.The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be areal problem (one that bit me once).

Supposedly, the government rethought thissoon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF oftheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space isquickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that whichtravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,the published data showed that when noise drowned out regularreception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of theman who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methodswere correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".---- ET   "Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes."----

A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their servermodels.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  Thereused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase inTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME busesthough.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, butI think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.Cheers,Corwin

You'll probably find thatit already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren'tbeing used.  A couple of cables and you're in business.Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VDoutputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to thecameras.If neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a syncseparator.

 19Dear NettersI want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on eachrunning person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use isabout 150MHz and about 440MHz.To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-units i need.On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers as needed in the particular case.DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?baldur@rsp.is     (TF3BP) (please respond by email rather than nn)

Any one determined enough to break copyprotection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entireload-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to makesuch attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.

 30A couple of weeks ago, I was asking for a public domain schematic editorwhich is compatible with SPICE and runs under X.I got several e-mails and therefore I wrote this summary:It seems that there are two public domain tools available.The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at  hobiecat.caltech.edu orin europe at ifi.uio.no. In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  itself iscalled LOG.The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSIpackage. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.  Itshould be available at Berkley.That's all I got so far.Mark__________________________________________________________________________ _____Mark NiederbergerEmail:   mniederb@itr.ch__________________________________________________________________________ _____

 32Sci.E(E) netters:I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 1000-10,000.Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part number, or when they do look around for something in their line they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in quantity.I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.-Joe Bettsbetts@netcom.comP.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else had better luck with this strategy?

There is no difference whether the output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision copy protection.)In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.It is a pretty lame scare tactic.

This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively >protecting software.There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure theuser is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way isfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a differentmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (dependson the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's conscience should do that.I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of "casual"users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights(It's the truth.  I have "friends" who ask me for copies of my latest gamesall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casualpirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection willdiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my "friends" dug upsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actualrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disablethe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determinedpirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked oncefound by authorities.  It is the "casual" pirates that the copy protection isdetermined to discourage.What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plusa special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above.Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating andmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message isencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides astable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thusviolated their license agreement.This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as onlyproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and thereforegains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?--Kasey Chang

 90There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printersavailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet andpossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide withrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the rightside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have agray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allowyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be informationpackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed acoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the newcapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed findthat the cartidges now last longer.I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting yournearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanicalcomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer andthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my originaldesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You arelikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a newdeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading anoriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but nosoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swappingthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HPservice center for further information.The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different fromthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laserprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send araster end command after each scan line.  This makes no materialdifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print theaccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideouslyslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers arestill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfectworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect worksefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression thatpermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only onemegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large asabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory forits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support bandedprinting that allows incrmental download of the image withcompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadablefonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  Thisis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjetprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printerhas completed its warm-up cyle.Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in imagedeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, butmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate theproblem.Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumablecomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy wastecould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowingstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in thelaserjet IV.Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphoussilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The imagedrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very niceprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also hasa neat modular paper source and stacker system.The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lowerthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers aresubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  Theusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is asingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport isalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  Ifyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with theappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.-- Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED

TTL?ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's alongwith PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to namea few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as longas you adhere to sound engineering practices.  A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System DesignHandbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is consideredto be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.The very fact that you need to build a test fixture meansyou're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itselfhas far more inductance per pin than the package you aretesting, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  Idon't see the big concern over the packaging because itprobably isn't going to make that much differenceIf you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.:-(aaronP.S.

I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won'tcopy the program if "diskcopy" can't do it.If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything thatwill beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, willsuffice.I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster andand convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a backup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,so you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a wasteof time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend"out the backups. No flames intended - just my thoughts.Eric
 29Hmmm...  A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have thedistributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks itin the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which weresent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order totrack in store piracy.Possible additional program security schemes would be:1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in   and registration. (inconvenient)2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness)4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or   memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc.    (only as effective as above methods at best.)5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked    copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably   illegal, certainly immoral)my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thoughtif I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.What is the problem with parallel port security keys? I haven't used anythingthat had hardware key copy protection schemes, so I don't know what thedrawbacks are. I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable,but I've seen cracks of AutoDesk 3d-studio floating around (I don't have oneso don't ask) and I had heard that it had parralel port keys.vamilliron@othello.ucd.edu-my apologies if I rambled, but vi inhibits my communication skills greatly.

(I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  Theeasiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of theboards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boardscould all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don'tdecide to talk at the _exact same time_.Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to "something"that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as itused to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPSor slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplexthe data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the firstparagraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk morethan 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to beable to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,though.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4RS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.---Joel Kolstad

We did not do so.One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps!Knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor technique of RESECTION to determine robot location. (No, I ain't going toexplain resection over the net.)Given hindsight, I would digitize the amplified output of the self-nullingphototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves atthe several expected frequencies, to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon.By doing this at the numerous steps, even with  8 degree steps, with knowledgeof the angular response of the phototransistor, you SHOULD be able torather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.Allen Sullivan

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basicallymodified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weightof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM fortheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but Iwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hackingwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM intoa RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way tobackup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games couldbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load theminto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've gottwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsacartridges.

Thatcould be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back aspecially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions:Limit the size of data that the program can work with,Disable saving the data,Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them assuch)Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is startedand/or exitedetc....but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.--einari@rhi.hi.is

In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more resistive.Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.  TC.

 18What are people's opinions about laser detectors?  Escort makes alaser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However,I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if youare lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car infront of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to yourdetector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travelsin all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buytheir wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'llsave $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition ofthe laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport1000 normally costs $100).--Eddie GornishUniversity of Illinois - Center for Supercomputing Research & Developmentgornish@csrd.uiuc.edu

 18Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a "boxer" type fan by installinga capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow ofsmall 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with workingvoltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study isusually required to experimentally determine the best sizecapacitor for a given application.For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It isexceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.

 27Hi,I am looking an integrated circuits for my Z80-based computer.The circuit is called Z80-STI (Serial Timer Interrupt), MK3801, andmade by Mostek. Mostek is called SGS Thompson today. I have been in contact with SGS Thompson, unfortunately they me told that Z80-STI is obsolete. So, my question is if anyone know if I can get hold of that circuits. Are there any companies that specialize in selling circuits that are no longer in production? I have contacted several electronic brokers inSweden, but without any success. I would appreciate if you could give me hint where I should continue looking. Even companies in the United States would be fine, since this circuit is pretty crucial to me.  Thanks in advance.

This would save time and money for theIC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to sendaround the world via internet and since most users ofIC'sare found in the internet anyway.  Are there any books available for purchase that reference(as many as possible)?

After a while wegot round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the lastguy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 voltbus.   But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a lot of them got "funny" in the LCD display.  A black stain wouldspread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from thoseZebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, thelow-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with silicone).   What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges orturn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit ofclever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the worldsafer for electricans, anyway.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mVIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower thanthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expectinside a PC.Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a lowdistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  DigitalDomain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitizedwaveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor onthe spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking atthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) completesampling A/D with DSP interface.

 23Hello there.  The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thoughtabout constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  I figured onsubstituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding theantenna coil, etc., myself.The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuningcapacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers whichused to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem tobe all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmercapacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for thisapplication.So, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 0--360 pF range?Manythanks.-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------Greg Neill,               | ounce (ouns), n. - The standard unit ofHNSX Supercomputers   Inc.|   prevention, equal to one pound of cure.gneill@cid.aes.doe.ca     |

It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it willself-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small loadsuch as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave iton constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to "shallow-cycle" the charge in the battery. Such mild "exercising" of a lead-acidbattery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte forstorage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storagecontainers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cellswhen you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new batteryin a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an olderbattery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   storage.-- =============================================================================Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX)      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.

 27Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, indefiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed outthousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops nearthe Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radardetector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I wouldimagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting aradar detector became difficult - if not impossible!As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA lawagainst radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effectiveJan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detectoraccessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detectorscream!

 55I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphicscard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also beable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to becheap.  My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; eachcompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - inputwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. Ineeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire thecompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but mycircuit would not detect it.   The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference thenthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  Infact the difference between completely black and completely white isonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify thevideo signals to make this work.  There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariatorwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supplycircuit.  At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistorcircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designingtransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Anyideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatlyappreciated.  Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, soI don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found away to take advantage of that fact.Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,you will have my undying gratitude.Steve Verity-- ..........>.........>........>......>...>...>..>..>..>..>.>.>.>>>>>>>>+ .

However, thisdoes not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copyingtheir circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.

So long as you draw your owndiagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warningthat the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible forhim to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someoneelse's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status isnot a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damagesa court would award.However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,almost certainly it is "obvious to one skilled in the art" and thereforeunpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.Caution:  I am not a lawyer.

The designerof the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have somesuggestions what I could do?

Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.   We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of  over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   "Pirate board" or no pirate board.  I too have "friends" who blatantly and  quite successfuly "hack" copy protection schemes practically in their  sleep.Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and "acting" similar to  the average user, and maintaining "behind-the-scenes" consistency is a  real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  disk.Often we have hardware problems at peak "business" times and have to do  some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with "copy  protection" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain   . .In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  legitimate user with a "copy protection" scheme!Sorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)Mark S.

 35I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks bybuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhileI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, thereseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans somerandom 50mV bias.The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn outputwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessedfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the inputimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits havemaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most haveinput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order touse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thingreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of mycircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but nowwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind ofa pain in  the ass.Is there any way I could make myself a little box that couldsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generatorinput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is somelow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factorof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'dlike to have this box not be active.Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons Ihad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. Thefunction generator was the same way on that one, too.please help as I am feeling very stupid today,dave dgj2y@virginia.edu

Is this correct?The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ videodigitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vgamonitor signal. However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assumeit would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector wouldbe highly appreciated!Please could you reply by email :ee90dhg@brunel.ac.ukbecause I am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modemis slow for reading news!

 6The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold.  The temperaturecombined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of the battery.  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn'tgo dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quitecooler.

The filtering is notinterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signalyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru anall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person'sheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaksthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with theproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken atthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but notunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with thingsin realtime if you write efficient code.In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody outthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line withresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me asthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.>Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective">sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency>antialiasing filters.

I would guess that it is acutally cheaper tofilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components andgive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that theycharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.

Making a bunchof these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make surethings won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at leastdefeats your approach.

Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOSinformation is going to change, at least the date anyway.

Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in thelong cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  Iwould suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on shortpeaks.You can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or trystrapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,which will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you'regoing to need a bigger generator.I assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched thevoltage output on the generator properly.

Thanks.Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connectingall your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so thesignal sources aren't driving directly into each other. Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixinghigh-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixingline-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.input 1 --/\\/\\/\\/ -------------+--- output                               |input 2 --/\\/\\/\\/\\-------------+                               |input 3 --/\\/\\/\\/\\-------------+--paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........  .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . . .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .    .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

Justa brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues on type A, B, and AB already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned occasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM schemeor something.  Thanx in advanced.---------->The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much likeswitching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called "class S"before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitablefor very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophileamp, though.

The Carveramps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit (I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, andI beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found thatit had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation onPSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw highcurrent at the zero-voltage crossings).

I'd> love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such> low volume :-)Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;that's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a linearly-regulated power supply would be considered the "filter" caps,coming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Althoughthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOTnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing toget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a"snubber" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intendedfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (ina somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce ahigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or"filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputsis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,which acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (PWM) fashion to control (by varyingthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, andtherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputsmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-lesstracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linearregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to varioussafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to beelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolatorto meet this requirement.While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in thesedesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer canbe ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor abad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all theenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn'tsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the imagination! :-)).I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errorsin the above.Bob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any othermyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.

 16I would appreciate some help in locating a telephone controlled power barfor my PC. The unit would power up the PC when the telephone rings andkeep it up as long as the telephone connection is present.I also need to be able to power up this same PC through the use of an externaltimer. I can supply power or a contact closure to do this.I will summarize and post the results of this query here.Thank you.--Dan Gouldgould@waterloo.hp.com

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  unobjectionable).

Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in partbecause of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structureof AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is justexactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of productsis that this matches a hardware optimization.A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) hasTWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/ANDgate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true andinverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERTgates (with your choice of internal connections between thevarious sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sumof products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimizationof logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you todo so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelistwith 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description ofa logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT softwaredoes this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expandingit all out, then simplifying.John Whitmore

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigsNot possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator forjust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slowdown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet    away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be    caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio    transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).   Good instructions are included with the chokes.   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.And please remember to be friendly when approaching yourlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperationand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (mostare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimesdealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghostpictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether ornot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part ofbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makersto take any precautions.Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators arerequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no morethan 10).  So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call startingwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even requiredto) and fire/police have other private ids.--Douglas S.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains inany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a referencepower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance whichshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohmsin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an acceptednotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance ofthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omittedreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notationsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.For power:  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )For amplitude  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except forthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notationconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.Common references for audio are:0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms0 dBV = 1 volt0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)0 VU = -10dBV(consumer gear line level)Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned usingthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is alldone to whatever reference is reasonable for the applicationor moment.Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linearimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, thepower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be donewith the above two identities and ohm's law.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave MedinPhone:(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

 20I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively largecommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out anothertransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends tomake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using anHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to DC.Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I wouldappreciate it.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on morecomplex events where you need to understand how the scope isactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scopein "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent timebeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay tothe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual samplingrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture butbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHzsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose frontend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important forequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case reallyonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a singlesample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to getuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope forgeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage forlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capabilityof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes tofall...-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave MedinPhone:(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

 48I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it thatsomething similar is on its way here.  Since we apparentlydon't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installingcameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial testsare going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with thevideo being piped into a command center they're buildingsomewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers orcheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but largemulti-colored status displays will show the various routesusing different colors to represent the various average speedsfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in frontof the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal trafficstatus to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently alsolooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated toproviding continuous audio from this system.In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent displayboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with dataon traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that thesystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from itwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system issimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read"cheap").We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAPaudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbalreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehiclereceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next isapplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using someother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting yourstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go stationjumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehiclereceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthlyfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receiversdon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completelytrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the systemup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  Youmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothingmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get moreinfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.Cheers,Alan<acooney@netcom.com>

TIA registers also sat in this address space.As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carriedRAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write lineto the cart.

I'dlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability touse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automationconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up controlcircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when thecue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's oneproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to bea sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solidcuetape!)Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relayfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relayis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuitof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figuredout in your heads.

 15Hi !!!Is there somebody using a 56001 DSP from Motorola ???I am searching for programms concerning audio effects.I built a 4 channel mixer (4ADC + 1DSP) for audio signals.I built some digital filters and echos, but now i want toinclude some effects like HARMONIC Equalizer or chorus.The problem is, I dont know how these effects work (so I cantwrite a programm).So if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work,please contact me in the newsgroup or via e-mail.(Also if there are books about this problem)Thanks in advance(DWO)
 14 i need to get some info a.s.a.p. about the cellularantenna market out there right now:  who are the maincompanies making them, how much do they cost, what arethe specs (such as gain , directivity, etc.), and whois the contact person because a group of us here areat the Univ.of IL are researching into this technologyI will personally mail you a copy of our entire busineessplan and paper if you can be of any help..e-mail me at erini@enterprise.ifp.uiuc.edu

There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scannedimages of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it forsomething it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expandthe data base to handle more types of stuff.These systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and getmonthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back tothem so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay ayearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.If you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on apage-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You canalso print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Pageprinting takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dumpthe 5 or 6 pages you usually need.I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data availableto all Internet users.    :-)  -dave-- Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                        37N 17.382    121W 59.190
 50Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment orcontribution to:In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  Ifyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and willnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance ofthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was foran officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Manylaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RFfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!" But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the policeare writing citations right and left for people using radardetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he hadfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it wasthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at ornear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep mefrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when myspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radardetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (whichis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend toobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind onlyworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwaveenlightment may be necessary.So, the questions are -  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector  antenna?  Are any brands "quieter" than others?==============================================================================Randy T. Agee - ARS WB4BZX       | At some point, you probably pondered The P.O.

 13Last week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working withmy Sun CD-ROM drive. It turns out that the channel I was testing withwas burned out in the amp. The other channel works fine.So now I need a new amplifier chip. My local Radio Shack no longercarries components! The chip is a 12 pin SIP (?) labelled with BA5406and then "502 515" below that.Does anyone have a source?

 28         Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm asking for help.  I know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to one, unless it can take it; however what about if I've got a 24-60v stepper.  What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved (a small schematic would probably be helpfull).          Also, I've looked into the TIPC2701N by TI, and I was wondering if I should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message) current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as that illustrated in the schematic (which you the replyer would hopefully help me with).                                 ... hmm... different request...

There are two precision levels, one  for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with  an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  Your original signals.

How are the relays connected to what you are driving?> > Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranferthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentaryopening and closing of the path.The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In highimpedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristicimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfersthe audio.In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs areshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristicimpedance.Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is usedto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make beforebreak and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consistsof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp isoff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowerspassing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varyingthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters andyou have a mixer!Lots of luck!-- 73, Tom================================================================================Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he callsthe rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when thekey is down.My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it'sastonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine withthe hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the distributor pickup.  Very poor design.I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willingto help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference iswasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not puttingout in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the differencebetween a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, areusually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operationwhen you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation whenyou inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving detailsand addresses).>Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.

 28  This may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first timeI've ever had a need for this:I've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on thingslike photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logichigh, etc.).Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some thingswith them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signaland everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative(yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing asan active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so howwould I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have allthree signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as Inever seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.Thanks much,-markumlangston@memstvx1.memst.edu

Two things to watch for:   In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some   of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the   phone can be set to pulse dialing.   In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits   are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and   in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.   Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign   phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.   OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course   illegal.As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecomoperators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMFdialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't havebeen retrofitted with "magic fingers" that converts from DTMF to pulsedialing.Thomas--Real life:      Thomas Trnblom           Email:  Thomas.Tornblom@Nexus.Comm.SESnail mail:     Communicator Nexus AB     Phone:  +46 18 171814                Box 857                   Fax:    +46 18 696516                S - 751 08 Uppsala, Sweden

Thus the heats of formation ofPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,>is exothermic, or energy discharging.As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).(More about this later.)What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two thingshappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitatein a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course thishappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  Ifthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but theyare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restorethe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success withthese products for a newer battery.[stuff deleted]>To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on>concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's>Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will>act to move to a more comfortable position.

A logical consequence of the above argument is this:"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to -50 to 'pull' the reaction along."  We all know from experience (at least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this isnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warmthe battery.(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool during storage.)Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!

Thiswould eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteriesat the same ambient temperature.I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but theone over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may havesome validity.Richard Dell

Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all;what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,which becomes charged as the electron beam intially "writes" the trace.With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level "flood"electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphorwhich are next to the "written" areas on the storage screen.  There aresome problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storagetube, and the stored trace tends to "bloom" with time. Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the currentdigital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in aframe-buffer memory anyways.> / Filip "I'll buy a vowel" Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail "fmgst+@pitt.edu"  \\          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Ah, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new readingprogram that's sweeping Eastern Europe: "Hooked on Consonants!" :-)Bob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any othermyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.

However I am afraid thatthey will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing. My question is is the software pwm control reliable?. I understand that port 0 is a latchand so I vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire duty cycle then I set low..? Any improments ?

The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a biggertown, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.And regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that doesjust apply to pulsdialing. Not to touchtone.Btw; Norway is even more interesting. They got both system! So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live./Joakim Gunnarsson - tde9106@abacus.hgs.se

 21This is a followup post to something I've written previously.  Severalpeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated exactly what I am looking for.I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a hostvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and requireabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lotsof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to beinterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to usean 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROMneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytesto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much forthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UARTbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.Rich
 10Where can I buy or build a device that will convert 20 macurrent loop signals to RS232 voltages?  I know some old terminalscame with that option, but none of the ones I own have that.  Anyway,I want to connect a computer to this old industrial computer to usethe computer with communications software as a console instead ofan old DecWriter.  Please e-mail me if you have any info that wouldpoint me in the right direction.
