 12With the kind of team Montreal has now,  they can take thecup easily.  The only problem they have right now is that everyone istrying to steal the show and play alone.  They need some massive teamwork.They are also in a little of a slump because long-time hockeyMontreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it wasrough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21years.  But I know that is no excuse.  But if the Habs manage to get somegood teamwork and get into the spirit,  they should have no problemwinning in May.Dean

Ramsey inherited it from MikeFoligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from LindyRuff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, whoretired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, inreverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'mnot sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroitand Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smithseems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know ifthe captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games heplayed for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,unless you're a franchise player.-- Valerie HammerlBirtday -(n)- An event when friends get hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edutogether, set your dessert on fire, thenacscvjh@ubms.cc.buffalo.edulaugh and sing while you frantically try v085pwwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu  to blow it out.
 1121992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.--------------------------------Playoffs:---------*Stauber disturbed by third-man themeby Rick Sadowski, Daily NewsBarry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in thecrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well withthe rookie goaltender."I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the mostfun time of the year, and I'm not,"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  "Ithink I have worked hard enough for that."Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goaliein their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays6-3 opening victory.But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind RickKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down thestretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backupagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on OlympicSaddledome popcorn."If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...Idropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?"  Stauber wondered.  "Not that I'd behappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in theplayoffs."Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is notconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.While insisting he is the Kings' "goalie of the future," Melrose said Stauberflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the NewYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to Vancouver on Thursday."Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he couldhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it," Melrose said.  "Anelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of agreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you'vegot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everythingis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expectmore from him than he does."Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when theteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signedoff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end."I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose," said Stauber,a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries."What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniateddisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously doexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'ma perfectionist."Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. "But even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's a bit of a jump," he said.  "You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there."Melrose's "goalie of the future" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. "Beforeyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future," he said.------*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC Channel 7 here in LA.

 26The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after beingdown after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steadydefense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power playphilosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics likeFlatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have toomany talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? Iflast night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that olechampionship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps isto pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing thelast period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injurysuffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time forthe playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar gameagainst the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late thirdperiod goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the gamewinner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacityfor years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed justlike the ole days!!!

 15According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonitethe two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing thePenguins.  This is because the Islanders have won the season series againstthe Devils.  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include:1.  season series2.  goals against3.  goals forin this order (correct me if I'm wrong).  Anyone have anything to add?CraigGo Islanders!

Sure the Pens are a better team.  They've got size and the best skill playersin the league.  They've also got the best clutch goaltending.

 12I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (Myroommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanksfor explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had waswhen they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads andmusic. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into theboards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Otherthen that, hats off to ESPN.

 161Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I postedit; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharksmailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copyback.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I willre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.#8LARRY DEPALMASeason:3rdAcquired:'91-92, free agent from MinnesotaGrade:I (C-/D+)No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was atthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but hewasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared onthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most partfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing gooddefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest ofthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally lookedlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down toKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstatedwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared fromthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharksofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.#10JOHAN GARPENLOVSeason: 3rdAcquired:'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th roundpick in '92 entry draft from VancouverGrade:A/A-After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the restof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on theteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing RobGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second inthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as hewas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to himby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despitehis small size (5' 11", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself aroundwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to workon his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, andwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He willbe a major key to the offense next year.#15DAVID BRUCESeason: 5thAcquired:'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draftGrade:I (?)After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) andwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was botheredvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of thelineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult tospeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected bythe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a manshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensiveleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, hisfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.#18MARK PEDERSONSeason:3rdAcquired:'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave SnuggerudGrade:I (B)It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), butafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to theSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited byinjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But whenhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered aphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liabilityon defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see howmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.#20JOHN CARTERSeason: 4thAcquired:'91-92, free agent from BostonGrade:I (B+/B)Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hardwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although hedid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work cando, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, alwayshussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensivezone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impressoffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  Heis very unlikely to be back next season.#28JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTINSeason: 1stAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:I (B+/B)I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creatingopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHLduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in trainingcamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer inexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with theSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be asolid contender for regular duty next season.#41MARK BEAUFAITSeason: 1stAcquired:2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draftGrade:I (?)After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with theSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and theSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his onlyNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shyto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he playedmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan andKansas City.#42JAROSLAV OTEVRELSeason: 1stAcquired:8th round pick in 1991 entry draftGrade:I (?)Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he wasup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generallyvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once hisdefense is acceptable, he should be ready.#44MICHEL PICARDSeason: 1stAcquired:'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon CorriveauGrade:I (B-/C+)The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems tobe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by theSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals forhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensivebrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, althoughhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in theexpansion draft.#45DODY WOODSeason: 1stAcquired:3rd round pick in 1991 entry draftGrade:I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probablyno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, wasnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losingmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs atleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, ifnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11", 181 lbs.) does not give muchpossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.===============================================================================GO CALGARY FLAMES!

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that hiswas a "jingoistic rant", but you also supported the name-changing on thegrounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individualsthey represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an observation...However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea ofchanging the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier forthe 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional namesbased on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a niceand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do notthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number ofpeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally iswhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league toplay in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed tobuilders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (althoughit was the chicken.....)>Exactly true.

 19Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silverdollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates theanniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins areused every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocketchange right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the onlydollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorativecoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort ofthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with nochance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what'sthe current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If noone knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (orwhatever it is).

But that isonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing withinjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would reallyrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say thisfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and Idon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typicallyhuman attitudes.  With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff"take" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikelyto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you aregoing to come back with "winning spirit" and all of that crap but theseplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to makea decent living. Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does hisjob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Championsof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merelyaccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and "hot".  The emphasis on the playoffs, with their "sudden death" appeal has been promotedby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburghloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in theleague over the year.  They proved it.cordially, as always,rm-- Roger Maynard maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca

This would seem to indicate that there's a BIGshake-out about to occur in the next few years, unless player salariescan somehow be brought under control.  Frankly, I don't see how theNHL's current drive for expansion is supportable under its currentoperating conditions.  If revenue sharing AND a salary cap don't comeinto the NHL soon, look out.-Steve

 17Nntp-Posting-Host: staff.dccs.upenn.eduThis comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studiofor ESPN hockey.The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game (even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game going to overtime.  When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al saidhe heard many people say f**K .!#$%.  ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOTbroadcast the OT of the hockey game.  Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.GET OFF ESPN'S BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT!!!There have been to many f****n complainers about this game that it's making mesick.Geoff Filinuk
 85#21PETER AHOLASeason: 2ndAcquired:'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerationsGrade:I (B)It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because thePenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola hadonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San JoseMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games hehas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't beenspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turnout to be ... Peter Ahola.#24DOUG WILSONSeason: 16thAcquired:'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and2nd round pick in '92 entry draftGrade:I (B)I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too highexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting andplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow tocatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may beWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.#29DEAN KOLSTADSeason:2ndAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:I (C-/D+)It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful ofgames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he'squickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period ofthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here withthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkwardwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap inhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.#38PAT MACLEODSeason: 2ndAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:I (?)MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to mymemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant touse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring thathe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks withKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,a "rehab assignment" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, buthe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensiveskills.#41TOM PEDERSONSeason: 1stAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:I (B+)Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimatedby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yourstruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in43 games.  However, his size (5' 9", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon afterhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chanceon surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.#45CLAUDIO SCREMINSeason: 1stAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:I (D+/D)He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughlyumimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be asmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, isquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense ordefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing thatwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that hewas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.===============================================================================GO CALGARY FLAMES!

 23ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverageand I agree with all of you.  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked upover nothing.  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean haveyou ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? Itsucks, I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in theass.  I was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  I go to school in OhioI *know* the Indians suck, so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I wouldshoot myself.Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to showovertime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was goingto happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep eventhe boring Devils game.Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmlybelive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       obligations*, screw you ESPN.Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!GO HAWKS!!!JB

Actually,I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an endto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, theyare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you whyhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lotfo fun to watch in the playoffs.

 18Buffalo fans:Some people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator Al" on ESPN, believe that game 3 is critical for the Sabres.  HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at Buffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is critical for Boston, not Buffalo.Rob Andolinarandolin@polisci.umn.edu

They should be the superior team.The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting hisstick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction Ihave seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's anasshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call.

How many timeshave they done that in their history?1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straightIn other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being 1) a sweep of Philly in 19842) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME they managed to get out of the division.Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Capsare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in thelast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.Series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd period, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.Blew it and the series.4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.Blew it again.When they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: "if they blew thislead, the series is OVER". They have lost all the momemtum.

We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!Well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Capswere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking "waituntil Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire". Well, they retired (even thoughTrottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet anothergeneration of Islanders were still doing the same thing.

Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoringa ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoringahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factorin the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season inhis career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify asa disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggestdisappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfectcoach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHOhas cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Anycoach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is abright idea needs to go back to coaching school.pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner

The real builders of the>game are Richard, Morenz, Howe, Conacher, Orr, etc.  If you are going to>name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people>who deserve it.I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becomingfront office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, althoughthey were not great players themselves.  I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some peoplehave trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems likea reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by beinguncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realizewhat a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them somethingabotu the history of the game.   >The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.  All of the aforemen->tioned used the game of hockey to make money.  Can you imagine a Pocklington>division?  A Ballard division?  Or how about a Green division?No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to saythat these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people areassholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classyindividual (from what I have heard). Also, isn't the point of "professional" hockey to make moneyfor all those involved, which would include the players.  What I thinkyou might be saying is that the players have not made as much money asshould have been their due, and it is the players that are what makethe game great not the people who put them on the ice, so namingdivision after management people rather than players is adding insult(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than wasdeserved).   _______________________Evan Pritchard --------  Number 1 or 9 depending on the hockey pool =======================epritcha@psych.uiuc.edu

And here's another what-if twist: Chicagowould have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in thefirst place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys inChicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenanall look like geniuses.A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs.

 16Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the wentto the baseball game.  I too was pissed.  How could they interupt suchan important game.  I understand about contracts, but you would think theywould have a clause in the contract concerning important games!Anyway,  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyonein the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live inthe central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?)Telethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not getto see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game, had it beentelevised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the areasince 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.  We are not onlybeing deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, butwe are also being deprived of watching them on TV. PEACE, HAMMER

Jagr did not have a better season than     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice     time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up thefact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure youthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyonewould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-wayplay.In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being askedto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that hecan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top centeris a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On theother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazyfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- likeovertime of playoff games).--Roland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu

I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has "sucked" revenueout of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oilerteam will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship.As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expectsto be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and ordraft picks.-- cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                            "So many morons...rm                                                 ...and so little time."

 26Message-ID: <0fq1Vru00WBNA3L3pI@andrew.cmu.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: andrew.cmu.eduDuring the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have beenimpressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr,MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, oneelement of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changingadantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool andkeep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pensbottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able toconfigure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out newlooks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on anindividual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speedof Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  Asa result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr playedalmost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachernscored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations iscommendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team mightsimply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring aboutsuccess.While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,Bowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearlyseen, mark in  Pittsburgh.

Remember these:- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players movedto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league(2 years ago?)I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be the best way to do it?

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If theywere used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensiveabilities. When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead ofhim.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type ofplayer.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types ofplayers- this includes defensive forwards.When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatestdefensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited beinga defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste hisoffensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a betterdefensive forward, but he wasn't.Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.Gregmeister

The whole organization (read:EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much ofa dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis allseason, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly humiliating him, stripping him of the "C", and then trading him that Springto the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series ofdecimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awarenessfrom the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when itacquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped theroster but he DID lay a foundation.]-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)-steveg@cadkey.com

But I'll neverforget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home inthe pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-netgoal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell thestory for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!"  It sounds stupid, but thatearly (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since thenI've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddenedby Dan Kelly's passing.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and thatwould *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just becausehis gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... >Blaming Stewart is just an>excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst>goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal.

I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.

But I don't>think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear >the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeauwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gaveup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.>Roy is paid big money to >play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money becausethat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of himfor most of the season.>Demers should start Racicot in the next game.

Who would be taught a lesson by this ?The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.>I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't>think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)>in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in>regardless.If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should neverhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of workby Young.

Therefore, Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 4-3,and there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Bostonand Quebec, which means Boston has probably already won.pete clark - rsh FLYERS contact

Then I waited for the scores   to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and    football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid   basketball.

 22I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I canhere in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get areading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly,THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city inTexas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, orwere the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoeverowned the arena doing some price gouging?As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, Ican't help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they trulydidn't support the team.

 24I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alrightspectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience.What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tiegame, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep thepuck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face thatkind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming thatis for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston(except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad,  As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get thepuck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.

There wasn't exactly a radicalshift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). Theonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have ifhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has beenquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with theDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonderwhether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had thoseinjuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because anearthquake collapsed the root cellar.>Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal>contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have>been different.

I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game, but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :) As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season, and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course. I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this season.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom  played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge to Sweden in creating more opportunities. Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada. The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out. Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1. Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal. At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it. That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in  the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal. Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods. The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room. A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best goalie in the world, were some comments after the game. Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well, Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals. The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin- Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well. Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake on the 1-3 goal.

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out thecrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet theystill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling thegame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, theNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they aretrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, beingbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totalsthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants toattract, that these players are indeed superstars.>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is >>true.

Any other The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlachera, when Darryl Sittler was called a "cancer on the team", he tore theC off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Phillycaptaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead,Sittler got traded to Detroit.Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day andthey took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kissthe  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from BradMarsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  triedto give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, lateof the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguablyone of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  ofplaying coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as acaptain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst theplayers.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  makingsure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.-- cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                            "So many morons...rm                                                   ...and so little time."

Itwent: "It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check," he said, "and will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition."Classic, vintage Gallivan!  He's sorely missed.

I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.  I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and  then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own "money" pool  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew  btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and  maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of  curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my  amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to  finsh 79th!

Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player thanGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside fromthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough timearguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But whilehe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloudyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the bestall-round players in the NHL.dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

When he bought the team, it seemed kind ofobvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,before the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impressionthat he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the teamneeded to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticketprices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upwardtrend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that indeciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudelydemanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at theother two arenas in town, etc.Oh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate hugereturns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feelMinnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies downthere as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL teamfor a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL.KEA

The puck clearly hit the crossbarand then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,kept harping about how they "must have had a different view upstairs"because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone whosaw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay "judges" initiated contact withthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, isunheard of.

 118News:=====For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only playerremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not a major part of the team. Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular seasongame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and hasalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. Thoughts on Game 1:==================The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series withLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwingbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but thatwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shakyKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flamesconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was TheorenFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming WarrenRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for theloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He gotvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in offChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. Thoughts on Game 2:==================The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of thepotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgarycame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoringfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgarydominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make betteruse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgaryalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave upa shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in thegame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them whenthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when hewas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. CharlieHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube ofCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct forinstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granatodrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconductfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating afight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy andYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

 40Originator: mckee@oschuba.cs.buffalo.eduNntp-Posting-Host: oschuba.cs.buffalo.eduWow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston.Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Bostonlet Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes thingsslightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and anotherBIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is whyGrant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countereda minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after beingtied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, Ithink Boston would have notched their first win of the series.Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, butI certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually,they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston feltthat would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few moreheroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and Ithink Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinginga new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm notgonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strangethings happen in both pro and college hockey.Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseballswing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylevdeflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was atesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it outin the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  TheSabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger inthe opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called insuch ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabreswon a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took hisshot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few stepsover to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without settingit up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,"They score, THEY SCORE!!!".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumpingup and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skatingover to Brad May who he jumped on.Doug McKeemckee@cs.buffalo.edu

Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to theiradvantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with theirsuperior powerplay. Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well onhis way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man istruly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, were quite stoppable. Alan
 8I recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had variousplayers that were coming into the NHL. I got this particular card ofa Russian named Viktor Kozlov. It says "many scouts believe he willbe the #1 pick in 1993". Another guy is quoted as saying "He's as good as Mario Lemieux". Anyone know who this guy is?????-- Via DLG Pro v0.995

(Why?Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:NHL average:55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIMThen I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players whohad the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.Marty McInnis (NYI)56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)Igor Kravchuk (EDM)55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far offin PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:Bobby Carpenter (WAS)65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)What an honor.I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk andCarpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from behind to take the title:NHL average:53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIMIgor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%)Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%)Rob DiMaio (TB)54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.-SG    And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming...
 13Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke?I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt thanBuffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not thatBuffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).Ah, well, maybe the Devils will pull it out, or maybe the Pens will lose inthe second round, but if not, I hope the Bruins are there to meet them.

I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete withWASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6.BOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the lasttwo weeks.  The only question is how long will it last?Fuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4.QUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7.It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry.The Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5.  CHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. STL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4.DET  vs TOR:  DET in 6.I am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafsoffense is shutting down in the last week.  Can theyturn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the lastcouple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled.I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is,DET in 5.  If not, DET in 6.VAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6.Upset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.There is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure.WIN in 6.CAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5.Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL doesnot watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.CAL in 4.2nd round: ----------PITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Theirsaving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a littletoo high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that,I will say PITT in 6.BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with theB's.  B's in 6.CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machineof late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they playedlike killers.  DET in 6.WIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5.CAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will outmuscle WIN.  CAL in 5.3rd round: ----------PITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take overand give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There maybe something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7.CHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. Finals:------PITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. NO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to sayhere.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will gowith goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7.-jake.

Just wanted to glow alittle.I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in personis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probablybe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dadstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have tolearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously tookthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrivedin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn'tand wouldn't play a lick of defense.It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that broughtall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he hascertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking atthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-uppermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and itwouldn't matter.If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they wouldbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to putFrancis first but I do think the only thing that could really damagethe Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)Mom.

It was speculated at the time, thatthe injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other endof the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as theambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if hewere playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on standby.If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much bloodthere was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clintgrabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in theNHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated thathe just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and Ithink he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so afterthat, and then I believe he retired.Anyone else?-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Carol Boudreau            #44                         a.k.a.

I admit Kocur may get thefans into the game but surely they would rather see Broten taking a pass fromKovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the Rangers up 3 (magic #) goals inthe third period, rather than seeing Kocur take another stupid penalty and theRangers giving up another powerplay goal! The Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure offMessier and the first line.  Nemchinov is a perfect third line center.So who goes Beezer or Richter?Kurt

I can see the relationship between freethrows awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it'sobviously easier to score in basketball, there are moreopportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that'sat least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots takenby each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) isprobably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the otherpenalties, but I think that a player should be awarded apenalty shot only when they had a chance to score and wasinterfered with.Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBAgame you attended was, that play was stopped too often.Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during ahockey game?Matt att UVA

As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they werecalling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings.Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team thencalling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot awayfrom what could have been a great game.--
 7How do you beat the Penguins?Crash the team plane.Ryan
 27While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it mustbe realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled.  As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons togive them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puckhit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shotfor Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someonewho didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to seeBryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Josephwon't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.____________________________________________________________________________|The World Reknown Jason Boskey           | Mail: Bosk@uiuc.edu            ||Known throughout the World as The Bosk   |"Christ, you know it ain't easy,||All Rights Reserved, All Lefts Enhanced  |You know how hard it can be,    ||-----------------------------------------|The way things are goin'        ||"Here they come spinning out of the turn"|They're gonna crucify me"       |----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things aregood in general:  1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and "Basten" are down 3 zip.     (even though there is a possibility either can still win their      series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the      underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).  2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good     enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some     (really) good draft picks... :-(  3. Is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year     the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES?  4.

 92I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sendingit.#2ROB ZETTLERSeason:4thAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:C/C-Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this stillwasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He workshard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone tocostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically anoffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressedto make the team next year.#3DAVID WILLIAMSSeason: 2ndAcquired:'91-92, free agent from New JerseyGrade:C/C-IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) andgood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, hewas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate theplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen lastyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.#4JAYSON MORESeason: 2ndAcquired:'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draftGrade:B+After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training campbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was notparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's mostreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to playsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as thedefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.#5NEIL WILKINSONSeason: 4thAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:B-Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowedeven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and ifhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.#6SANDIS OZOLINSHSeason: 1stAcquired:'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draftGrade:I (A)At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injuryin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had fromtheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, hewas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was stillsusceptible to so-called "rookie mistakes," but was probably the defenseman whomade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come backfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.#19DOUG ZMOLEKSeason: 1stAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:BZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharksto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, butafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on theteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing toughphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But tobecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively anddefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.===============================================================================GO CALGARY FLAMES!

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I haveno reason to doubt it either.Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leaugehockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build theBradley Center.Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was toohigh.Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but ifit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admiralsaren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL cluband a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA'sMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.Charlie BetzCray Research, Inc.

What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, mostnotably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years withPhilly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oatesfor Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantlyto the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered backproblems from which he never really recovered).Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.--Randy

The Ranger announcement is supposed to happen tomorrow supposedly.The Rangers have so many veterans that they had to get a coachwith "weight" and a proven record...and whom they know Messier respects.Gerald

 7According to THE FAN here in T.O., Ottawa has won the Daigle esweepstakes.  They didn't mention why, but San Jose had more goalsthan the Sen-sens, so I have a hunch this is why Ottawa would pickfirst.....Susan

 20Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins?I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of theseries.  If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over.  It will be hello next year.The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr cankeep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by the Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.Finally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.Sabres/Bills Fan

Gilmour is a good two way player.What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should havedrafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux?  Perhaps once upon a time Don Cherry had some insight into the game ofhockey, but he's really degenerated into a parody of himself.Sherri Nicholssnichols@adobe.com

OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.>  What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised.  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the  game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first  round.   Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other  game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some   exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract  then they better put some brains in ESPN people.  *********************************************************************************   ___  ____  ____  ____  ____  **                                         ****  /    /   / /___/ /___/ /___/  **   Experience is what makes a person     **** /___ /___/ /___/ / \\_  /   /   **   make new mistakes instead of old      ****                                **   one.                                  **** E-mail: cobra@chopin.udel.edu  **                                         ****                                **                                         *********************************************************************************

 23Message-ID: <0foVj7i00WB4MIUmht@andrew.cmu.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: po4.andrew.cmu.eduWell, it's not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at thelocal ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playingDavid Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don'teven understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people wouldnot watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? Andif they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to playDavid Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programmingbefore noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on theirmachine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why theypremepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he seemed a bitconfused. When I explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's uptoto our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel, I understand that thesports dept is not responsible for this preemption. BUt I can't understandhow someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffsshown on the very same station he works for.Anyway, I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.I urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB 2 and ask them not to do thesame thing for the next 4 weeks.-Pravin Ratnam(Oh by the way, Pens rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
 36Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinkingwishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions getpromoted and the worst get demoted).Would European fans put up with our "if you've paid, you can play" attitude??How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a goodproduct because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa'srecord every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybeteams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (likeHalifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive withinits own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventuallyget rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and theleague would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influxof newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I candream, can't I??)Look at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fanproblems).Just someone who thinks our system really sucksBarfly(feel free to flame me, my account ends today...hahahaha)1940!!

I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claimthat Gainey never made an error.  And he made the claim.

 11Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the leaguewith the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I can't get the BLUES gameswhere I go to school, thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teamsplay except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse ofthe Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates.His moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud.P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)? Peace,Hammer
 12Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norwayin world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France).The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third periodJuha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoffbehind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his firstpoint of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and hewas awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he isquite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. I think that we will hear from this guy in the future.
 20Sender: usenet@news.ucs.mun.ca (NNTP server account)Organization: Memorial University. St.John's Nfld, CanadaDate: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 00:05:52 GMTTSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported thatMontreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindrosto Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal. If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawagets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary? Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.  They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw inPhillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the franchise. Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montrealfor the pick. Stephen LeggeSLEGGE@kean.ucs.munc.ca

 8For those Leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated forreturn on Thursday's Winnipeg-Toronto game :    Peter Zezel, John Cullen  Mark Osborne and Dave Ellett are questionable to return on Thursday.All regular players who were injured (including Dimitri Mironov) should be backfor Saturday's home game against the Flyers.

 9In Detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. Inthe era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  To win the Cup,a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8playoff wins to win the Cup.  The octopus (8 legs) has become a commonDetroit symbol.  Every year around playoff time people start sneakingoctopus (octopi?) into the Joe Louis Arena and throwing them onto the ice.                                J.

Ithink the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did, they'replaying too tight!!  Who's responsibility is it to check Mogilny?  He hasgotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many reboundswhich are not being cleared by the B's defense.  It's too bad the B's might notget the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again.  I would really enjoy seeingUlfie get beat up by Neely.  We all hate Ulfie, but would love him on areteam!!
 14Have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewedin between periods on a tv game. That they usually get a goal oran assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk to stars more than regular players which explains the hight percentage of results after.Just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont care about this trivial nonsense.ttyl  Tom-- Tom MoffatVictoria B.C.Canada

You actually get 1 more free game than last year, and there will be nomore "radio-only" games.Its a good deal.  Last year, everybody bitched about Baldwin "breakingup the team".  Now, he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of thisteam together and that takes money.

Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands athis neck, blood on the ice.>>Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after>suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  He's been playing in San Diego>for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.He'd been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just wasn'tdiagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided tohave some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just beenput on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted aslong as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line betweenreality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they'vechecked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his handsover and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oventen times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie aboutsomething and automatically assume the situation is the same for hisown life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCDepisode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He feltit slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, heis alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with theGulls (IHL).  >>Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.And Tuttle is no longer with the Blues, but I don't know where he is.Possibly in the IHL, but you'd best ask a Blues fan.-- Valerie Hammerl        John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside,V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.

 31Message-ID: <1r0ura$k56@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.eduHello Hockey fans.Bonjour tout le monde!Well, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided notto televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!Anyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I cannot find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showingeverything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, nowthat ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able topull inthree games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I amnot sure.IF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have totelent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.Thanks in advanceMerci d'avanceP.S.  Anglais ou francais d'accord.Roland Behuninbehunin@oodis01.af.milbehunin@oodis01.hill.af.mil-- Roland

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captainthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos andMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category thanMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player onthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guessI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last seasonas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all comingfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: AndrewCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, andPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed therole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yakebounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will putup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, startedperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to theright side.Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen startedthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commandedthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked hisway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years leftto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subparafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes ofcompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much betterhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who onlyseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he gotto make a number of starts in a row.-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)-steveg@cadkey.com

 9Hi all,I don't get the sport's channel and I'm desparate for some playoff action(especially the Cannucks).  Does anyone know of a sports bar on the BayPeninsula that will be showing hockey games.  I'm looking for something between redwood City and Mountain View.Thanks a lot,Greg
 14Ok guys, I need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during thelast 25 games.  Doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  I'mabout to enter a playoff pool and I want to know who is hot going intothe playoffs.  Don't need to mention Pittsburgh.  They can't get any hotterthan they are now.P.S. I need this by SundayYvon Lavoie

You can't fight,so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot whenthe ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Playersstuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shotsare at a disadvantage in the new system.Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effectivemethod... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance ofcausing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don'tlike it, but that's the way the league is going.By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devilgame. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been alegal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to dothings like that.)

 19Farewell, Minnesota fans.  Get stuffed, Dallas Stars.As the North Stars fade to black, I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul arenot long without an NHL team.  It just seems "right" that the hotbed ofamateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss ofthe team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple LeafGardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.  (I got itto spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up.)  What aglorious season that was for the North Stars!     dwarf--W.

While they had been considered a possible contender when JacquesDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in theNorris).It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--tougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division.Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate StanleyCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a forcein the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, whileover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve justto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *alot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really goodplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (Andno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). Therest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reasonthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to thecoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effortpossible out of his team.

And one playercannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyonereading this will agree.

 36"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks inconsecutive playoff games. If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the icein the last seconds of the game.

 23Hey man! -Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played acouple of sessions of mock hockey, I'm ready to invest in hockeyequipment (particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockeylessons').  However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when itcomes to hockey equipment.  I've checked out local stores and lookedat catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions beforeactually plunking down any money.  Having played football in highschool and college I at least have that equipment as a basis forcomparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages todifferent kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there anynotoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestionsor comments would be greatly appreciated.Tom Menner              I    When you're swimming in the creekSoftware Engineering Institute  I    And an eel bites your cheek,Carnegie Mellon University     I    That's a moray!Pittsburgh, PA          I        - Fabulous Furry Freak Bros.
 7OK, I'm sure that this has been asked 100's of times before, but Ihave wondered since I heard it...  Where the hell did the nicknameof the "Habs" come from for the Montreal Canadiens?Thanks in advance,Caine Schneider

I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have any brain. After the Sundays and last night games, they are still going to  show Devils/Pens on THU and SUN. WHat the hell are they thinking about? I  think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract. I'd rather see Caps/Isls game which is more exciting.

Most people I know say that winning the second Cupwas better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calmto which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans whojust don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  Atlast Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that agoaltender can get anassist.Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happenat any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough tothink for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them outof this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.Spoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living throughthat amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing forgranted.  God, look at Chicago...And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonnalast forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  Mom.

Smithcame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in theback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw whathappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr neverhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezanof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookieat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Startingin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the goaltender, or whatever.And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can onlysay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied latein the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the teamhas to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.Alan

I mean, it was theFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculouspenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got amatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing andseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game"for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germanswere starting to come up strong.I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often notable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have toadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in mostother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present theOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnishspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to seeall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the bestteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite teamlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have toadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite teamto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level asthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that allultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is agreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experiencemost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this asa big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't wejust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawerscorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; allAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hangingaround beeing drunk on ferries...). In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that youdon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.Thomas"There's no time to hate, barely time to wait" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter)

 41X-Disclaimer: Not a spokesperson for Wavefront Technologies, Inc.Okay... here's some gripe"ing" (?griping?... whatever).(I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think)Okay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN.ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the  Red Wings/Toronto game... cool.But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that  ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday.I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but  ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would  show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better  than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the  Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show  video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was  so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])  got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just don't get it.The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want  to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday  and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game  3.  At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game.If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on  Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, I'd be mad as  hell.Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR  SOMETHING.Matt CoohillP.S.  The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I haveever heard (as far emotion goes).  They had the enthusiasm of"Droopy Dog".  I hope for better on Thursday.

I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3.  In fact, the only     point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when     they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate     the Blues.  They scored and took the lead.  Too bad it was     Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties.  When the     Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control.--      Ian Neath        | There are four kinds of people in this world:neath@psych.purdue.edu | cretins, fools, morons and lunatics - U.

 114Nntp-Posting-Host: craft.clarkson.eduX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that haveaffected the AHL this year.ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMSThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued byproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced theleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half ofthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played "home" games in placeslike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff "home"games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. Onedemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus androcked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafswill return to St John's once the strike ends.===================================================SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only CanadianNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clearthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian AtlanticProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintainingthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.==================================================DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city.The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years ifthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold1400 for this year.============================================================SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIALThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city ofSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansionfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.=========================================================CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINEDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the BaltimoreSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announceda limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so playersincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.======================================================AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, producedby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the CanadianMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games ofthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, therehas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered andshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, AtlanticSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am notsure if playoff games will be covered.=====================================================UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around nextseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwesterncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.=====================================================WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEARONE OPTIONANOTHER OPTIONNorthern DivisionSouthern DivisionADIRONDACK RED WINGSADIRONDACKSPRINGFIELD INDIANSSPRINGFIELDPROVIDENCE BRUINSPROVIDENCECD ISLANDERSCDIPORTLAND PIRATESHERSHEYBINGHAMTONSouthern DivisionROCHESTERHERSHEY BEARSHAMILTONBINGHAMTON RANGERSUTICAROCHESTER AMERICANSHAMILTON CANUCKSAtlantic DivisionUTICA (?)

 6If I were Pat Burns I'd throw in the towel. The wings dominated everyaspect of the game.  Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end.  Murrayhas too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5.MarkLet's Go Wings!!!
 6Tonight will see the Toronto Maple Leafs, as some have guessed, come out hitting!  The "Buds" will grind Detroit into the ground and walk away with home ice advantage for the remainder of the series... which given a shift to Toronto, will not last long.  (Keep in mind this is only a predicition).  Wendall will have to get into the game however otherwise Probert will dominate on the physical front.

 49I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice onanother system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses where the administration or the athletics department wants to eliminate the women's ice hockey team. Women Athletes, TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling: Brown UniversityOrdered to Restore Two Women's Varsity TeamsTo: National Desk, Sports Writer Contact: Lynette Labinger, 401-421-9794, home 401-274-7507, or          Ray Marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of Trial Lawyers For          Public Justice   WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appealsfor the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Courtorder requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women'sgymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling inCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decisionin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  TrialLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interestlaw firm representing the women athletes.   "This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if aschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share ofopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,"said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violatingTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law thatprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutionsreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams asuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue tocompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds foruniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had alsobeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.   "This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,"said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &Labinger.  "Universities across America need to reevaluate theirprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced."   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado StateUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and ColgateUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court ordersrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsityteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ isrepresenting women athletes at IUP.   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  TheNational Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and NationalAssociation for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief insupport of TLPJ's appeal. -30-

Even more specifically, I think what Roger was saying (and I saidit previously too) is that these are NOT the people who made theleague great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named afterthem instead of Morenz, Vezina, Howe, Orr etc., the people who DIDmake it great.  Instead, the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men whogot rich off of the men who made the game great.  -- Chris Roney  (e-mail chris_roney@sfu.ca)

ESPN hadprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and hadcontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV dealwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do thisone-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before theseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL bysqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesotagame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseballtelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off lastnight).But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  Theymust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have somethingto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach ofcontract with baseball.So relax.  I'm happy.

Seriously, what is he all about?  Iknow he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him,SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my questionis, what is the deal with him?  Secondly, are the comments of his that Iread about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take himseriously?  I gotta tell you, from what I see, he really sounds like anass.  Let me know - maybe I'm missing something.

After a > couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the > Nordic  (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting > local talent, as prooposed).That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to ourset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained aboutas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, SeanBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs inthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembledfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing.---But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end upwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire andno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:(28-30=superstar)(23-27=star)(18-22=NHL regular+)(13-17=NHL regular)( 8-12=role player)FINLAND:  D-Jyrki Lumme.......20D-Teppo Numminen....20D-Peter Ahola.......13C-Jari Kurri........25C-Christian Ruuttu..16R-Teemu Selanne.....27L-Esa Tikkanen......20(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)SWEDEN:D-Ulf Samuelsson....21D-Fredrik Olausson..20D-Niklas Lidstrom...18D-Calle Johansson...18D-Kjell Samuelsson..17D-Tommy Sjodin......13D-Tommy Albelin......7C-Mats Sundin.......26C-Thomas Steen......18R-Thomas Sandstrom..22R-Ulf Dahlen........18R-Michael Nylander..13L-Per-Erik Eklund...18L-Johan Garpenlov...16L-Mikael Andersson..15L-Jan Erixon........14This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg'sSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York'sTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. ButI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team didwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts ofMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There'spresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars atthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would bethat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.---Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 topplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely onSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as highas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the "dynasty" talkisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have anadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumablyplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn theNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton's "dynasty" crumbled in the late '80s. Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players.

I am a Leaf supporter andI say the Leafs are going down in four unless thereis nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hitsPat Burns.If you were Pat Burns what would you do?Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverageto pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate commentson the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basicidea...Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs successwill have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can haveany presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where thehell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoplesskin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.He used to be good at it.  We need him now.  Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.These guys are the "swing" players for the Wings.  Last year theydid a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quickexit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmourshould be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do anasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  Score Gilmour score!Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play theirchecking line against these "finesse" players - well thenlet them play.** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, andout-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltendingor officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.-jake.GO LEAFS !!!

 80Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993.It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, butit was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I thinkit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)Topics------Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.Episode Summary---------------Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... Thiswas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of thecharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix theCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafsgame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "Theywon in their building, we're going to win in ours".Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmourhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since hegot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims thathe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsiblefor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmourfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchukresulting in a goal.On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties inthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handedhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tellsthe Leaf players "Don't let them score on you".Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montrealwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winnerdisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Donthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use ofinstant replay.On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winningthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for hisplay.Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performanceduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by sayingthat he can't play the way he should, because of the league'snew rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now itsall hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for theproblems.Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by WingsGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murraywas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the eliminationof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper articlein which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don't fightbecause they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicingeach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee therewouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game."Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" withfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there usedto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,someone gets cut every period.Rating------Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supportedby Murray.I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

 15NNTP-Posting-Host: aludra.usc.eduI can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasantsurprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, buthe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish hewere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade awaythat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggestdisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he'sonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, thoughnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, theaward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily beMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of theleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewergoals than Hartford.

They will, but it will be aclose series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.

Detroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6.The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae ismore experienced than Potvin.Final - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.Belfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.Conference Final - Hawks in 6.  It hurts, but the Hawks are more experienced,and that will carry them through to the final.Prince of Wales Conference--------------------------Adams Division--------------Boston vs. Buffalo - Bruins in 6.B's can check, Juneau is darn good, and Neely.

In general, youshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some painand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure anotherplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. Thattwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot ofrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. Hedid not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from theslot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, heslashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As aLeaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), Iwas very disappointed.You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at leastin his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times andfor that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that'swhy their names always comes up as examples when we talk aboutthese issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'dhate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't likehim very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (butintentional) use of the stick.Gary

 14   You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak.  That Pens streakis a PLAYOFF streak (tied by the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won 11 in a rowuntil they met the Pens in the finals last year)  The 18 game unbeaten, so far,is a regular season unbeaten streak.  But hey, don't take it personally.  I'm aFlyers fan and two in a row is a stretch.  But with a healthy Lindros, Recchi,Brind'amour and Tommy Soderstrom, they'll be there next year!By the way, since the Flyers need defenseman, what kind of trade wouldanybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is thatTerry Carkner won't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebookpaper would be better defense.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Matt Weaver (properly found at AJS147@psuvm.psu.edu).  Hey, at least we're not                                                       the Whalers!

They needed the saves Bluecame up with, perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around.   Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is goingto be Blue.

While I stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend wentto the door and rang the bell.  Ron answered and my friend introducedhimself.  He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party.

 17It's about time the boys got it together!!They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games.But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in fullgear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretchin the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don'tflame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepystretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to aminimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked likehe had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why hewas so flat in games 1 and 2.If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance, but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).Barfly
 48    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games    that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would    have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin    with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!    However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the    ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break    whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the    deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the    N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to    watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must    let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody    out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,    on the resulting PP and    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the    outcome of a game.    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down thelevel of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplacetheir balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they gotany.    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.    Steve

 32I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year, all Isleswins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles.Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit abull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was thereand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he'sgotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up gettingstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He eithermakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can'tstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the firstround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so theyshould play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goalgame as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a leadthey could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensiveshell and letting the opposition get back in the game.

It was quite a game.Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run awaywith it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who wonthe game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scoredthree unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted byPaul Kariya.The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow alsoproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSUgoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves byboth.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about onemonth.

Finally, we'llbe able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers.

Has anyone done better?The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wingsdid OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutchand grab style.  They didn't have much talent.Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm notready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after thedraft (which has never made sense to me).

The real hockeyseason is starting!!!!!Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND thenumber of games you think each series will go.  Each round will beweighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but theearly rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 pointsPick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 pointsPick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 pointsPick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 pointsPick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 pointsPick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 pointsPick conference champ, way off on games:  5 pointsPick conference champ, within one game:   6 pointsPick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 pointsPick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 pointsPick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 pointsPick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 pointsPick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 pointsPick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points(these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do sometests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy tomodify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player playsreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Thsis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because heallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps youshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the thirdperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, theywould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particulargoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though theyare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot likeSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there are any legitimate excuses. >Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces >[description of lucky bounces.....]>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that arelatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal. > ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against>an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with>a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penaltyeither...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goalonly, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second goal.>This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,>as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau>were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave>up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, youcould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'whatif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the finalresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again andemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensivescrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalieis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention isfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totallyunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But ifyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the keysaves at the key times.>Roy is paid big money because>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders inthe league.  In fact, I agree that he is.>The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory>comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.                            I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I thinkthe loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I'vemade any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you. --dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of thegame and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest periods I've seen Sweden play this year. Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4 just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole.  Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes, Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away, and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov. Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score. Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman, then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck. The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.  Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes, and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period. Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game, 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player (among those Kariya with 1+6).

(Hard as that may seem)  With the Caps with the #1 powerplay in the playoffs and #1 penalty killing (according to Mike Lange) allthe Caps have to do is make sure it doesn't go OT...as that was Boston's andChicago's demise.

 11Yeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3.Wish I could say I'd seen the whole game but my husband wantedto watch "Young Guns II" on another channel. Sometime betweenthe first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next timeI tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened.Please no woofing from Red Wings fans.  They're my thirdfavourite team, and if they make it past the Leafs I'll wish themluck.  As for Potvin...well, it WAS his fist playoff game.Susan Carroll-ClarkWho likes ANYONE Doug Gilmour plays for

Daigle hasshown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for beingstupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like arock. Also remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumptionhe'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his currentstatus. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lockby any means at this point.It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down hissigning price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thossuspensions.>IMO I would>take Kariya.

Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.>San Jose will then get Kariya.No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's notleaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going touse a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, notwhen there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can makean immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towardsNiedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team canconvince him to leave school early (which I doubt).My cut on things as they stand today:>Draft Order>----------->1) Ottawa (60% Daigle, if not, 40% Pronger)>2) San Jose 80% Niedermayer, unless Ottawa skips Daigle.

 50   Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarterof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros onNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:Canadians: 400Americans: 100Europeans: 100   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sickof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, theRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like "Bure" "Konstantinov" and"Borshevshky". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on otherteams is getting worse as well.     I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about "Pavel Bure, theRussian Rocket" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I seethe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not aCanucks fan to begin with ;-).     Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is thatI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (andsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIRNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't evenbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This "European mystique" is sickening,but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continueto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearlyonly getting worse.    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Buresand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.    I just don't want them on mine.  -- Richard J.

Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactlywhat he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or willsell to someone who will probably get enough.There are a lot of risks in moving a team also......one has to remember "Peter Puck's principle"...it is better tospend other people's money than one's own if at all possible.Gerald
 7Actually, I was angry when they went away from the Pens game.Being a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough.  I onlyget to see them on ESPN, and when they play the Caps, causewe're close enough to DC to get all the Caps games, so whenESPN switched to the Caps, . . . AAAGGGHHH!Matt
 46As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president.After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that BillTorrey is named the first president of the Panthers.A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as persident and general manager of the New York Islanders.Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have becomeas much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves theday-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP andGM.The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL teamto focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 FloridaPanthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida."The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats," Torrey said.  "Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice."More BIO:In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islandersin 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to fourconsecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eightseasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice presidentof the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-offs in 1968, only their second NHL season."I guess this completes my own personal hat trick", said Torrey, 58, anative of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in PalmBeach.Jim G.other accounts:gorycki@sol.cse.fau.edujimg@cybernet.cse.fau.edu--------------------------------------------------------------------"I repeat myself when under stress.

When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they werea pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but lookedunlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending forthe Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM wouldhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelonof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) canmaintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher andQuinn in my estimation.I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seenin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.Gregmeister

 80As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went throughfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I willhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you cankill them.I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective aspossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharksand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...#1BRIAN HAYWARDSeason:11thAcquired:'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:P (D)It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career thatfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passinggrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice thisyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he wouldnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' firstever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.#30JEFF HACKETTSeason: 3rdAcquired:'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draftGrade:CHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simplywasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% savepercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie tobench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carrythe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an earlyinjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return nextyear.#31WADE FLAHERTYSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)Acquired:'91-92, signed as undrafted free agentGrade:I (A-)It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus theincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the CalgaryFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He startedthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVPhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as hetries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for ArtursIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking upall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he canshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, TrevorRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, hemay not ever.#32ARTURS IRBESeason:1stAcquired:'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:B+I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established thathe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He hasprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, gettingthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck andmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, thegoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to dowith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge fora playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being namedas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.===============================================================================GO CALGARY FLAMES!

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  Thereare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down hereit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kidwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say "what does he know? He's fromCalifornia." let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radioplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, werethe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I wason skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreationalhockey for about 35 years.|> >When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city.|> >The insurance alone is a big enough barrier.|> |> The inner city isn't the only place that is poor.|> I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play forthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for clubdues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club duescover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unlessthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the "inner city"areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in anindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin LutherKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just westof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensiveto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy icetime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of themgive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour andinclude the resurfacing time in the fee.-- Alan Hepburn           "A man doesn't know what he knowsNational Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesn't know."Santa Clara, Ca              alan@berlioz.nsc.com                              Thomas Carlyle

 19A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars, or Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of5-3.  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who nettedtwo including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute toplay.Tonight, on the air on the Stars TV telecast, announcer Al Shaver, the voiceof the North Stars, stated basically that he will not follow the team to Dallas.  Shaver, when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him),"What will you do now?" responded, "First I'm going to get me a new pair ofslippers.  Then I'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by."Thank you North Stars, and thank you Al Shaver, for 26 years of Minnesotamemories.Joel Alvstad

I don't like to see stickwork,but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the backof their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton ofbricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupidretaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the shortside.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and withhelpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (whoI have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he playshuge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)Barfly

 19Hooray, I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game, Selannegetting a hat-trick!Of course, here in GOD'S COUNTRY (read Ontario!)

Tonight?

The statsticalodds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Threestraight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguinswinning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn'tinclude weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weakerteam) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has madethe act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning areprobably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't asgood and Boston has a stronger team.

 83Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, althoughI think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)Topics------Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.Episode Summary---------------This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don waspointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from ahotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because ofall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunterand Fuhr.Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", andsaid that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) whenFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised "Don't Trade Fuhr!"Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it wouldbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for thetrade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined bytoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouvergame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domihitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: "Its sad whatthey're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed."Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke "Wendy" for not fighting.However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and howbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: "It's like collegehockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know youwon't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are madeby people who don't know what's going on in hockey".The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed outthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clipof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter wastaught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea ofjust letting kids have fun.At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach'scorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded likeone of the chipmunks.Rating------Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but somegood quotes.I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.------------------------------------------------------------------------------"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit..."          - U. of A.

 11Just heard on the news that Mike Keenan formerly of the Blackhawks, Flyers,and General of a Siberian Prison has just signed to coach the Rangers.  TheRangers, who won the President's Cup last year have slipped just a bit at theend of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers.The Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, becausethey were very interested in him.  Oh well.Go CAPS!!!!!!!Connin--

I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first "modern" coach.Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-roomin the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulatesthe press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important gameslisten to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that towhat is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this wastrademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!I am left asking "What is a modern coach if not Bowman?"-jake.

A couple seconds later, thescreen went completely black, with an error message in large "Bubble"letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO.

The Pens didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like the previous two games. I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and played better or if the Penguins just started to play down somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They did much more swarming around, which at least kept an element of suspense in the game. No question that Billington helped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn't help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the game.

The score should havebeen 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall(bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winninggoal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another)and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT.YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nordsget away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendousgoalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeauwas serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in thelast 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords werecaught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turnedthe other cheek...BASTARD!Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky andon his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't havegone in.Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the loss on Stewart.

However, I'd suggest KellyBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick forthe All-Star game notwithstanding.As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectationsthis year due to his "breakthrough" year (for him) last year, so he didn'treally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of thecallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on thedepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact onthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decentnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-leagueoblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilersdumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) oreven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.-- Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.comHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253During the Roman Era, 28 was considered old...

I think that ifeach series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some oddconsecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUEand keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the twoafternoon games.Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemedto know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey loreand they did an excellent job.

 127By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch StaffAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute tothe playoff-bound Blues.The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and thefinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quitplaying.They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appearedwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleepand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiatingsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that theshot had gone into the net after time had expired.``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end," Blues coach Bob Berry said.If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and makingthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.``It wasn't pretty at the end," he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, asgood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, butit did."Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil thisseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawksin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday atChicago Stadium.The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three pointsbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended itsfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyousBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.``It's a shame we let down," said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to scoretwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would haveended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.``We won, and that's all that matters," said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."Some players didn't have a problem.``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit," said RichSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. Youcan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.``It was disappointing to see what was going on."Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.``I didn't know it was final," he said. ``I was kind of looking around on thebench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at theend."The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboardoperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The scoreshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the thirdperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,"Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took."If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win mightbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowdgoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, dekeddefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with therebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonskiafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game ofthe season and reminded him of a special friend.Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare formof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver," Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, andI know he was watching. I know he's happy."Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zomboat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 secondslater, making it 5-1.Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Berglandscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a passfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the thirdperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goalsto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the thirdperiod.The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as thewinner. ``We were in there," Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %   %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *   *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %   %     \\    ________/                                                   *  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %   %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               %   %        (___)             BLUES                                       *   *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, andthat he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. Butthe market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in thelast three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.Pettit gambled and lost. Now he'll have to pay more.-SG

Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to selland will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).Others can add on their opinions as well.Kevin L.

 17(Detroit, April 19)In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwingsscored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world enroute to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferiorDetroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating ofAndy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus onthe ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the league's best team.

The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the early round playoff games, will be available by "subscription tv" only.To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, andthen a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radiobroadcast team.  No word on who the announcers will be.

 43   Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000.I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...

I'm sure the future will turn you into believers too.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards !         I hope I'm just out of my mind.        There won't REALLY be a Disney team in Anaheim, will there?        The Stars aren't REALLY moving...

This was the first time I heardThorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leaveAl Micheals out of this. He annoys me. I'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. My guess wouldbe is that it will be roughly a weekly game from Feb.-April and then the playoffs. I envy you Canadians with your TSN & CBC. Maybe I'll get a dishto pick up Canadian TV. How much are those things, BTW?

Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores alot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for thesame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equallygood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to comparebetween players on different teams.I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how usefulare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it isa missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuringthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be abetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality icetime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given lowamounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach whodoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots ofquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach thatthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to seethat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowedis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.Gregmeister
 20You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who playsthe way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artiststhrough the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has beenout right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbedand players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When playerslike Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowedto continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins geta chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as aStanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingersin the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would noteven notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.Rich

 57Nntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff ofnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.     For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first threegames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in abest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work thistime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home iceadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  Itwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as startinggoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, onthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two wasKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabresstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik andHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on ashot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and BobSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split ofpenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski gethis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minuteslater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tiedthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweetrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on atip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.Both teams finished with 34 shots.          Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.        Referee--Rob Shick.Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot ofclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantasticagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and insteadflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel ideato Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've everheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I wasonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and noone took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd wastoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, asmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylevdidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn'tskate out when his name was called.

 12While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the "slash" thatBarrasso took on the neck.  This brought to mind the goaltender who had hisjugular vein cut by a skate.  I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive.Does anyone remember/know his name?  What has happened to him since?  Whatabout the player whose skate cut the goalie?  Name?  Info?  Has this everhappened before in a hockey game?   Thanks,CarolGo Pens!

However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to BaseballTonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cutaway at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) ifESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan tolet SportsChannel pick up the slack.Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regularseason baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.Support your team; support your game.Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chryslerto thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we wouldconsider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watchbaseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spewbags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letterscomplaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure andthat you won't consider buying their products because of it.-- Mike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com  ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh's.

 13(Detroit, April 21)Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit RedWings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to another easy victory over the best team in the NHL. For the best goaltender in the world, Felix Potvin, six was a bad number ashe surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponseto the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team. AlanP.S. We told you this would happen, Roger. Didn't we? I love it.....

The most logicaltrade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sureif Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to hisroots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps theRangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him andthe opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.

It looks like thegoalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment gettingbigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much biggernow than they were some years ago).Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way????Mikko Wihervaara   >Jarkko #14-- T{m{ on nyt t{mm|nen testisigun kai piti olla muutamarivinennyt viel{ pari

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old whois obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the lastquarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plainstinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himselfinto position to make the nifty passes. I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agreesto pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to helpa team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, andMakarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will justbite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With hiscurrent attitude, he is a detriment to the team.Alan

 158Here is a press release from the White House. Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey TeamApril 19; Q&A Following To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcriptof remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine "BlackBears" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                           The Rose Garden 9:58 A.M. EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It'san honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, thewinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to theRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchellthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to wina national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together towin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together tocheer them onto victory.     Coming from a state that is also relatively small insize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I canunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.In our state people are still talking about the time we won theOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that wasback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Mainewill as proud of this team as they are today.     You know, in my state football is a slightly morepopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, Ican understand a little more about hockey than I did before I camehere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It doeshave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wishwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  Inthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the MajorityLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; juniorSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'mactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much youngerthan me.     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has donea great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championshipgame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else Iknow a little bit about.     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teamsand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell andSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Mainemust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as ateam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come frombehind.     I think it's important, as I ask young people fromaround America who have achieved outstanding things in workingtogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized andappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of valuesand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for allof our lives.     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to havethem here today.  (Applause.)     (The President is presented with team jersey.)(Applause.)     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.(Applause.)     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                             * * * * * *     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Wacothis morning, sir?     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the AttorneyGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questionsto her and to the FBI.     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how itshould be executed?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.That was their judgment, the FBI.     Q  Is this a raid?     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to bedone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tacticaldecisions.     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about thismorning?     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay myquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  SenatorMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happenthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going tohave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes totalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, andtalk some more.     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that yourcompromise is no compromise.     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, SenatorDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted forthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our researchindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reaganand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of thosepurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American peopleback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but youcan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this positionthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-yeardeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that timeand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all gotto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base theirposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of thiskind that had very little to with putting the American people back towork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty goodabout it.     THE PRESS:  Thank you                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT -30---Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario416-629-7000/629-7044

Very goodplayers who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) whoprovide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  Thatdoesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadianshad at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey coulddominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate.He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never beenanyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.Gregmeister

 1184/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0-----------------------------------------------------It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph andthe Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People werecheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for theentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morninghours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. LouisPost-Disptach. Enjoy...By Dave LueckingOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Bluesgoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking thethe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More ThanJoseph."  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues tothe verge of a surprising sweep.Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0lead in the best-of-seven series.The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the secondperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in thefirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of onlytwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have hadonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they sweptPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had tomake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and theBlackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blueswere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers andscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in eachperiod. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwiseChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, androokie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final period.Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour ``Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye."Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues areon a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the firstminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahandumped Steve Smith at center ice.Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Josephbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived ascare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away toSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threwat him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Josephabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterflystyle is deadly.Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through theperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only twoshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole thepuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour. Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's thirdpenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttuslashed Shanahan.The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got itwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's rightshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfourdived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it intothe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and theBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two secondsremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues byshooting the puck into the Blues' bench.Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, andMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midwaypoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increasedthe Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stoppedeverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second periodand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirectedFelsner's pass.  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %   %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *   *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %   %     \\    ________/                                                   *  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %   %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               %   %        (___)             BLUES                                       *   *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

WABC did the samething; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30,because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of the reasons for this is left to the reader ...It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local teamcoverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of theBruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've readthat Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spenthis early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landingthis job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to sayabout the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SCChicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair,SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabrehomers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBCcoverage of the Habs-Nords series.

 35Jesus Christ!!!The score is now 6-0. The Pens are beating the shit out of the Devils whogave up in the middle of the 2nd period. ESPN does something smart. Theannouncer states "well folks this game is getting out of hand. Lets go tothe Islander/Capitals game." I celebrate as I was actually making progress inmy CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game.  I tear down andthrow on my jersey, Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the firstcaps game I've been able to watch all season. And what does ESPN do? theygo back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning!     The period ends and the sportscaster (CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP!! YES!!oops excuse me =) goes into his penguin worship mode (Dont freak pens fans!They are worthy of this! I'm so glad we wont have to play them as much nextyear!) and here comes the 3rd period...what? its the blowout again. Oh theywere just waiting for the Cap/Isles to get out of intermission. Goodthey've put a close game back on. Wait! WHATS THIS SHIT?!! THEY'RE SHOWINGTHE BLOWOUT AGAIN!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!(Oh guess what the score is now 7-0 penguins! Switch games you $%&*#@!!!)Holy shit they're changing games! ITS ABOUT GODDAMNED TIME!! Lets see ifthey'll stay.LaterI think this proves by $#%&* point.

I guess the Canadian referee (one of theIsostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that, but it didn't helpmuch.I guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi-Kill-'em-All-Everyone-But-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitudein every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer)It really pisses me off!I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but most of them seem to do...Jokke Kylmaojagolf@phoenix.oulu.fi

He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it becausehe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at whichpoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks andhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for notreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him asinjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shippedhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearlynot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just ano-no).Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he washurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probablyanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest ofhis career.

His future with the Sharks was made clear to meone night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried tohold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto'sneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turnedaround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carterwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbieMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me"you have to make room for the kids". Carter, in fact, refused to report toK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks.

He was oneof the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in1992.  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players inthe WHL.However, I was extremely surprised when he was drafted, especially inthe third round.  He certainly didn't look like NHL material...-- Paul Brownlow|         Visualize Data I/O Corp.  Redmond, WA|   Whirledpaul@data-io.com|    Peas|
 8Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln?  I had him inmy kill file since last year's playoffs and now that I've moved to a newnews reader which doesn't have kill files, I find that he's gone.  I mustadmit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the gameas long as the subject doesn't touch on the Leafs.Ray Skirsky rskirsky@qualcomm.com
