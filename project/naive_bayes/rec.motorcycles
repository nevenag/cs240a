 12I have a problem with the battery on my '83 Honda CB650 NightHawk.Every week or so it is dead and I have to recharge it. I ride the bike every day, the battery is new and the charging system was checked thoroughly and it seems fine. My suspicion is that it is drainingsomewhere. Do you have any idea about what is causing this problem?Please help since my mechanic and me are clueless!...Ljubomir
 30Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quietintersection right in front of me but there was enough distancebetween us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dogsuddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper andthe force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.Apparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dogdecides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog asmany dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I whichhas a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff)but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one ofthe smaller nippers while the larger ones would have troublegetting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'ddef feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easierleg chewing target for those mongrels.If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despitecomplaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to runningover it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHOcompared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to theground by said dog and dies from a head injury. Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menacerunning about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate.Graeme Harrison(gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com) DoD#649

At a tuned engine rpm, thestacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the airrushing in.Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum ofthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way insidelong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air fromescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansionchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how theydesign for shock waves.<================================================>       /        Rich Sturges           (h) 703-536-4443   \\      /    NSWC - Carderock Division   (w) 301-227-1670    \\     /  "I speak for no one else, and listen to the same."  \\    <========================================================>

When an animaldecides to take you, there's nothing you can do about it.  It hassomething to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at amere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped afence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!

No damage to cow, a bent case guard and aseverely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had myshotgun I'd still be eating steak.

When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me,I've found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light bypumping the pedal. You will, obviously need a bit of free play in yourbrake pedal to do this. It seems that even the most brain dead idiot canusually discern that a flashing red light directly in front ofhim/her/it may mean that something is wrong.The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light maychange before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth, or theoccupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate suchphysically (on you or your now-parked bike).

 23I have a '72 CL350 which I stopped riding about 2 years ago (I upgradedto an '84 Sabre 750).  I parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and plannedon draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store.Well, after a lot of procrastination, all I ended up doing was throwing a tarp on it.Well, now I have to move and want to clean up the 350.  I tried starting it(with someone else's battery) and had no luck.  My first guess is that it isthe gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (I can onlypray that I didn't trash the carbeurators).  The question is, what do I dowith this old gas?  I am not going to run it in my Sabre, and I think thatthere is enough that I don't want to burn it (campus police don't thinktoo kindly about bonfires).  Dumping it isn't a great idea.

If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated withsand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.As far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they cantell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-orderit if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessoriesalways seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle AccessoryWarehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some bootsfrom them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW wasabout $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but onMonday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW acompletely unreasonable question: "Do you have them in stock?" Theconversation went something like this:I need to know if you have some boots in stock.Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?I want to know if you have them in stock.Well, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call thedistributer to find out if we have them.So do you have them or not?Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call ourdistributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.Uh, right. So can you do it?Yea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.So an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and callhim back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I calledChaparral and asked if they had them in stock:Ooh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,but I'll check. What size?Size 10.Let's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...I'll take the blacks!This was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Onceagain, three days via UPS ground.

 24Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that I am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my Zephyr too.If I can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out ina couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens.It's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer,plus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactlyone year ago (Apr '92), it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and aluggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   I'll spareany further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it, and (2) somebody5'7" +/- 5" will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people, but not asmall bike.  Standard, upright positioning and good-looking.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,    fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and hollerback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffledMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you can't really communicate.Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know howthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediatelyand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaningthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is apain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stayperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turnand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This alwaysscrews up the line I've picked out.Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be   gradual, so I can compensate.- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right   thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to   watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,   and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, "SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED"   I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with   the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to   trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of littlemudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners willbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the first trip!Good luck -- have fun!--DON'T DRINK SOAP!

It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff thatyou probably don't realise is there, and give your paintwork its originallustre and shine. It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint, though,so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff.

I then went out shopping fora new lock for the bicycle.For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back indisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered bythe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards ofquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cablelock with the Kryptonite name on it.Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  Idon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was oftenquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimesit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which servesthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the lock mechanism would stand up to an "insert screwdriver and TORQUE"attack.Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer theweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patientyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go through the cable in well under a minute.--   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Michael Robinson                          UUCP:   ucbvax!cogsci!robinson                                        INTERNET: robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu

But in regard toAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aerodimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matchingthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am veryconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference inprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. Ithink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of adifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you gosomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)you can just detach and stow the pants. One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit formany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (andpetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish Igot 2-3 inches added to my pant legs.

Probably only hits 25mph, or so. (I made the mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge, now.)I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph from the other direction.I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front tire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral imminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back home, but I haven't seen it since. Sniff. Sometimes Fate sees you and smiles.-Rick

You either have to bea AMA member, or maybe it is just a discount for AMA, not sure.(Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN to become an AMA member)The shipping cost is based on the number of miles.  It cost me about $500for Portland to Orlando.  $80 of that was insurance.  All I had to do isride it to the shipping dock and siphon the gas out.  I think they canalso pick up the bike from any business.  The bike arrived on-time atOrlando.  All I had to do was adjust the mirrors and add gas.  The bikewas in perfect shape!--Gary

But we knowenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike overto begin a turn.1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing atorque which twists the bike over.Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would beneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by eacheffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and athigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far offbugger all, relatively speaking.By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants torun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a runninggroup where we could start "counter-footing" arguments and have themall falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?-- Chris Malcolm    cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh          +44 (0)31 650 3085Department of Artificial Intelligence,    Edinburgh University5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh, EH1 2QL, UK                DoD #205

 25My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchangepedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-downfor few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me whenriding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took thebike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentionedthat it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove thefront sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would findthere. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchangeaxle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, inaddition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove thesprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of theengine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know theexact term in english, sorry) ?Question : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or someother purpose ? Does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ?Thanks !Teppo NieminenDoD #2000Zoo Mc Helsinki Finland
 37NNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.eduI'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about fighting my ticket.Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your case in court.  Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge about the circumstances surrounding your ticket, while one fellow lostbecause the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness.Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called "Fight Your Ticket".The general theme from those who said "go for it", was to be prepared.  I should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge,and to be positive and assertive.  I am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp>A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his dayoff or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness, and if hesays I was speeding, then by damn, I was speeding.Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun.Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all.

(BTW, as of acouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is thatmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easilyby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is aHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these arenot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap iton a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.Mike-- Disclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?exit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!man help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel "Hey, what does Stop L1A d..."
 33I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, thatis, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold onhard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over theinside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leavingDave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and luggage.Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit off the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handlestightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'ma lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for him to manage.On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutelyrefuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That'shelmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibilityto require it if they want to ride.And I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experiencecarrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carriedmany passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration beforeyou head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton. That's a nasty place to find yourself in trouble.------------------------------------------------------------------Godfrey DiGiorgi - ramarren@apple.com  | DoD #0493      AMA#489408 Rule #1: Never sell a Ducati.         | "The street finds its own Rule #2: Always obey Rule #1.         |  uses for things." -WG------ Ducati Cinelli Toyota Krups Nikon Sony Apple Telebit ------

 16Nntp-Posting-Host: sdcc14.ucsd.eduI need help getting my ZX-11 (C3) to behave.  I've managed to getthe front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks.  I can'tdo anything with it to make it feel ok.  The bike is very stablethrough the corners (I think because I have the front just right),but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous.  It feelslike it actually amplifies the bumps.  And the damping doesn't seemto do anything in real-life, although you can tell the differencewhen the bike isn't moving.  I've tried 4-5 cm of sag (fromcompleteley unloaded), but I don't know which way to go.  Has anyonegotten the rear of this bike comfortable?  And if so, what kind ofsettings (esp. what sag) did you use.  I like to corner, but I alsowould like my kidneys to remain intact.  This thing makes the newZX-7 feel comfy....rbarnes@sdcc13.ucsd.edu

 40X-AltNet-ID: 231252  Grr. Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.  Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after work, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the ride was very zen.  Got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work on her computers with, rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got home.  Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said "to heck with it" and drove my cage back up.  Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm yellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes into the trip.  And me in my cage. Oh JOY.   Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the bike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the entire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but annoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing them this afternoon.  'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned "2 D-Cell Flashlight" headlight.  Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? Since the charging system on the CB360T can't handle continuous use of a 50W halogen headlight, I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do, but wouldn't drain the battery during "normal use" (chiefly day trips and commuting to work and back)...

For thebottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I havelarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to getthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at thewaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piecesize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it'sproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, andwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits arein some way different from us real folks.Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damnwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in astore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottomin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in mysidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generallyleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants falldown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll berunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probablyequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 pieceprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable aroundthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.So I'd have to vote for the two piece.

 7Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.

I don't>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:>>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate onhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so Iactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet androde around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided toinvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around thenI also passed my road test.On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into theoncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic wasalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid undera car and been killed.Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took theExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier trainingcould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greatersince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuffas I did.So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  Iwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless youhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace untilyou're ready to use it.>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have >to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too >ignorant to know I need to buy)While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks inDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could yousave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make surethe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-upmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registrationand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 notincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in >about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a >motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes>a difference)I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantialcoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to bepoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergomore expensive.>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcyclemagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new orrecent models might be available.  You could probably look throughpast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My firstbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's adviceinstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or thatare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike bynoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running aroundand they were generally set up the way I wanted.Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visitingshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms andquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hencecheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.

Where did they go?                      You don't think .... naahh.
 47Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycledealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myselfhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experienceof that visit and of an observation of "SQUILDLY" behavior by other customers and/or sales personel:BACKGROUND:I ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into "cruiser" type bikes. Myfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. Hewanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealerthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. The place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few Intruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I moseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.I could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),but I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figuredto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangsfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the "hormone gang"talking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No bigdeal.Here is the part that concerned me. The "HG" and those shop personel that werenot busy with customers went back out, where said "HG" members fired up theirrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.SQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/managernot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were theywere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheelyas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her"pilot" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkerscould be heard as well as felt.I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of thosein cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot anddamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a littleuncomfortable and we left. I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear myanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an openmind and doesn't associate me with them. BTW, I can't afford a new bike.....

Suggestions?The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike ingear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way andstall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance thatI'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra timeneeded to put the bike in gear.So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-secondevasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line.(Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can'tsplit (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of thelane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the nextcar has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sureit will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail tostop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbitof racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard totell if they are planning to brake or not!So in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch yourmirrors until it's all clear.-- Paul Thompson    Apple Computer

Figure.>John Stafford   Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RSthat was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial powerburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I alsohad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all thetime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gearin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of "slip" device in the shaftto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricanedo a "stoppy"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend theseactivities anymore (now that I'm an "old guy" with kids of my own) butit looked damn impressive!!

Sometime duringthe lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the studentwould take him for a ride.

Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximityto highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommendedthat manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step functionprovided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto thegas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturershave taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.Chuck Rogerscar377@torreys.att.comcar377@cbnewsj.att.com

 29NNTP-Posting-Host: foucault.ossi.comA few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having takenpassengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used toride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be duein part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, areparticularly slimline !I always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makestheir movements predictable.My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,making any kind of maneuvering difficult.I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves andshifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (abouta 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me alsositting very still and getting a sore back.We have a code system for turns, stop and for 'I need to shift position'.-- Chris Seabrook, Fujitsu Open Systems Solutions Inc | Phone: +1-510-652-6200x1186121 Hollis Street, Emeryville, CA 94608-2092, USA | Fax:   +1-510-652-5532                                                   | DoD:    #0861             Per saltire gules and Or, a sun counterchanged.

One is a capable andsmooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and greatbrakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city butgreat on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, butI don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is goingto pluck me by the short hairs.  Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  Theydo this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manageto straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Doesanybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact todiscount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikesthere, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebodyguesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucsonthey only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,per annum.Muchas gracias,Enrique

I don't see many people using slip-on's>but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive.>>Thanks!>Dave>Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more performance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of the slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not supposeto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full throttle.Just remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake orexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you mayhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaustsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the pointwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumpingprofile.Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them ifthey have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have thesystem also to see what they think about there slip on.Also, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on agroup of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a side bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp atthe rear wheel, 85 verses 91. Buyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power!

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse D'Elegance and more.  This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the  event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman, "The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's Highway 49."  Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a  pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.  The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89, two miles South of downtown Quincy.  For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195 ADDITIONAL NOTES::    This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa,    Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.    Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the   awards ceremony.     For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on    registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +   needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.

Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggleof the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean tooccur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcyclethan a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (Ok, so mymotorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.)-David

 59I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires thatwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have anowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psiinstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should runat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are forthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an AvonRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are largerthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my firstmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers innertube qualities?The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the currentrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to bevery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on thefront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision andFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drivebehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictableback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as givingmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are verygood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish tomount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to becareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim tocheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday andI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventuallyI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could befork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a framemounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lowerbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good conditionrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactlyaccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it isjust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

 111Nntp-Posting-Host: prague.gain.com Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts! BACKGROUND ---------- The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions  devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad  interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,  roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering, motosports enthusiasts. The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada Finland, Switzerland, and the United States. The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need  to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of  performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise  ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join. Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to  issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be "flame-free".   HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION --------------------------------- You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day (depending on the topic).    NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the       list directly.  After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.  Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily or digest distribution (as per your initial request). HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION ---------------------------------- It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out  whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the frequency of postings this appears to be about every other day. Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every  30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM HOW TO POST TO THE LIST ----------------------- This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out) you can include a "metoo" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX based mail systems).  BOUNCES ------- Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally, sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I administer this list) contact me through my administration hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

 17OK -- so we've got a hotly contested BMWOA election and some inept leadership.My question is the history of the BMW organization that lead to theformation of the BMWRA. Was there something going on in the OA yearsago that precipitated the formation of two competing owner's groups?Just to stave off flames: I'm a (relatively new) member of both groupsand besides a difference in the slickness of the magazines, it seemsthe major difference is that the RA guys seem to have more fun. . .Art-- Art Campbell          artc@world.std.com            72227.1375@compuserve.com   DoD 358                                  _Real_ BMWs have just two wheels.

 29After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I havea couple of questions I hope you can answer:When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fillcap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used tothe dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped cleanand reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bikeis part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  DoI remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/withoutscrewing it down before reading?The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B onthe head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  doyou know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighterreplacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphiahas finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the ridersALL waved.

 44Hello Folks,I'm very happy with my "new" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expectingsomething rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty muchanyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  MaybeI don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opiniona little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are my questions:1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep thewind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block myvision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on thecrash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam comingout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear sothat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternatorsdon't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'mputtering around in the dirt at low RPM?  3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thingin the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a sectionof the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasolinewith alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keepthe engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?Thanks,/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\|                                                                ||     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      || '90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               ||  '86 BMW R80GS                                                 |\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/
 24So it looks like I'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storagefor a few months, starting several months from now, and I'm alreadycontemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again aspossible. I have everything under control, I think, besides thebatteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each oneand leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage,they'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heardanyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn'tso great. But maybe someone can tell me.Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain theelectrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal thecontainer, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then itwould seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put theelectrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fullycharged. What's wrong with this?On a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, wasn'tthere someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who wasit? Is there still any of it left?Thanks for any and all help!-- Robert

Me too, though unfortunately the "Official Line" is the one that youhave to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner'sguidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider educationcourses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of therider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact thatthe riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the timein order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, thatyou have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of justwhen it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can'tthink of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figureswould (imho) reduce still further.Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...:-)

 24Sender: news@watserv2.uwaterloo.caOrganization: University of WaterlooDate: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 16:52:52 GMTHi, I just have a small question about my bike. Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to think about my Honda. She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and was running only on one cylinder. I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for this bike. Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the wear of my pistons??Please send comments to sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.caThanks in advance.

 11  One of those "morning, just getting the coffee in me" thoughts:  Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just "Hey, how's it going, nice to meet you on the road, have a good ride"  1) If you're watching for other bikes to wave to, it means your attention is on the road, where it should be, and you're more likely to see cages.  2) It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when you're IN a cage. This is a Good Thing.

Keep the bike in1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that forengaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along sideof the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it, or youwill pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly, justrapidly.

That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feelingcreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you canmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Notthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'lljust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the wholenet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.By now you're probably asking "So who's the KotL already?". Well, asJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left aroundhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John wasthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, theKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirelywith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen postingmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weeniemailers"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being aDead-Head.***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronicallygroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeedwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by gettingsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times ofeconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yetanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (itjust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as anexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at leastannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former requestwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you thinkthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).***********************************************************************One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't whatthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &e-mail address. For example:0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the onlyrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, asthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com------------------------------------------------------------------------            "Denizens of Doom", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valveseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They argue with each other and plan rides together.The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer.The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for the group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred to as the DoD.The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "Denizen of Doom."  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway and Finland.Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's "Silicon Valley."  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California "Joust."The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to get together.  Long may they flame."Live to Flame -- Flame to Live"[centerbar]This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as "flames";  issuing them is called "flaming."  Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be something like:  "What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad poseur!"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding ability and your cat.------------------------------------------------------------------------          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011Periodically the question "What is DoD?" is raised. This is one ofthose questions in the same class as "Why is the sky blue?", "If thereis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "Why dowomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before theydump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussionby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in thehalls of academe for generations. A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a fewminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) ona computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; twomachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one anothervia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (butwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire ofthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, andsigned it "The Denizen of Doom". Not wishing to identify himself, heasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of timebecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whitabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinkingindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this wasthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is prettyeasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of DoomMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membershipnumber. Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of amotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand ormake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organizedelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become apart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, agestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than thesum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds whowear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happento also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weightratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be openminded enough to accept us as members. In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of DoomMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members havenever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yetfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given someof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organizedand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through thenetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in thesame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulatingaround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 anddistributed on VHS by #18)! Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board enginemanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where eachparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminalroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than netaccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need onlyask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the fewreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email amembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, whichincludes name, state, and email address. The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at leastuntil next year when we may decided to change the name).

TheNames have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version ofyour name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working againstyou. Read 'em and weep. We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. TerribleBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane toReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer     11 but what the heck.  Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a     Woosh-a-stream.Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see     what they say, eh? Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!Terrible: B.T.???Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean      even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange withDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller andthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?Heritick: Nahhh.Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!Muck: What's a carbujector?Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!Dill: Well, where do we race?Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't     ride! Muck: No! No! Quiet!Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!High: My 9 too!Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up morecohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and theinfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting     it up on the ole ventral stand!  Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! Booster: I hate Cavortin.All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.Booster: I love Cavortin.All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.Muck: What about a Tridump?Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.And Now even more west coasters pour in.Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. Itwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. Muck: Why??Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.Clean: No GOOD!Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!Clean: Inferior!Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boysburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me athrill... Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,     WILHEM! Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and thethunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them allboomed out.G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be ridingmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?

Quist   DoD #94[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll callChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had atthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizensreferring to each other as "Chuck". I guess you had to be there. Iwasn't.) Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst, cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir, may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted to live a man's life,[Music slowly builds in background] riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys, living the life of a Motorcyclist; doing donuts and evading the police; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children; eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,I Want to be      A Denizen![Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (withfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top ofan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angelssit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oilon the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed FatBoy.] Chuck [Sings to the tune of "The Lumberjack Song"]:I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,I flame all night and I ride all day.[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:He's a Denizen and he's okay,He flames all night and he rides all day.I ride my bike;I eat my lunch;I go to the lavat'ry.On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,Running children down with glee.[Chorus]:He rides his bike;He eats his lunch;He goes to the lavat'ry.On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,Running children down with glee.[Chorus refrain]:'Cause He's a Denizen...I ride real fast,My name is Chuck,It somehow seems to fit.I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,But like a real good sh*t.Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!I flame all night and I ride all day.[Chorus refrain]:Oh, He's a Denizen...I wear high heelsAnd bright pink shorts, full leathers and a bra.I wish I rode a Harley, just like my dear mama.[Chorus refrain]------------------------------------------------------------------------                    Why you have to be killed.Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managedto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD startedas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "What does DoDstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?" Naturally, aDenizen who had watched the movie "Top Gun" a few times too many roseto the occasion and replied:"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."And the rest is history.A variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation aboutwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, whereknown) include:Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)Doers of DonutsDancers of Despair (DoD 9)Debasers of DaughtersDickweeds of DenverDriveway of DeathDebauchers of DonutsDumpers of DirtbikesNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to belimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.------------------------------------------------------------------------                     The rec.moto.photo archiveFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and ChuckRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish inunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriatefor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has notonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has takenthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawkat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from theserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about howto use the archive.**********************************************************Via ftp:cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]Via e-mail:The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of themessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  Thearguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  Forrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:dir [dod]send [dod]bruce_tanner.gifsend [dod]dodframe.psand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded partsof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up tothe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of50K each; not a good idea.-- Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDUCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner**********************************************************A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, sowhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kindof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). ------------------------------------------------------------------------                      Patches? What patches?You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &pins. And your reaction was probably: "I want!", or "That's sick!", orperhaps "That's sick! I want!"Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is thatthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The badnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn'tbecause of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no"DoD store" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done byindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure issomeone says "I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Thenorders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover thepre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want aDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Orproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after allthis is anarchy in action.Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (andperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), andpatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) bypopular demand].All "profits" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist AssociationMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has beencontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of "Denizensof Doom, USENET, The World", complete with a DoD pin.------------------------------------------------------------------------Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMTI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,the other day."Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and theDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated isnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitudeto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presentlybeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, themuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

Over $5500  [Arnie]                         Organized (?) Rides:Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its thirdyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Passtrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens gottogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far northas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains ofNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first GreatPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse forriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all havecome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in theMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal2-strokes.  And though it's not an "official" (as if anything could beofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle racesin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for nettersto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

 35Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on mySoftail Custom with the title ones. Installation was pretty easy inboth cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me! I discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buyingand making the requisite tools!MC Ignitions Power Arc II Single Fire Ignition: easy to install, butread the wiring diagram carefully!  Setting the static timing was apiece of cake.  Once installed, I have found easier starting, smootheridle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in theexhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-)The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions onthe phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.S&S Super E Carb: installation easy, once I hacked down an Allen wrenchto a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes likea dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was solean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and evenbackfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific, nohesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with noneed to rejet from the factory settings!I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchersout there, but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began toget worried. But it all went back together again, and runs like adream, so I am feeling pretty happy.Now all I have to do is install my BUB pipes and try to pass the NHNoise Gestapo Test!Russ Hughes  '92 FXSTC  DoD# 6022(10E20)"Love ...yeah, that's the feeling you get when you like somethingas much as your motorcycle."                                --Sonny Barger

It's amazing how solid a grip you have on thehandle bars that your passenger does not. Don't make her feel likeshe's going to slide off the back, and "snappy" turns for you aresickening lurches for her. In general, it feels much less controlledand smooth as a passenger.

 31I can't help myself.I've tried to be rational, to look the other way,but everytime it happens, its uncontrollable.I hate pre'80s motorcycles.At first I thought it was a phase.  I though I wouldget used to them.  It didn't happen.  I tried gazingat CB750s and 900 customs, but each time I sadisticallypictured them being hurled off of large precipice(I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering andtaking holiday snaps, but I can't figure that part out).What am I to do?  Everytime I read a .sig containing some spoked wheel wonder, I shudder and feel pity thatthe poor soul has suffered enough.  I imagine the ownerscrapping out his (or her) living in a discarded Maytagrefridgerator box, tucked in next to their CX500.I'm hoping for some deliverance.  I had in the past loathedthe Milwaukee machine, but I can actually begin to understandsome of the preaching.

If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal!

All this aboutHarleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away theknocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-) According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is areal dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

That statement must therefore say that any argument in favorof seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argumentfor lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgumentin favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it isa non-seqitur.Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike,skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewirethe basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general publicbuying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activitywould be next is unlikely.--  | Terry Cunningham terry@rsi.prc.com | "Donuts!

 13There was an article in one of the U.K. dailies this weekabout a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off thefield after a collision with a Ford Sierra cage.Seems the cage driver wanted to turn around, but needed todrive onto the pitch to do this, so he waited till the balland most of the players were up the other end. Unfortunately,as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back downthe pitch, the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal, straightinto the cage!

It feelsgood for the passenger to stretch her arms, and a shoulder massage feelsgood too, but the shoulders are connected to the arms, and the arms tothe handlebars...  Should you hit the brakes, the pressure on the shoulderscan make steering interesting.Bundle her up if it's cold, make sure she has good gear (say it again),an pat her thigh to let her know all is great.Good luck!Mike

When it runs, it runs well. > Good point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things which come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Letsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or thevacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enoughto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, and as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the correct size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the outputside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Makesure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check for air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there isa vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the controlhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there is something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, I would be typing all day to list them all! Here are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valveand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up theairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there arequite a few on each carb.I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If AmericanHonda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB andcall the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recallit off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few dayslater a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I likedthe support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!Buy the service manual on the F2, it is an invaluable source of informationfor working on your bike and I might add, trouble shooting!

You can't handle it?We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitationalconstant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping,no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum caninepsychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also, recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing aninstinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger.The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing itsinexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).> You have, I presume, thumbs? Grapple with it and tear it's head> off!My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by toomany sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard.There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near mycar and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeonof dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement andconfusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leaptto its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally looking back at me.  "Seven at One Blow!" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishingmy Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environsof my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparentlyknew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torqueaccurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.

 29  Grf. Dropped my Shoei RF-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it...  So I cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes.  Then, while it was drying, I realized that I was out of smokes and that my cage is not currently running... So I "had to" take my bike down to the store. Not wanting to mess up my paint job, I said "Well, heck. I can just use my old helmet".... this is your standard el cheapie openface...    I didn't notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei, but switching back was really bad...   1) Doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to back... 2) With a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, I normally ignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish... with this one, taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind.      The question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... What are some guidelines? Should I just pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (XL), or should I maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely passenger?

I kid you not.This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbinglayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner linercompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged ordelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many yearsfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can loseup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I havea video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, andother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when thecomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriouslydegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of"parking your lid" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under thecomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantlydamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.--Jerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD #18Chemistry Dept., Harvard Univ.

 28Distribution: caMessage-ID: <1qjfsk$ibe@apple.com>I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictoryadvice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got anopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information isextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don'tknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle codeonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in awide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear anyadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what reallyhappens.  Read "Fight Your Ticket" too, but don't miss the littlesection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you'rebasically screwed.As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here inCalifornia.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses andrevealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped withthe maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - themessage clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public tryinghis own cases.So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take trafficschool if you can.  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyercan present the exact same case as you, the difference is thesentence.-- Paul Thompson    Apple Computer

Don'ttry that with a good'ole boy in Texas.I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idioticand senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walksback (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since thefreeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, "Stick thatfinger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down yoursorry-ass throat."  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundredcars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-redwith anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided not to shoot me./-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\|                                                                ||     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      || '90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               || '86 BMW R100GS | \\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/

 23After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HDSlash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning todo anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with noproblem at about 97 dB.Two points:First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, anddoing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhancedthe dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, makesure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away fromthe body.Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruisingthrough town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thatsa more throaty, purring, rumble.  When you open her up to >3000 RPMthey emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar.

The other morning I went to do a lane changeon the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but farenough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in sameposition, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decideI have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 milestaying ~200feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. Thisguy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire &his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off tehthrottle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes aroundme and cuts me off big time.

Cops are not theonly ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone whowitnesses a crime can do so.Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them adescription of the car and the license number, and tell them thespecific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fillout the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system anyticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have toappear in court to prosecute.

Though thisis a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highlyrecommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.

In order to get to the right place, Ishould clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreationarea.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and mayhave been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook isabout 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needlesoverlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonablymaintained (I ran it about 70mph).Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on the world.

If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to getmy adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (forme) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in acage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the lastvehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerkwaiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossingillegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.--Denis McKeongalway@chtm.eece.unm.edu

Meaning: would gases "so far" down the line (the canister)>really have an effect on the exhaust stroke?  Do the gases really >compress that much?    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulsesin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to forceair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intakevalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is onlythe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over afterthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on theintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowingatmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no timedoes the pressure ever become "negative", or even approach a goodvacuum.2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in thecombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system upto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volumeof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volumethat must flow through the intake, because of the temperaturedifference and the products of combustion.3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have startedpaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almightyhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almostzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows verywell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will makevery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is_much_ louder than the stocker.4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little differencewas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At anygiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be iton the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | "You can't wear out       || davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        || '88 K75S  '48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|| '75 R90S(#151) '72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They're built like rocks || '65 R50/2/Velorex  '57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     ||       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It's the Harleys that     || My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief."        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, callsome insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure thanyou might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)>>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to getboth feet on the ground when you stop. The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle SafetyFoundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completionof such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach youto ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.Alan

It is a little known fact that a dog willinvoluntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. Iwas told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist andforce it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and becomemomentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor andhave our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog'sdisorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses intounconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run likethe wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be reallypissed.OOOOOOOpsssss.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which Icontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true thatthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriateflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actuallythat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite andboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, hasa few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already stronglyidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone'spersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leadsto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul mybig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word whichactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counterto my use and flamage in general.In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it maybe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarilyweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful norapplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with aflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyonewho looks like you, too.-----Tommy McGuiremcguire@cs.utexas.edumcguire@austin.ibm.com"...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information,identifying it as personal and as independent of IBM...."

 44For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to thinkabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are ratedat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery tothe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relaypins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and useda crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the frontfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tubeframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing todo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the twovertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairingfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.The compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long.The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is smallso there should be plenty of good places for it.I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps tomount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either sidejust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of thehorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to wherethe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enoughroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nicecut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks outabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you lookclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straightahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can tryto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint themfirst.How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They soundmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse hasnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even thoughthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keepingthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering tothose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

It's a seperatecompany from the RR Aero-Engine company.  I think that the governmentown a stake.

 16Nntp-Posting-Host: os-d.isc-br.comAnyone in Europe got any advice for a US citizen whose going to be livingand working in Italy for a year and wants to buy a motorcycle there?  AnItalian friend just arrived here in Washington State to work for two years,and she's finding it very very difficult to obtain car insurance.  So Ithought I'd ask...I have a US license, with motorcycle endorsement (unlimited displacement),and have had for 30 years.  I am also a Washington State Motorcycle Safetyinstructor, if that info might help.I will post a summary, even if it's just of my own personal experience in buying a bike and getting it insured after I get to Italy.--H.

 59My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma orsomething. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using theapproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, itdidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to myhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation tothe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation tothe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent toharm.But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of theroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mphfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on theleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned hehad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. Isaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I tookthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg wasdriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanentmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I thinkI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of thismoment is hazy.I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. Theapologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cutmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in myshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike nevermoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bikeoff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from somegut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped mehere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could haveprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is notnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I wasriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened ifit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with thethought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of ablind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways arelong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?I eagerly await comment.Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to RideKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work toDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame toryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . . * SLMR 2.1a * "He's hurt."

I thinking about gettinga 100cc bike ( Don't Laugh ) just to get "Streetwise" and to take my test, thento get a bigger one ( 400 to 600 cc ).Now I have been told I don't have to do the CBT but what will I haveto do to get a full licence ?Thanks in advancedLeigh --********************************************************************************      ** Leigh Dodd      ** Engineering and Applied Science (EaPS)      ** University of Sussex,      ** Brighton BN1 9QH, UK      ** phone: 44 273 606755 Ext. 2616       ** fax: 44 273 678399      **      * * JANET: leighd@uk.ac.susx.eaps      ** INTERNET: leighd@eaps.susx.ac.uk      **      ********************************************************************************

If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller whichmakes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until theclearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten up, but I didn't think these kind could.Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for 30K on this bike andthey are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter...What's the deal?

But did the Hurtstudy make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure*to swerve? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen, riderswill almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply becausethe instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rideseverything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusivemanouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?

I sold my (well maintained)'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushingsand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve coversto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it wasmint.   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12kmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They allsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintainit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If myVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.Good luck, _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________|                                                              || Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    || Hewlett-Packard Co.

So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can'teven protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come outwith it.See, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and thecordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to puta rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into atruck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.Since that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain orcable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go onto the next bike.(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)|Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off|by such a trival tactic.

If we don't know what you are talking about,we can't very well guard against it, can we?For my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarmwith pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&Cinsurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of peopleabout.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention ofstealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,they'll set off the alarm.)That's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep itsactual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody wouldWANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would makea profit on the deal.  :-)Seriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and acurb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cablelocks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike orthe cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friendcome buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  Theonly thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).Oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, andplace them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.That's the best that I can think of.

Hence, any apparent>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling>characteristics.OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for whyone can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be todesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, andsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those ofus who have bikes are familiar.Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on itsown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have toget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patchesto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have toremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike thesame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patchforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if itwas the rotation that did it.Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude anddirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits themabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just lookingfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and notsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-skior skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arrangedlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something likethat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to tryone of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy ina bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles verymuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do havecountersteering.Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that havemotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know whatreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observationsof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle'sbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.I've        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada

Itis made of 3/4" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,professionals can open it rather easily:1) Freeze a link.2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, arefrightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which isanywhere from 1/2" to 7/8" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shieldedin a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-typelocking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it'smore difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flatin bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8" model).All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.Later,-- Chris BeHannaDoD# 114          1983 H-D FXWG Wide Glide - Jubilee's Red Ladybehanna@syl.nj.nec.com          1975 CB360T - Baby BikeDisclaimer:  Now why would NEC  1991 ZX-11 - needs a nameagree with any of this anyway?

Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first timeout too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.

You can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying the threads.  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole.

We'll be riding some twisty, > fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).> An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.Owww.Well, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I startedriding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passengerseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren'teven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and myback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of thereasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he hada BMW. :)I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountainsor some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on   the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider  asks you to :)- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably  consistent shifting style).  Avoid "helmet bonk."  Helmet bonk is   when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It  gets old real fast.- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be   sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed   for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.-- *********************************************************Laura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.comwriter of trifles in shadows and blood*********************************************************

 63csundh30@ursa.calvin.edu (Charles Sundheim) writes:>Some potentially cool story stuff here... Do share the details.HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55It's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding dayof spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Graball your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premiumor better.  Head out.In Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town ofGilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.Having just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take itfor a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, Iwent into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,and started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything feltjust right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for abit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mphgrab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and failto notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twistthe throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and seejust how well she's been put back together.At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender wasflexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed myhelmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fannypack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooperpulled in all hot and flustered."Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?""Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,not the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, andI'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.""My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me whyI shouldn't give you a ticket?""Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population andtraffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protectivegear that safety demands?" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)"Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?"<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>"Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years."<compare riding stories><pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>"So why were you out here?""I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right throughme.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holdsup out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do thisevvery year when I rebuild her.""Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highwayto do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highwayagain I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now getout of my sight before I write you a ticket.""Yes, officer.""And kid, keep your eyes open out there..." <drives off>And that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.I don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu ><  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

I would be very interested in hearing suggestions of roads/routes/areas that you would consider "must ride" while on the way to Knoxville.I can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PMon 5/25.  That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on the way.By the way if anyone else is going, and would like to partner for the ride down, let me know.  I'll be heading east afterward to visit family, but sure don't mind company on the ride down to the Rally.  Depending on weather et al. my plan is motelling/tenting thru the trip.From the Rally I'll be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway, then jogginginto West Va (I-77) to run up 219 -> Marlington, 28 -> Petersburg, 55E -> I-81/I-66E.

I've oftencontemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the throttle, but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would unballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I'veemployed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dogattacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs atonce while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock, but noblood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (aftercomplaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs;no more dogs, no more attacks. The telephone worked much betterthan the tire pump.Eric Bong DoD #02701986 FZ7501987 FZR7501991 VFR750

 29This summer (~July 20) my wife (Michelle) and I will be in Bostonattending my brother's wedding.  After the wedding we are planningto motor up to Bar Harbor, Maine to visit some relatives for a fewdays.  Our summer would be *made* if we could find a bike (or bikes)to borrow or rent to ride up to Bar Harbor and back.Here's some important details:  I've been riding for ~11 years,(my own bikes for the past 7 years), Michelle has been riding for thepast 6 years (her own bikes), I've only been involved in one accidentwhich was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, I currently owna BMW R90, Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago 700, we prefer cruising overracing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured,and we're nice people.So, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would haveto be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat) that theywould be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in July, Michelle and I wouldbe eternally grateful. In addition to our friendship, you would alsohave the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis.In exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinnerand an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing tocough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires orsomething.Also, any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would begreatly appreciated.Thanks,Scott Brandt

 28My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run.A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dogangrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then startedafter yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell)and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, Ipulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar ofthe pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell)and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. My second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled thecarcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely overthe dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4lumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going. AfterI got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck tothe bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.-- =============================================================================Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX)      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.

 9What size dirtbikes did you ride? and for how long? You might be able toslip into a 500cc bike. Like I keep telling people, though, buy an older,cheaper bike and ride that for a while first...you might like a 500 Interceptoras an exampleNathanielZX-10DoD 0812AMA

I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was unwise to buy secondhand - stuff like parachutes, toilet paper, condomsand motorcycle helmets...Seriously though, why take the risk? You are extremely unlikely to geta good-fitting secondhand helmet, cos life just doesn't work like that!And as Lisa says, you never know where it's been before...
 38Hi.I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.They are.  There's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart aroundliquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "LOOK" a lotmore effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initialappearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally functional.Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, andthe cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the raindressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers giveme a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentiallyinflammatory action at stoplights.I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on mybody) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).My first post.
