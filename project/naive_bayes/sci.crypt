Problem is, the government is admitting thatthey hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice departmentwill be using the keys to listen in on "illegal activities."  Manypeople are really scared about such an initiative because it isa major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on thingslike email if you read the press release.  The project was developedby NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that thegovernment claims are needed to break the code.  They claim thatthese keys will be handed to two different companies, and when theyget a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip),they have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holesthrough and through the press release official version and shown howit is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and I have given the simplifiedversion.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, andnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This systemmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would nowonly have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bitswouldn't turn up anything interesting.   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, butI'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancywhich was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key searchtake far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim thatthe real keysize can be verified externally.Andy Lattoandyl@harlequin.com

It is still used in some workstations,notably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraphacquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to NationalSemiconductor several years back.When I first saw "Clipper Chip" in the announcement, I immediatelythought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I'm not alawyer.

I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboycops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for morepolice agencies to "go rogue" and try to get keys through more efficient(but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said:   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to        decipher the message?   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.        ^^^^^^^^^^^The clear implication is that there are "legal" authorizations otherthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  Theremay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in whichkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellentposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  Theyalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  Thereare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to accesspolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may bevery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have suchevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutionalrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've "retired" from intelligenceagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.Don't think it'll happen?  Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professionalorganization, which for years kept "Red Files" on thousands of suspected commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standardsof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because theyhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendshiprally was happening -- the police went around writing down licenseplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on anymore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapesas well.)Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't needto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) will be a moral dilemma.Clipper will make criminals out of cops.

No, it's not acceptable if it's part of your loginprocess. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source ofpseudo-random information, do the right thing and pass it through acryptographic hash function, not a compressor. Aside from the factthat it will run faster, it will give better results (think of acryptographic hash as a function that "distills" randomness).Something along the lines of etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5should do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makessure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K.

(3) The President, by implication, mayintend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy butdo not have a key-escrow system.I want to see an organization which will combat such statements.Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than skimasks do.

Symposiumproceedings will be published by the Internet Society.  Topics for thesymposium include, but are not limited to, the following:*  Design and implementation of services--access control, authentication,   availability, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation   --including criteria for placing services at particular protocollayers.*  Design and implementation of security mechanisms and support   services--encipherment and key management systems, authorization   and audit systems, and intrusion detection systems.*  Requirements and architectures for distributed applications and   network functions--message handling, file transport, remote   file access, directories, time synchronization, interactive   sessions, remote data base management and access, routing, voice and   video multicast and conferencing, news groups, network management,   boot services, mobile computing, and remote I/O.*  Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as   -- very large systems like the international Internet, and   -- high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds now being built.*  Interplay between security goals and other goals--efficiency,   reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and low cost.GENERAL CHAIR:   Dan Nessett, Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryPROGRAM CHAIRS:   Russ Housley, Xerox Special Information Systems   Rob Shirey, The MITRE CorporationPROGRAM COMMITTEE:   Dave Balenson, Trusted Information Systems   Tom Berson, Anagram Laboratories   Matt Bishop, Dartmouth College   Ed Cain, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency   Jim Ellis, CERT Coordination Center   Steve Kent, Bolt, Beranek and Newman   John Linn, Independent Consultant   Clifford Neuman, Information Sciences Institute   Michael Roe, Cambridge University   Rob Rosenthal, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology   Jeff Schiller, Massachusetts Institute of Technology   Ravi Sandhu, George Mason University   Peter Yee, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationSUBMISSIONS:  The  committee seeks both original technical papers andproposals for panel discussions on technical and other topics of generalinterest.

We live inthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow databaseget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly wereI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrowhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes ofserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, butthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as thepopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes foreach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single veryvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but whocares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in mypocket on two 8mm tapes.Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the wholedatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocksin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every dayby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so conveniencewill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. Atsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabytetapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight willdoubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that "can't" is aprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys forevery person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, youneed the "master key" two -- but thats just ten bytes of informationthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the databaseisn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversialpolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, theones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of theevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do havea big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrialsecrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although whyour companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is leftunexplained by those that point out this threat.) Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSAand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happenedmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on somefraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands onthe escrow databases.We crypto types are all taught something very important at thebeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on theeasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on asecret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that ourteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets theywould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 millionClipper chips.I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing thisdoesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are toomany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspectthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they aredoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continueto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspectthat they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they cantry to delay things as long as possible.Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitablebureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believethat this scheme might give people some security, even as theirsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness ofit all.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

That wouldmake most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedurebefore key exchange, the "official" chips would only work with other"official" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes "physicallyidentical clone versions" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn'tbe necessary.Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK ---since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal.Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one "secret"80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security.Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the systemis compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's truewith a secret algorithm.Incidentally, what's to keep a "secret algorithm" from using the secretSK as the main key, with UK being only marginally important.

This proposal to establish a secret government designedcryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voiceencryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this programstrongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between thelegitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizenmay gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial numberwhich is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?______________________________________________________________________________Well heres a letter, I didnt spell check it since I dont know how in EMACSso you might want to do that.

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.Contents:* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the  readers want to see.* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your  postings in the right group.  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the  introductory textbooks.  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily  answered on your own.  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated  in some areas.)  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more  layer of complication and come back for another round.  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope  of this FAQ.  Among professionals, a common rule of thumb is that if you want to  design a cryptosystem, you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst.

I have>not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been>reported, but I could have easily missed it.Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legalityof other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seenhave been weasel-words ("more plans in the future, etc"), but nothingthat could be taken as a "NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)".  Ihave heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress haslanguage that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regardall systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystemsnot trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keyswhich one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted byfolks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLYbut by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELYoutlawed for all intents and purposes.Now, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now.Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLYoutlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,screwdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty muchat the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individualpossessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routineuse of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need'(gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caughtusing them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.In other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremelysensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strongsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,not personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded asa 'legitimate NEED': "Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate lawenforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be soconcerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personalsecrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planningto conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHINGTO HIDE, HMMMM?"I expect that initially there will be some people selected either atrandom, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS aboutthis... (mega ':-('s)One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response thatthere is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (anargument used in the abortion debate):  "You do NOT have a right to havesecurity that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'" (as suggestedin the Clipper Press Release).This, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not onlyfor crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of bothsafe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privatelyowned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...I cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easilydeclared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It wouldsimply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. Asimple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations aremainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agentswould go something like:"We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bankaccount, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless youhave a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with youracquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealerstools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... nodecent American Subject would be against these noble causes..."."Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only sayingyour HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doingSOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'.Only a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>"."Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOTapply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>"."If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court toPROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead,we have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized,no car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and yourless-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practicaldifficulties <grin>...".THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY howthe logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has beenused to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found onthe property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff inthat dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence fordealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust anotherday, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...Ob Disclaimer (of course)...Ok, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculationson what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiturecases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies,or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or whodo not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas wherethey are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to beable to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East,like NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).  These people have thechoice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threatsof pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case...All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behindthe Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.Point is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all tootypical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anythingthat the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?

Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paperthat came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer CommunicationsReview and Usenix.  For that matter, it was loudly discussed on theKerberos mailing list even earlier.The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to dowith bad password selection.I'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attackspossible on DES.  I'm quite dubious that private research labs knowthem.  And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite wellestablished; see, for example, the Garon and Outerbridge paper in theJuly '91 Cryptologia.  You're not going to do it in an hour with only``rather powerful DES hardware''.  I'll leave the arithmetic as anexercise for the reader.  On average, you'll need to do 2^55 trials.Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs, and forhow many such engines are used.

If it is onlyused for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or fileencryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-producedstandard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited toeasy-to-break inverters.Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto fore-mail and files, let's focus on this.One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal islimited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposalless threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have nosecure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a "goat" caneavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular andcordless phones.-------Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly securewithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businessesconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanesesecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to makeavailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted tohave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price ofdepositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliableescrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of theweek, and that system has worked pretty well.From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns thatneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But inreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DESand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarlyskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should bechecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have tobe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keyspursuant to a legitimate court order.

The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to letthemselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985the New York Times reported that government investigators brokeup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticatedequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring toeavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrestthem.     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said "There are a lot ofmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have thesignals intelligence operation of this group."     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people whohave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecurecommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip willonly increase their numbers.     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through theuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutionaland civil liberties questions involved.     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used asan investigative tool by the local "law-enforcement" people.  Isuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information andshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep theconviction rate high.     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country(even with a court order obtained by showing "probable cause") isbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency andwhat is ethically and morally right.     I think that the same question of expediency versus moralityshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  Ivote for morality.     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threatto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip isnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the WhiteHouse press release I came away with that impression.     To most of the American public, the word "hacker" hasrightly or wrongly come to mean "high tech adolescent vandal".It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.cryptregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals whohave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issuessurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother doesnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  Iwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech VolsteadAct.     The high speed digital communications revolution is comingat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the sameway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA shouldevaluate another approach.     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographicstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message outregarding the constitutional issues involved.     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi celavous concerne, cheri?

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea todevelop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwiseprobably become illegal pretty quickly here...It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's neededis a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codecfunctions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and havea good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in themiddle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work ona byte stream.With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatiblemodems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 onthe cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to getthe price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nastyhome RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I boughtfor 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software(which I don't).The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.Economics, I'm afraid.However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even withthe bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speechover a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should startthinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatiblefor everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet forall our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]G

And key size is one of the things that can beverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into thechip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to theoutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the outputbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case thatsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense thatthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% outputchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't thinkNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts seethe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biasedsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committeecan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verifiedlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least somesecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into withoutit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committeemembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, whichyou have to XOR together to recover the program...Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But thepeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto gameand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're notgoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibilityis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've liedabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absenceof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one willbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other thingsanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystemwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it tookfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirelypossible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for justsuch reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain toa Senator...).> Anyway, its looking like the> keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA> can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number.I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the sameescrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seensomething about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technicalinformation post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.--Steve Bellovin

I know that factoring and breaking RSA arenot proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not torepeat this every time.I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group''property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I havethought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that acryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.

Simple -- if you have a choice between: 1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy     behavoir, or 2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under     the control of the user,which would you choose?  At most, the American government can deny thischoice to American citizens (and probably not that, if the glorious successof the War on Drugs is any example); it can't do much about the global market.

Oh>well.I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant.We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannothappen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every daybecause the government justifies doing some end-run around the protectionsby a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in thefuture possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possessionof 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, commoncomputer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client statesas far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be farbehind - only a few years.Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatensones rights in this thing.For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longerbe private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allreadyis very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government todecide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomesguilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  Thephrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants itto be defined as.Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you andyour past can be put on it, and you can only take the government'sword as to what is really on it (since they will be the only oneswith the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn'tthat nice?While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the ownerknows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities hasgone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, theycan get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys toa safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keysobtained from the suspect.This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make anypriviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningfulpolitical dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and allof that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they willby into this monstrosity.

The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (comparedwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is16 Mbits a second. [...]F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chipsN, a 30-bit serial numberU, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chipThe key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are thenfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  Three questions:1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:E[M;K] = 64 bitsE[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bitsE[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?      All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,   or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?   Does the block have to be present at all?   Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's    limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness   (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets   it recognize a valid E[K;U].)      In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?   (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.   On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,   like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?Thanks!--#Pray for peace;      Bill# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ#              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461

The user can choose anew session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows threekeys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a wholeknows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted asE_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it.The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens whensomeone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get Mthe receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C.The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computedfrom C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``keyescrow'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted?---Dan

As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes      with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or servicesoperated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,and they generally can confiscate the equipment as "evidence"(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning todevelop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compelyou to tell them information you know, such as the encryption passwordfor the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a newsituation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are nolaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keysfor their own files without giving them to you.Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business recordssubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think theywere able to do much about it.It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customersbased on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausibleextension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.--#Pray for peace;      Bill# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ#              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461

The purpose of this chip is twofold:    1) Transmit Channel    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number    unrecoverable with just the system key2) Recieve Channel    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number    is necessary for local operation).This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets moreinteresting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers anda spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you couldlie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you couldsuccessfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating theformat of your own serial number.Makes you wonder whats being hidden here?   Seems  like the secrecy isto prevent you from lying about who you are.

If the system is really secure, thenwhy does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plentyof encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, butI certainly can't think of any honest ones.Next, you assume we can "trust" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked,EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt issaying "Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us."  Bullcrypt. And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assumethat the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The casein Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberatelyfraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on thisscore.Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?

I guessthis statement doesen't contradict what you said, though.--- cut here ---        WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a freshstart, President Clinton told delegates to the National Federationof Police Commisioners convention in Washington.        In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural,Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War ``would makeeverything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practicalpurposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasizedhis view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has triedit, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.''The audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spellfiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequentlywith applause.        Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows theoutline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level DrugCzar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did,however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcementmethods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''Clinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strictcontrols on data formats and protocols, and require the registrationof so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drugdealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said theapproach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of undergroundeconomic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders wholive in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton lastNovember, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense ofurgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates oflegalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good atmaking noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people casttheir ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that theadvocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''

I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lotof ground.  Some of the information in the posting requires someclarification, and I would like to answer some of the questionsraised on sci.crypt.     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Ourtwo main products at this time are a PC based securecommunications program called SECOM and a general purposeencryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication linkbetween two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines.  Itsupports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboardto screen "chat".  It has its own proprietary communicationsprotocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  Allthough it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to becontinuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.     When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented touse DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek exportapproval for the product because it was perceived that theoverseas market was a large one and provided a good marketingopportunity.     We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted generalexport approval for anything using DES.  All though the reasonfor this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have somethingto do with secret government to government agreements which arestill in effect.     In any event, the decision was made to develop a new anddifferent algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This wasthe reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.     At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  Thepreliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is tomake it public once the patent process is complete.  All thoughone can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoingsecret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it isnecessary to let people "shoot at it" over an extended period oftime to prove its worth.     In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it wasnecessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details ofthe program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had afinished product to submit.     Let me state unequivocally that there is NO "back door" tothe program or the algorithm.  Secured CommunicationsTechnologies is a closely held private company andNSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any waywhatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.     From a practical business standpoint, we are interested inselling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and aback door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy ourcredibility and our business.     With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we setout to talk to a number of potential customers for encryptionproducts and systems.  We were able to identify several commonthreads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design ofa chip with the encryption algorithm "cast in silicon" andcertain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfillthe broad range of requirements that we identified.     We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In apress release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:          "It seems as if the government has an unlimited source     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American     Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security     Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic     spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip     intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying     activities."     If they had asked me to put a "back door" in NEA I wouldhave told them to g__ f____ed.     Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES,RSA, IDEA, Diffy-Hellman, PGP, RC2, RC4, or whatever?  I don'tknow and probably never will.

Is it just to gain an effectiveincrease in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch?  (If so, why use80 bit keys?)  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm, it'snot really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier toguess S1,S2.    Why are N1, N2, and N3 formed as they are?  It would be facinating tosee the Skipjack algorithm, to look for ways of attacking it that requirethree ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.    Where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with theserial number to form N1,N2,N3 come from?  Are they changed from chip tochip, or session to session?  (Even if they're published in the NY Times,if SkipJack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks, when using triple-encryption, then there's no break in security.  But why allow that kindof weird format?  If those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits, thenmaybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack, ifit exists, can't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole productionrun of these chips....)

Even if we assume that these "trusted agents" are really enteringa wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all thetime to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are notdoing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitryat carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably bepunching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could programthe chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values theyare feeding into the system.S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are allcompromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use ahardware true random number source.  There isn't a random numbersource *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministicfrom the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.Nope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access -the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, andostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything*on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want awarrantless tab in exchange for favours.G

This was two years ago.I don't believe you, and I don't believe your friend.Why? Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readilyavailble. Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret,he was bullshitting you.Now, it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* ofthe Kerberos protocol. For instance, using a weak RNG to generate keysmight cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the otherkind who's name I can't remember). However, this is not what wasclaimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES, which is notknown to exist in the open literature.Don't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be. However,cracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the crackingmachine than ANY organization I know of has available.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree   to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now,and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness todecide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear,and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long asthey provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication thatthey're considering banning alternatives.Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal -you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except tothe government's friends (e.g. the Australian government)you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission,and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies makesure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can'tstart offering a secure service.  --#Pray for peace;      Bill# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ#              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461

My biggest concern isn't that the escrow house couldbe compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised willbe kept secret.  The keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour C-SPAN coverage.

Many file formats can be written with "gaps" in them to hideother data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hiddenby dispersing it amongst the "legitimate" data.  The hidden data would onlyshow up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would beindistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s) would revealthe presence of an "illegal" document.If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend havethe uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do Ihave the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to "escrow" all our datafile formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors andcatch phrases?I think that it's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach byreplacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then re-ask thequestion.

If the law enforcement wants my traffic, they can recordit, then get a search warrant, and get the keys FROM ME, just like theywould the keys to a stout private safe, etc. (Lets say I suspect thatthere is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level, with no warrant,say for NSA scanning for keywords, etc., and the government has abusedgreat power in the past...).So I say "Mr Vendor, I want something different, independent.

That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSESwant to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here...You see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I haveseen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at leastappear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedomfrom Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves againstviolent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', theyarrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had todepend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smartID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial ofmeans to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now),it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to traceEVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would takeis requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions...and with no effective data protection, and with the people suitablydisarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, nowwould there?

(or is that no longer regarded as necessary,seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, theAdministration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, thenspringing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLEto me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved wereNOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a littlebit curious, don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not votefor come election time...Yes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall itwas you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (couldhave been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  Ialso recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-bereally didn't care (or were not told, or both).From what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don'twant the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don'tthink I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext.Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serioustrade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security.Given enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crookedjudge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't behard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and theGovernment with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You knowthe first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing forTHEIR communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhapsto order a pizza).Tell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity,someone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desireto have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of anunconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-doorraid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools',using civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need toPROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen?I have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all thepublic magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how greatthis is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusionof privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to letus 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I amcorrect here?Please answer these questions.  As citizens of the United States, wehava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us haveout of the goodness of their hearts...Funny thing, though - with all these proposals, I don't feel ONE BITsafer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug.

They probably can'ttell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until theyget their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to useencryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoidthis will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the useof an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statisticalproperties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could thendetect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increasethe measured entropy of the input.

Not necessarily.  For instance, in the system outlined in the May 1993issue of "Byte", the process of getting one's public key listed for generaluse involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies, whichdo calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers ofthe public key directory, which combines these results into your listedpublic key.

If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the    access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort    would make "compatible crypto chips for which no key had been   escrowed".

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                               Dorothy Denning                           Revised, April 21, 1993INTRODUCTIONOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bringtogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary programto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs oflaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryptionchip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach toescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts fromboth are needed to reconstruct a key.CHIP CONTENTSThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit blockencryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes ofoperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in ElectronicCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.Each chip includes the following components:   the Skipjack encryption algorithm   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chipThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They areimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as thetechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIPTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&Ttelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone andwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secureconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key Kwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes placewithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange canbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used toencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  Thetelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce twovalues:   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcementfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key Uconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the familykey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement afteran authorized wiretap has been installed.The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using thesession key:   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROWAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure CompartmentedInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF containsa laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chipsare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located atMykotronx.At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two keyescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unitkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are afunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N isfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a64-bit block R1:        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 andN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:          R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]         R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. Thefirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  Therest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrowagencies.As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they arewritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains afile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key partU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The thirddisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowingan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does notknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bitkey parts.  The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips areprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agentsleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that noinformation is left behind. The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in theroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back tothe escrow agencies. The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will notbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One orboth may be independent from the government.LAW ENFORCEMENT USEWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, theywill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to getaccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is inplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with theClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with thefamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a taphas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N isthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, whoreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORedtogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get thesession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this willbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATIONA successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the governmentand "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will includethe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), theSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fastexponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available fortesting on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready fordelivery in June or July.ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

Eventually the chips, developed by the government's NationalInstitute for Standards and Technology, would be used by commercial andprivate electronics communication users.   The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containingthe encryption devices would be assigned two unique "keys" - numbersthat will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.   The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that thekeys are deposited in two "key-escrow" data bases.

It couldjust say, "If you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluationcontracts with Aerospace and IDA."I am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonestfolk.  But since they are people, and people occasionally go bad, thesystem works better if organizations that you are depending upon to beindependent really are.And, of course, I speak for myself, not my employer.Lynn Grant

(1) Many people will read andremember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effectivelaw enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing toacknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryptionto ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, mayintend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy butdo not have a key-escrow system.I want to see an organization which will combat such statements.Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than skimasks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption whichensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key-escrow system.I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a``National Cryptography Association.''To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new organizationnecessary? Does it already exist?---Dan

Banks will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.Natural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the government databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" make no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular person, not on the particular modem or phone.

I wouldjust add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: thefifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  ("...nor shall any person .. . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...").Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would becivil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection.Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead tocriminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting partof all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as to the location of the child--this is routine.  A "computer crime" prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, where a suit by a party injured by "hackers" would not.  If I am accused, for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a "crime" in thetechnical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughtyboy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civiltrial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminalprosecution.

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites  is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who  has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.   Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses   (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.   Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to  aid remailer use).  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu  -----------------------------    Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.      elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu  -------------------------    Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus    <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.  hh@soda.berkeley.edu  hh@cicada.berkeley.edu  hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu  ----------------------    Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu   ----------------------    Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by    Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu   -----------------------------    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site    address for information.  Notes  =====    - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues    are wholly unresolved.    - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP    software (see the question on cryptography).   - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)    vary between sites.  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time._____<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?    Users  -----  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases    network traffic.  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'    hierarchy is preferred.  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even    future ones under the same handle.  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by    sending anonymized mail to yourself.  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.     Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating    his hardware, all for your convenience.  Operators  ---------  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or    lassaiz-faire?  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your    users trust you to protect them.  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is    your commitment to it?  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.     Consult a lawyer about your liability.  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If    possible, query group readers.  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.  Readers  -------    - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its    volume is heavy or increasing).  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,    harassment, extortion, etc.  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they    offend you personally.  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the    idea of anonymity itself.  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or    `conceivable' need exists.

The article concludes with a set of  > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous._____<8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:  > Try putting this in your kill file:  >     >   /Anon/h:j  >   /Anonymous/h:j  >   > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that  > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't  > kill followups.     Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.  _____<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through  servers like there's no tomorrow.''    Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''   K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus  against it.   K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was  created.''  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.    J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of  anonymity is also controversial.  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating  through many newsgroups.     The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his  detractors.  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.    Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,  etc.  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the  software to the public domain.  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and  encryption.

RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: "What is PEM?") RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc. The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.2)  How can I get RIPEM? RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the README file that this law not be violated: #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM. Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM. RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping distribute it. RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree.3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected, and help of users is invited.4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs. If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.5)  What is RSA? RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real plaintext. (See "What is DES?") Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message (See "What is a fingerprint, like MD5?") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered. RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information also may be in sci.crypt.6)  What is DES? DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA. RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, allowing the recipient to recover the DES key. DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability.7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key, only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication. MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example, RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy. MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator. MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321. There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true.8)  What is PEM? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115. RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read. RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server, the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM? This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310, the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key cryptography. This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are compressed with a patented algorithm.)11)  What about RSADSI/PKP? RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S. patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method      ("Diffie-Hellman")............................... No. 4,200,770      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus      and Method ("Hellman-Merkle").................... No. 4,218,582      Cryptographic Communications System and      Method ("RSA")................................... No. 4,405,829      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus      and Method ("Hellman-Pohlig").................... No. 4,424,414 PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.) PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents. RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography. However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing code.  RIPEM even won the "Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992" award.12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.13)  What is PGP? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA. A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM: - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without   a direct network connection. - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be   compatible with anything other than itself. - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its   patents to "make, use or sell" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without   either a license or written permission.  (See: "DISCLAIMER")   (See: "What about RSADSI/PKP?")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,    #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is   #contraband. - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places. Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program, which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to liability concerns.14)  What about RPEM? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM. Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons. RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.15)  What is MIME? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter.16)  What is TIS/PEM? Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH) rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know much more than that.17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM... You may wish to check the companion post "ripem-attacks" which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main "weak area" is probably key distribution.

The one most obviouslyapplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able tospecify the "similarity" of matches in the data.For example say you make up a password/phrase of "qimwe7l".Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is notin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it toen entry that could be varied by some "crack" program tobrute-force search for it?You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But agrep -3 "qimwe7l" bigwordandphraselistfinds that the pattern "qimwe7l" is too close to thepattern "imsel" (part of "himself" and a host of others),to be of any cryptographic value as a key.An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition ofletters like "teh" for "the".  A minimally acceptable passwordwould have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediatelyruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,say I want to find out what people think about Gibson'sSF book "Neuromancer" in the huge SF-Lover's archives.Even with an error distance specification as small asof "1" I will find all those people who think the titlewas "Necromancer" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLELat Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabeto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog orreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts thatdon't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changingthe pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to findNSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.You can also specify "fixed" areas: looking for licenseplate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,you might say:agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabasewill find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You canalso "weight" the relative "cost" for substiutions, additions,or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patternsfor a particular protein combination, you might know thatsome kinds of damage cause the "A" nucelotide to drop out morethan other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting-Dc where you set the "deletion cost" to count as "c" errors.A steganographic use (I even used "agrep -2 "<steg>eograp" E"just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionallyintroduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintextand then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots ofpossibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easyto abstract the "hits" into a useful form.  For example,agrep -d "^From" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From'that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase','Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude fasterthan the second-best similarity tool publicly available.As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docsto those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot doan anonymous FTP.Get this now.It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.Grady Ward, vendor to the NSA (and proud of it)-- grady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F

Then replace "prince" with"government" or "president", as appropriate, and read it again.  [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated byDaniel Donno.]In order to keep their lands secure, some princes havedisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within thecities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities againstthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those theyinitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others havedestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definitejudgements on all of these measures without considering the particularcircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shallnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itselfwill allow.To begin with, there has never been a case of a new princedisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, heproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make theirarms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects theyare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed byextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment ofthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, whilethe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added dutiesand dangers should receive advantages.  When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, byshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, youdistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you wouldhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already beendiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never begood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtfulsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquiredstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history isfull of examples proving that this is so.But when a prince takes posession of a new state which heannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm allthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquireit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to rendersoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms ofthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native tohis original domain....And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remindany prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitantsthat he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if thereason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfactionwith the former government, he will find it extremely difficult tokeep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If hewill carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawnfrom ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is mucheasier to win the favor of those who were happy with their formergovernment, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor ofthose who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him toreplace it.

The users key K which can bederived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encryptplaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message".     This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encryptedwith some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three partmessage is then encrypted by still another key.     My question is: What is a message?     For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitizedvoice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitizedand then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-securecommunications link.     Where is the three part message?  Is something appended toeach 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of thesession?     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, howdo they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip doesjust that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?     Any ideas?

Local law enforcement will be unable to performa wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possiblyincomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only theFBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seemsto be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.

The government decided to "discourage" them.Really, none of this stuff is especially hard. All you need for a trueprivate phone is an ISDN codec, a vocoder (either a chip orsoftware), an encryptor (a chip is fine, but software is more thanfast enough), a V.32 or V.32bis modem module, and maybe amicrocontroller to run the whole thing. Its easy to do, its cheap. Andany "normal" company trying to put one out will likely get a visitfrom the boys in the dark suits from Washington, just like Qualcommdid. I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because theirproducts are too expensive.However, no law yet stops one from building really private phones, inspite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new"crime bill" and in connection with the Clipper/Skipjack Big Brotherchip. Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this.

There isnot a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passesevery significant gateway or 'bone is captured for thecolligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared privatekey.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a privatekey corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed outby a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants,and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the useof the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group fornon-attendees could of course just be signed using the private keybut otherwises not encrypted.Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintainingmailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would beeasier to archive for people who might join a group "late" andwho might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysisto know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicizeavailable privacy measures on the internet.And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of suchkeys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge WilliamSessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having itcollected for them.-- grady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F

The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives younothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random)bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using +for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bitstrings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.

We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Congress??

[...bs about     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have     effectively done); They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.                         nor is the U.S. saying that "every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.                                                  There is a     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.Nice lullaby.

(Of course these could all bewrong.....) from                      THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                               Dorothy Denning                           Revised, April 21, 1993...The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit blockencryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes ofoperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in ElectronicCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.Each chip includes the following components:   the Skipjack encryption algorithm   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip...ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIPTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&Ttelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone andwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secureconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key Kwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes placewithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange canbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used toencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  Thetelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce twovalues:   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcementfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key Uconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the familykey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement afteran authorized wiretap has been installed.------------------suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, butdid not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F fromif law enforcement field    E[E[K; U] + N; F]not knowing N would might make this much harder.Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know Ufor a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for theother party.If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I couldmake my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F alsoallows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you aresaying but I could know who you are saying it too.Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots ofmessages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the keygeneration method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for thatmatter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will bechosen from know weak keys for the system.Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcementfor whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe thatit is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot ofpeople (more then 1) know what it is (and if some "panel of experts" isgoing to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forgetgrinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.jon

Remember, your letter  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may  even be a college student; if they don't understand it, your  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets.- Be concise; don't ramble.  Rants are *definitely* out of place.  Cite references, if necessary, but only use "accepted" references  like academic journals.  "My neighbor Jim" is *not* a real refer-  ence.  8)- Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters *really* understand  electronic communications.  Encourage them to pick up access  to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets.  Offer  to send them samples.  If you are in a position to do so, offer  them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your  systems.  Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in  town.  Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them  *will* give your opinions more credence.- In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing  with the issue.  If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee,  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.--Wesps> I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the    more traditional media, but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record    in the analogy department.  8)-- Rachel Elizabeth Morgan  --  4/13/93, 7:00 am    | Oh yeah, I can be reached as9 pounds 4 ounces (despite coming 3 weeks early) |     morgan@engr.uky.edu                                                 |-----------------------------To netters who gave constant encouragement and prayer - thanks for everything!

The way it works is as follows:  You generate your private key S, and break it up into pieces s1, s2, s3,s4, and s5, such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S.  You give each piece s1, s2, etc. to a different escrow agency.  The agencies each compute g^sn mod p, and forward the result to the publickey telephone book keeper.  The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p, reducesthe result to mod p, and this will be the user's public key.  Now, if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies, and the usercould give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted, the result wouldbe something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system.  I still don't think key escrow is a good idea, for both philosophical andsecurity reasons, but I do offer this suggestion simply to determine whetherescrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in goodfaith, or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selectedfor spinelessness in the face of official requests.

FACT SHEET                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENTThe President has approved a directive on "Public EncryptionManagement."  The directive provides for the following:Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryptionare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy ofcommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology torapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to theinfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in theinformation age.Despite its benefits, new communications technology can alsofrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticatedencryption can have this effect in the United States.  Whenexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligenceactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it hasbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conductelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate lawenforcement and national security interests, while at the same timeprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  Asencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,innovative approaches.In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government hasdeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy throughencryption that is substantially more robust than the currentgovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys neededto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keyswill allow the government to gain access to encrypted informationonly with appropriate legal authorization.To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collectand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmittedinformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITSThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,shall request manufacturers of communications hardware whichincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developedkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of lawenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed fromthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken toensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrowmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communicationshardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure thesecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I donot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or thegovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms thatare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-escrow system.KEY-ESCROWThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriateentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuitsinstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the keyholder must agree to strict security procedures to preventunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released onlyto government agencies that have established their authority toacquire the content of those communications that have beenencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The AttorneyGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by whichan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of suchcommunications.PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICESThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriateU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards tofacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fittedwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systemsthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect thisprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation ofa final standard within six months of this directive. The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices tothe extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conductlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for securelaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney Generalshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset ForfeitureSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.

The announcement wassilent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has beenobtained (by the authorities, by divorce lawyers, by the Mafia, by theFBI, by lost or stolen backup tapes, by the NSA, etc.). all previousconversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated, but knowingthe private key is believed by many commentators here to break thesecurity. No doubt more details will emerge.)So, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lotmore than merely replacing the phone.Sort of like saying to someone, "Oh, I copied your diary. But I'll buyyou a new one."And the system, if made mandatory (as I expect), will make suchstoring of conversations much easier, I fear. For one thing, thetransmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyonelistening, a kind of "Caller ID" and "Callee ID" on a grand scale.Also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting theprivacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be uselessencrypted junk. (This is a bit of a reach, I know, suggesting that theClipper will make security more lax...).Anyway, still lots of issues unresolved.-Tim May-- ..........................................................................Timothy C.

Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/schemeis to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange schemelike Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a sharedsession key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phonecompany or some other online central authority generates a session key andsends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble ofhaving some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company fora copy of the session key for each call.    Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy ofevery public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there willbe some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access toeveryone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to thesecurity of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use yourdesignated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.    It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you touse either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pairand verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to callmost people and establish secure communications....    --John Kelsey>I hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first>ones are released...

Can any crypto>implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not>available EVER be trusted?After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals,but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they should not; they should keep it proprietary. The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscombwas the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunatelyfor all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above questionmuch better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gainacceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessarycomplexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15 years.We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, inventedand proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined andvetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence byany of these.Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trustthe DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of thepublic scrutiny.(Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basisof authority alone.)We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can "break" theDES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time theycan "break" anything.  The important question is at what cost and inwhat time.The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so importantas what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand thecost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability ofany successor to overcome this knowledge gap.DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the centuryand the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.We are damned lucky to have them.William Hugh Murray, Executive Consultant, Information System Security49 Locust Avenue, Suite 104; New Canaan, Connecticut 06840                1-0-ATT-0-700-WMURRAY; WHMurray at DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL

David,  While I disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government,I think you have a good idea here. There is danger that, with funding comingfrom asset forfeitures, the government could continue to promulgate a badproduct in spite of poor acceptance.

That is, ignoring concerns about governmentintrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps toinvestigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five milliondollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, butI'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimatingthe costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all  phones with wiretap chips?- How much would it cost to make each chip?- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed  "law enforcement blocks"?- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each policeagency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, beingcharged their share of the full social cost of forcing communicationto be wiretap compatible?

If not, please do so before posting this misinterpretation again.>It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia, not for individuals >to carry handguns, grenades, and assault rifles.  The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that"the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, andhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.I quote:  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people  to keep and bear Arms ...."- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecutionfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had notpresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of thegovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held thatthe amendment protected the individual right to possess militaryweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfullygotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change theinterpretation.Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis: "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )You might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit aboutmilitias mean?"Well, "militia" in historical context basically means the whole of theadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of    the kind in common use at the time."- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationalebehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people tobear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of militarypower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, thegovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather thanthe other way around.   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on   any pretense, raised in the United States."     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it berepealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that itdoesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions havechanged and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagineit away.I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets getit out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it intalk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter withyou.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

I think this is going to be atough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot ofresources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They areserious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating SenateBill 266 in 1991.Possible actions to take in response:1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, andmore.2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science andtechnology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines ornewspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may beslow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical andarcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaminglibertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. 3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to yourMember of Congress in your own district, as well as your two USSenators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them oftechnology issues.  Talk to those aides.4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian partywould certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings ofthe Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has asurprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the politicalspectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Otheractivist groups that may someday find themselves facing a governmentthat can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends playthemselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if youwant to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) andComputer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assumingthese groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legalexpenses and lobbying.5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumablydevelop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should belobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for atelecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of yourcoworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and thenpresent your company's management with a united front of engineeringtalent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to yourmanagement, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Holdmeetings on it.6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrillatechno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology mightalso be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressedby Government action.  I will also be working to develop new usefultools for these purposes. 7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate onthis topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so wemay have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can'toutright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version ofthis Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared toanalyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want itmodified.-Philip Zimmermann

I was surprised to notice, however, that onequestion I might have expected to be asked was not:  "Are all forms ofstrong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal?"  Speakingof which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked ofany knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?

Ask yourself this.  Why would any privatesector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at leastpartially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would anyprivate sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properlyevaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware outthere not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clippersystems.  If not we're in trouble.Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd liketo think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never takenseriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You knowlittle about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first stepin the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banningor SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the "Clipper" system is easilyjustified "Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were tryingto subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternativeso use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever."How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providinglaw enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper systemthe only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administrationknows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it fordrug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrationscollective I.Q. is about that of a potato.Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy thestuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why thehell would they jump the gun?>My interpretation.>>Andrew>>>-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime>                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>>Isn't this just a little melodramatic?I really wonder.To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:The White HouseOffice of the Press Secretary c/o:Presidential Comment Line (fax)(202) 456-2461 April 17, 1993 Sir and/or Madam:  I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption andcryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life. It is apparent to me that those who drafted the "Clipper Chip Proposal" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the "Big Brother Proposal") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm depends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from "experts" without full disclosure is plain ignorance. In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how "tamper proof" the key escrows might be. I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the "Clipper Chip Proposal" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not utilize the "Big Brother Chip." Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like "harmony," "right to encryption," and "voluntary." It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is "I can't believe it's happening here."  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; "When is the Reichstag fire planned for?"

The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes fromFriedman:"No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes from someone who has already broken a very hard one."Historically, Friedman has been right.  It's really hard to developa good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to havebeen fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seemto be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries atpublic key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Mostif not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era werebroken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryptionhave been disappointing; the classic "A survey of data insecurity packages"in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of thepopular "security packages" of the late 1980s.        A new, proprietary algorithm?  No way.        If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it hasto be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently there'sa willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to beno problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms(I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.I can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out.John Naglep.s. No, I'm not thrilled with Clipper either, but that's a different issue.

A secret algorithm can still be secure,after all, we just don't know it.  Only our level of trust isaffected, not the security of the system.The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe tobe secure.They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than toprotect its security.  They want to protect its market share.If they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers wouldmake chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do notuse a key stored in escrow.  And of course, everybody would buy them.The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard thatyou can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to followtheir rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth andnail.Quite simply, with Clipper established, it would be much harder foranother encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones thatcan't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappablecryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of thepopulace.To get untappable crypto, you would have to build a special phone thatruns on top of this system, and everybody you talk to would have tohave an indentical one.That's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using itsvery special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of newtechnologies to control this one in a way they like.It's almost admirably clever.

The article was titled "Government slowlyeroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to thelate Leonard Read who        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and        then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as        with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken        a little bit at a time.The last line of the article says, "It's not too late for us, but thewater is getting pretty warm."  I'd have toagree that it's warm and theClipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.NOTE: followups redirected to alt.privacy.clipper---Jim  jdailey@asic.sc.ti.com   TI pays absolutely no attention to me or my opinions; therefore,   the foregoing information cannot possibly represent TI's viewpoint.

I expect that products using these chips will socket themrather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by theescrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to bereplaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatiblechip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it'snot possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the2 backdoor keys.   If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketingstrategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies eitherthrough bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact.(doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which wouldlikely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies wouldgo quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip,and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back-doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help growthe market demand for a secure alternative. I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will makefew friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe thatthe government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal.I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availabilityof such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability ofcertain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.Regards,Ian Ameline.(Of course the ramblings above have nothing to do with my employer, nordo I necessarily advocate doing any of the things described here -- Ijust believe that the events above are likely to take place)

On theother hand, assuming a legislative change, recording but not decryptingClipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the SupremeCourt, using the same reasoning (or the lack thereof...) by which theypermit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers.Incidentally, if we use that as our model, the Court will likely notuphold selective recording.  (On the other hand, I don't think they'vethrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet.  Must be that exception tothe Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill ofRights.)A lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how Clippertaps(or Tipperclaps, for encrypted music?) are used.  Don Alvarez showed inthe latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops fromreading traffic after their warrant expires.That is -- the cops send the LEF to the F-holder.  The F-holder stripsoff F, and sends U[K],N to the escrow agents.  They send either U or Kto the cops.  (Don says U, I say K.)  The cops can't use U in thefuture, because they can't strip off F.  The F-holder never sees U.  InDon's model, the escrow agents can't read the traffic, because theydon't have K; in my model, they have K, but not the message itself.And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI (theF-holder) are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules.  Thenet result is that by involving the F-holder and the escrow agents onevery tap, we can avoid extending permission to tap.

BrownSecretaryDepartment of Commerce14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NWWashington, DC 20236Dear Secretary Brown:   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption standard, based upon "clipper chip" technology, have raised a number of related issues.  The international competitiveness of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is a key factor that the government should consider when addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the nation moves forward in developing the national communications and information infrastructure, security of telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of users.   The "hacker" community can compromise the integrity of telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the network.  The people and businesses that use the nation's telecommunications network and the personal computers linked through it increasingly are demanding that information be protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. government customers, and another for private, commercial users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis of this issue, please respond to the following questions:1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST or the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the nature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how such experts will be chosen.2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the holders of the "keys" to decrypt scrambled data?  What procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to designate such key holders?3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the Administration contain a "trap door" or "back door," which could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to crack the code?4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used for communications will require new techniques and additional equipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid advancement of telecommunications technology?5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place on the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard in their equipment?6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the "clipper chip" technology on U.S. exports of computer and telecommunications hardware and software products?   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-of-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any questions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.Sincerely,Edward J.

This will prevent competitorsfrom coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government-installed "back door."  The strategy Brad describes will only work as longas the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the governmentchips.(It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Bradturns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to providetheir own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacyis still possible.  But the wording of several passages in the announcementmakes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)Hal Finney

Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often        blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme        Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend        off a bent cop.        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,        while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government        is getting in-your-face liberty.

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU isessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civilliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to getinvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with goodreason.When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that theauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from asecurity point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I alwaysfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fixthe problem.Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in abad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  Theauditee can say, "Well, you told us this way would be OK."  Itcompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor'sjob.Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half getsaway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civilliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendantand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at oneplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signedautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drumwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), andwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.I believe the difference between this situation and the key registrationsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payrollchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them againtoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they canbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves arelegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that couldput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLUconflict of interest.As always, my opinions are my own.Lynn GrantGrant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL

Definitions of basic terms. Beginner references. Cryptanalysis and theoretical/practical strength of ciphers.X-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part03Last-modified: 1993/4/15FAQ for sci.crypt, part 3: Basic CryptologyThis is the third of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.Contents:* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?* How does one go about cryptanalysis?* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are  relatively easy to break?* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both  cryptography and cryptanalysis.  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert  ciphertext into plaintext.  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,  eavesdroppers, or third parties.* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up  to the mid-60's.  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and  networks.  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.* How does one go about cryptanalysis?  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still  classified.  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this  brute-force search is impractical.      Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is  probably strong.  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).      A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he  doesn't have a chance.  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See  [KAH67].  * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are  relatively easy to break?  Some don't know any better. Often amateurs think they can design  secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst  could do. And sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody  to invest the work needed to crack a system.

Snefru.X-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part07Last-modified: 1993/4/15FAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash FunctionsThis is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answersevery 21 days.Contents:* What is a one-way hash function?* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?* What are MD4 and MD5?* What is Snefru?* What is a one-way hash function?  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the  same hash.  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the  signature can do the same thing.  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1  if and only if X = H(M).  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.* What are MD4 and MD5?  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is  available from [FTPMD].  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some  people refer to it as MD5.* What is Snefru?  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph  Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.  Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from  [FTPSF].

My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takesa second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all ofsolutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits offthe net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10Kafter compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could haveguaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, andstill have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.-Bennettbet@sbi.com

Does theother party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to undo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for another?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someoneelse could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only usewould be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seemslike a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience withcryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation asto how it would be used (remember that I have had little experience withthis sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated. Justin Yorkjyork@iastate.edu

It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that theFBI would do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies.  It wasn'tclear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not, orwhether the FBI would just decrypt the session keys for the locals, or woulddo the whole message.    One thing I'm a bit puzzled by:  Why aren't they doing this with a publickey scheme of some sort?  You could generate two uniqe public/private pairsorfor each chip.  Then, escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies.  Setthe protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys.  To decrypta message, both escrow agencies (in the right order, for most PK schemes)have to decrypt with the escrowed private key.  This way, there wouldn't bethecconcern that, once the police had asked fo  a warrant/wiretap, theywould have your key forver.    --John Kelsey

I've seen a number of   designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the samekey, it can be done.

In answering this>question, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both>strong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap>*some* domestic users, is necessary.I'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument.  In myview the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm issecret, leading to suspicion that there is a back door.  Without completedisclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trustedexperts are allowed to look at it in isolation.Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The onlyconcern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could buildClipperphones without registering the keys.  Assume F can really be keptsecret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection,a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstratethat they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Qand sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiatorsends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just arandom 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q soit can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequentialnumbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initialnumbers of subsequent challenges.  This way Clipperphones will talk onlyto other Clipperphones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their ownproprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies thatthey won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.What's wrong with this picture?  It depends of F staying secret and onSkipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis, but the Government appears tobelieve in both of these.  Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has someflaw, I imagine there's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't.smb says:>The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good>idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.Agreed.

Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decryptrecordings of the conversation.To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, youhave to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone doesthis by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally overthe phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awarenessplus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'voices.A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'dnever use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret keywould only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would stillnot be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which thesession keys have been destroyed.I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones(the STU-III) must work.

CELP takes up about 12.6 MIPS for full duplex, and has beenimplemented on about a million DSP chips... the 56001 card in my PC only costabout $700, and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop. The AnalogDevices 21020 board that we're looking at now cost about $500 (academic price).I don't think hardware is something to worry about... if you get it working,people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow.What we need here is a good implementation of CELP (the government code isabsolute crap, I got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours),and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit framesevery 30msec... I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS).As part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up andrunning in realtime full duplex mode...

As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you canfigure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods.(The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products thatsell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sellthousands of units/year will be at the high end.  I suspect cellular phonesare in the middle).  This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase thecost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.I don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.-tony>>usual disclaimer<<

The general setup is designed so that when users connect they send a private key encrypted using the system publickey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap theone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  Theresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key itis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on themachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealedsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personalprivate keys during the authentication sequence.Questions:Does the fact that the system private key does not provide anyinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far asbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I amassisting in "entrapment" (the users would send thier key anywayand are not being enticed into doing something they would nototherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...jim-- Jim McCoy                |  UT Unix Sysadmin Tiger Teammccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  #include <disclaimer.h>j-mccoy@nwu.edu          |  pgp key available via finger or upon request

By such a back-door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for  the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U) pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ... Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each, plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular, Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting, divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the private sector anyway.

If it isn't at one of   the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any   security you thought you might have had. Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days aremilitary (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel),so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal -it's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and thesecure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doorsbecause they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.)That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in ouroffices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plansand stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical infoand the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob;most people don't use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in theirPBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distanceor value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges).If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones,the conferencing aspects don't change.

What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registeredkeys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. That leads me to conjecture that:1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keysthat work for all the phones in the country.

While I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine.He found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from thelocal engineering library (Madison Wisconsin).  So the lawyers sent himall over the states to other libraries to show that the information inthe article was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a localunderground paper went and published the article anyway (it had beenprecensored by the feds, that's what this was all about) so the judgedeclared the case moot.The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court.  From mydiscussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 othertimes has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the peoplesimply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.For all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence fordeclaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I wasworking on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the worksand I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enoughto classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend fromCanada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute strippingcross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowedto present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in anopen journal without problems.When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whateverthey want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to letthemselves get away with it.  Since the mass media can't tell the differencebetween a joke and the real thing (like "ranch appocolypse" for the Wacomassacre) don't count on them to help spread the word about their lossof freedom.  The government *can* make strong crypto illegal.

The algorithm must be publicly known, and must have a record of       surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses.  2. The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the       advertised algorithm is, in fact, the one that is being used.  3. The key must be quickly changeable by the user, and must be of a       sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search       possible now or in the reasonably near future.  Note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of keyescrow system; the May 1993 issue of "Byte" describes an example of anencryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistentwith the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key beescrowed in order to have one's public key listed by a central distributor.

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differentialanalysis).Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chipand its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:    1) Transmit Channel    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number    unrecoverable with just the family key2) Receive Channel    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -    checksums, sequence control, etc.).This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere isa known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bitsas used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement blockcan be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposedFederal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bitsof N in E[N; F].The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but themutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate theentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption schemesuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement blockcan be recovered are lessened.What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and theserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmissionbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocoltransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the blockcontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the lawenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original statefor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained withinthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before acceptingand decrypting E(M; K);The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, includingon the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products couldbe subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used withoutredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serialnumber.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which shouldnot be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs forprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nicefrom a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated witha particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolenclipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and orspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encryptedstream.Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementionedscheme.******************************************************************************If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and usethem in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a validlaw enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matchingthe remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yetdeliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcementblock.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would requireescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge ofclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidatedby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M streamand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure keygenerator synchronized between endpoints.The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limitedbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmissioninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there'ssupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps tothe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wantsan encryption chip with a real time clock?*****************************************************************************The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.

I think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need toalter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of severalblocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  I don't think it'sat all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on*any* amount of tape or CD-ROM.  And certainly not 2**128 such encryptedblocks.  (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solarsystem into a one bit storage device?)    Actually, a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than thesimpler kind in terms of speed.  It's just that you have to do it overfor *every* encrypted message.    Dumb question:  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how manylegitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part ofan english sentence?  For attacking DES in ECB mode, it seems like adictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....    --John Kelsey

Being a PhD-student at DavidChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in researchin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can beretrieved fromftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.====================================================================ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cashsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of whichlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is thefirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using therepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques areintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal andpayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earliersystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient inboth computation and communication complexity than any such systemproposed previously.  Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can bemathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if wemake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, theability to break the system seems to imply that one can break theDiffie-Hellman problem.   Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve inpreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of theseis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can beincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which hasthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in thefirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spenderafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under themost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank havenegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) bya simple mechanism from within the system, which is something thatprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash systemcan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, whileretaining its computational efficiency.====================================================================Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained aspossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail tome and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are alsowelcome!Stefan Brands, --------------------------------------------------------CWI, Kruislaan 413, 1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 5924103, e-mail: brands@cwi.nl

I gather that from thisproposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collectconversations! Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptivelyall encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (andnot necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelatedincident that can trigger a warrant:   "Your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted crime figure Bugsy Butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in asensitive govt post, is corrupt."  I suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involvedsomewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if there are, why wouldn't thetechnical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the numberof bits held by each escrow authority?

Biham and Shamir showedthat differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round Khafre with a chosen-plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions.  Khafre with 24 roundscan be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions.(There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, ifsomeone wants to take the time to look.)Khufu has key-dependent S-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.Source code for this algorithm (and Khafre) are in the patent.Snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function.  The version of Snefruthat produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis(vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) forfour passes or less.  Given that, SHA and MD5 are much more efficient.Oh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre,Director of Patent Licencing for Xerox, (203) 986-3231.Bruce

We can pick up laptop screens without anyproblem.Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The descriptionturns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one.We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugelyexpensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded tostop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works,and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero.In the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation'(and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which justclaims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is thepretty blue sticker on the box).Ross

One day, the Japanese started showing up withdiscount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture theproducts.This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computersystems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data outdouble-block-encrypted with DES. Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president ofthe company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to"knock it off".

Further, since encryp-tion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of thegovernment's cease-and-desist demand?The spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessingsof the law. I'll say "no thanks" to Clipper, or anything else the governmentproduces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate.

They do what they do now--figure out which lines to tap. They thenrecord the stuff.

If thecrooks were going to use a pay phone (say), they could have done so withoutclipper. If the government figures out they're so doing, they listen in, andif it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys.If the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped linethere's no problem. The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used, justthat the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line.

Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version)was unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using receiveda request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now there is almost no waythat some automatic scanner could have found this, since they wouldn't haveknown about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in themessage, tried to unscramble it, found they couldn't get past the PEMarmour part, and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop.  Luckilythe current email carriers are less picky about what goes over theirnetworks :-).In case people think email scanning doesn't take place, I can assure youthat it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by governmentagencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who,for reasons of their own, have decided to monitor all communications(I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).

If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, italmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuseIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL beexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and storeddata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or suchexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, pleasebear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to saywhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.>Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The>telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule>today.As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this orsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptionssuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on howthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treatthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to otherareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, ifthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used inseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is notgoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedropwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a ratherflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze thematerial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever onperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justicesystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is notprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that wouldresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictionson private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - itdoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especiallyfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up theright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clintonand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How comethose consulted could be roughly described as "us insiders"?  They cannotquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure itsexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honestand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'or 'difficult'.>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the>judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext>without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain>cellular calls and then ask a judge, "Hey, can we have permission to>listen to those tapes?" can they?So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (savedafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  Thishas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  Forlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Fedshave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believefor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listenin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime orvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to useold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdroppingwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the LawEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changesthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  Ijust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so muchabout civil and individual rights, that "puts people first".  The questionis "put people first" to WHERE?With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'Texist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keywordscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specificcourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people thatthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is tokeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? Afterawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folksthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that wouldreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  RememberNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys toa competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expandedto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would getone the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an importantconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...>>worse, of course, if the government then uses this "Clinton Clipper">>to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption.

Youcan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect theargumet "well, if you got nothing to hide..."  Fine. Then using thatargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed inevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea butthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from agovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future asto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards arepretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establishbad precidents, please.

Perhaps acertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selectedexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person wasadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what theexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the ClipperChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippledversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in theversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And whochooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...:-)And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOThave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everythingyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to thisgroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would notbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real securebut "good enough" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a fulldescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what "good enough" means?I think when saying how strong it is, "good enough" really means "notvery".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is notacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights andConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those othercountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have asrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights andprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTAhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill ofRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakiningfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repairthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but "toomany rights and safeguards" is not a signifigant one.  A broken courtsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having"too many rights" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,etc).BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believethis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposedthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rightsunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decadeshave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of theConstitution.  It has to stop.

We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam'sBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin'sslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those onhis "enemies list."  Or, we recognize that for the price  ofa  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed ofsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  bya  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-longings if it beeps.     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  therewere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners withclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers foreavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, theevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms fromthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favorsthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  themerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-scribe government bureaucracy than "dull" and "sluggish"?     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technologyover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portablecrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliablyand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  ifthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlikethe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  couldget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required noformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  requiredelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination toachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbowcould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along thearrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-get.)     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knightslikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be governmentsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  wasplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselvesnot only against one another, but against their governmentalmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (themedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  andCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-tively, for its unlawful possession.     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technologylike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and thehandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advancedmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonaland inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45called "the equalizer."  A frail dance-hall hostess with onein  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herselfagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of therepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  "a  man  onhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot becaptured."  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  uponflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless atrue one.     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  cansuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one'sown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-change   information   over   an   insecure   communicationschannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   orskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previouslymet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAYX-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it shouldbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  itwill  have  totally demolished government's control over in-formation transfer.     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm iscalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adlemanwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the factthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  verylarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain thetwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    "Ex-tremely"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerfulcomputer now in existence.     The  "public" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *(q-1) + 1}.  The "private" part of the key consists  of  theother factor  y.     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turnedinto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simpleA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integeris then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resultinginteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiverdecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will alwaysyield the original number started with.     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  whyit  is  called  "public-key"  cryptography,"  is  that I canopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  whilekeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send mean encrypted message, namely                       x                     a    (mod pq)  ,but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  takingwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking theresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipherkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trusteach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected anddisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintainingthe secrecy of his own  y.     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a "dig-ital signature," to enable one to authenticate the source ofa given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (modyour pq)  and send that.    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a andraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod mypq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  andsend this, then even after you have normally "decrypted" themessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if youthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but Icould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secrety).     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  ofpersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize thatAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, infact, because there are things computers can do  which  willinterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-cisely these students who one generation hence will be goinghead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  theSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing toteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learningballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personalcomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copyingmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  oftext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If thisweren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  thecopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all butunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively fewcopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-sively than machine guns are in the United States.)     Now  the  "conservative" position is that we should notsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  usethem  in weapons systems.  The "liberal" position is that weshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  andcooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, therewill certainly be some other nation willing to.     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarianposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, andif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn'twork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  overMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that thisis not a position that has gained much support among membersof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, weare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  aparticular  goal may not look anything like what most peoplewould consider a "straight line."    Taking  a  long  enoughworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  tothe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution ofthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozenmissiles aimed at Moscow.     But  there's  the rub:  A "long enough" world view doessuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  thesimply  stupid  will "get what they deserve," but what's notimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  beingkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed tohamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  politicalgradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  havepatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wireand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  "feed  the  poor"while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and driveup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witnessthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered aspotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few yearsago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economyrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increasewas called the "moral equivalent of war" and the Feds  swunginto  action.    For the first time in American history, thespeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  ofoil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  whosell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to ourgrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  thatgovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC haslowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seekingto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,what  can we call this except the "moral equivalent of civilwar--the government against its own people?"     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  tocourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods toocheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  becompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that itbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple ofhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--wecertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period ofstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  thereexists  almost  a  "black  hole"  effect in the evolution ofnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  statewarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself tothe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomesall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seenin the area of so-called "welfare" payments.  When those whosup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) thosewhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possiblechoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Godown to the nearest "welfare" office, find just  two  peopleon  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they forma voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  questionof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.     So essentially those who love liberty need an "edge" ofsome  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  "other-directedness"  of"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation ofa billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world."Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, itis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a"cause," caring only enough for their personal welfare so asto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continueworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energyto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic orlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonightand say something like, "Listen, follow me as I enunciate mynoble "cause," contribute your money to support the "cause,"give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the "cause," striveselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  yourchildren are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-ally  live under egoism"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  Andof course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  tomake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find itprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  onlythen.     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor evennecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasingfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of theinvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and allforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   themunilaterally.     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed tothe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel withthe saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  oftenenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  Ishall therefore repeat it now:     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed himfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed himfor a lifetime.     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort ofa  "workfare"  vs.  "welfare"  context;  namely, that if yougenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach himhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.And of course this is true, if only because the next time heis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or evenable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on howto fish, he is completely self sufficient.     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first ordercontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  toglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing itagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruistslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungrybeggars as we may encounter.     But consider:     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  hedoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  countrybecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, andthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  supposethe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, barteringfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  firstthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  typecategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premisethat  every  trade  must  have a "winner" and a "loser;" theidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the"expense" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  thisscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sumgame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  "law  ofdiminishing   returns,"   the  "first  and  second  laws  ofthermodynamics"--all those "laws" which constrain our possi-bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that'sanarchy!     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungryEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  hisnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fishcontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, hetells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--andeven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people'shealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willingadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thoughtto be government property, and therefore it is the  functionof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-ously extends to competent adults the "benefits" it providesto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they neednot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behaviorthought physically risky or morally "naughty."  But, in  anycase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  ofhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of "pos-session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute."     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquelyoppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  anaffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwartingthis tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be "altruistic"  inthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or"egoistic" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  theoppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-haps even other motives.)     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  toyour "cause," you're not about to mount a military campaign,or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally ahundredfold.    I say "literally," because for a fraction ofthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  tosmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce ahundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-geted government, like present-day America, at least permitsopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the governmentattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  thenyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps writeyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according toyour mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far asincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuinenonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as othersre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  youhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  "Freedom  in  anUnfree World" that the success of any endeavor is in generalinversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-sion is necessary to its fulfilment.     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it hasbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shapedby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla andWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-vasive, and not nearly so bloody.     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTechProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seizefreedom for ourselves.     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (atpresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when governmentwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armorwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were tocommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then thatfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  butit does indicate how government thinks.     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeedpose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyonewho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the "undergroundrailroad" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--asthe sovereign government of the United States of America  atthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quiteas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  toferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agentsfor his "crime"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  lifewhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of thisdrug.     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . "Let me make one thingperfectly clear:"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--nomatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupidsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technologicalprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a planeor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  isneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-self.     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  anddespair,  thinking,  "Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% ofthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarianbefore  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut mygoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery"--recognizethat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-self free.     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fakename  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on themailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Anyfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interestedare welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise comparedwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If youshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  toplug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.Even if you want to be the proverbial "free rider" and  justbenefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:Everything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  orgive it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you canget  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying togive it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalistprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principlesshould make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainlywilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-ture.     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don'tlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  theyoutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn beforethey outlaw plowshares too.                                       --Chuck Hammill                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT                                 3194 Queensbury Drive                               Los Angeles, California                                                 90064                                          310-836-4157                                    hammill@netcom.com[The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992, with the permission of Chuck Hammill, by Russell Whitaker]Those interested in the issues raised in this piece should participatein at least these newsgroups:                alt.privacy                alt.security.pgp                comp.org.eff.talk                sci.cryptA copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program, PGP 2.1 (PrettyGood Privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.One such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an MS-DOS version can be had byanonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp.Versions for other operating systems, including UNIX variantsand Macintosh, are also available.

Not onlywill this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let usrun speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us bygetting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if theadministration realised, would probably scare them shitless.Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocolfor internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave toinplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on ourworkstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised,we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used tocatch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data duringsilences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each endbecause any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon asI get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :)(whether encrypted or not)You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious,why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns andit didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.G

Let's assume a brute-force engine like thathypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well,maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and builda machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you?Hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at thatspeed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if thatwere the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing justyet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70'stechnology.  Modern chips can do a lot more.NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA (I doubt it forthe former; I have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be astrong cryptosystem).  But it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search.

It would be nice to know that they werenot a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the U.S. government.  Trusting the fox to guard the chickens, and all that.Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verifiedagainst silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon,regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm.  It would be a shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, whenall I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook theline went dead.  Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connectdirectly to a modem.The design examination should be done to the gate level.  Does anyone havea good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon?  The modelwould be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function.  Tip offswould be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequenceis not right.  I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used,and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist.I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated.  Imagine a designdone in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under themicroscope.  The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm, operating protocols, the agency having physical control of the devices, the silicon implementation.  I'd feel like keeping one hand on my wallet.

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me onThursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerabletime talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and Iattended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  The document below is the result of that effort. Dorothy Denning---------------                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                               Dorothy Denning                                April 19, 1993INTRODUCTIONOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bringtogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary programto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs oflaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryptionchip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach toescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts fromboth are needed to reconstruct a key.CHIP STRUCTUREThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryptionalgorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (comparedwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is16 Mbits a second.Each chip includes the following components:   the Skipjack encryption algorithm   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips   N, a 30-bit serial number   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chipENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIPTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&Ttelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone andwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secureconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K withthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange canbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are thenfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encryptedunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, allencrypted under the family key F.CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROWAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computerinformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF containsa laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chipsare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located atMikotronx.At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two keyescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These valuesserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N isfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a64-bit block R1:        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 andN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:          R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]         R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. Thefirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  Therest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrowagencies.As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they arewritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains afile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key partU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The thirddisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from thevault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additionalassurance that no information is left behind. The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in theroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back tothe escrow agencies.The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will notbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One orboth may be independent from the government.LAW ENFORCEMENT USEWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, theywill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to getaccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is inplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted withClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with thefamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take awarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrowagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to producethe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplishedthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based oninformation provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission todistribute this document is granted.

It's muchstronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was firststandardized, a simple double encryption would not have the samestrength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or lessthe beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything ofvery high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fitthat description.Why n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  Ihave no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they'reconstructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change-- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bitpatterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_ivalues are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hammingdistance.In any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_ifrom the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they don'tneed to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  Intheory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.)The real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposedto a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is*much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, theEFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random numbergenerator, and that it passed every test you could think of.  When youcome back next week to program some more chips, does it still work thatwell?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components beenchanged out from under you?  Does it still work well the in thepresence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towardsselecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on itagain, but that's hard.Consider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your ownfloppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's alot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.(Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too.  I think that they'rea lot harder.)There are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not thearchitecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,with one significant exception, is yes.  I really do think that NSA andNIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming thattheir real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, undercertain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk ofabuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on aprogramming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should beloaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don'tclaim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoningsufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusionssection of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted thescheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged withimplementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights anddue process.  What would you do differently?  In answering thisquestion, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that bothstrong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap*some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary tochallenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue Ipresent below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technicalaspects.  And no, I don't by any means claim that just becausesomething can be done, it should be.)The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actuallygoing to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn'tmean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA willsubstitute its own chips between the programming facility and theshipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so thatthe escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,guys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to havebought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have noanswer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way ofanswering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answerto the final question, below.The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a goodidea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.I think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civillibertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at greatlength on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energyto repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that somelaws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights ofindividuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in oursystem -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power hascertainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly inother cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- butagain, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertariansto answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of therest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for thosewho give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much moredistant from.)--Steve Bellovin

Incidentally, my MP has responded tomy questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries willget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used withA5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on thecapabilities of the base station.The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key tolisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular usersand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellularcalls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to anotherbase-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambledcall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider'sequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they canlisten without having to obtain a warrant.But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrantto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (seeabove - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need awarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stoplistening in'...You have every reason to be scared shitless.

Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad, andexclusive-or as the encryption operation.  If an adversary knows the plaintext of a message, he can change it into any other message.  Here's how it works.Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P, under a key stream SAlice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P,  and sends it to Bob.Eve knows the plainext P, but wants the message to appear as P'.Eve intercepts C, and computes  C' = C xor P xor P' = S xor P'.Eve sends C' to Bob.Bob decrypts C' by computing  C'xor S = P',  thus receiving the false message which was substituted by Eve.Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with informationtheoretic security, not just computational security.Can we define something like "ideal authentication" which is theanalog of ideal security.  Can we obtain ideal authentication ?If not, how much can we limit Eve's control over the message ?If we can achieve ideal authentication, does the solution use morekey bits or expand the message ?  Can we show the solution to beoptimal in one or more parameters ?Does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before ?olson@umbc.edu

H() is not invertible.Algorithms for E(), D() and H() are secret. Otherwise a softwareimplementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip.The chip only supports the following operation:1)  Return N[0]2)  Load K0[x]3)  Return E(K0[x], U0[x])4)  Return E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F)5)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F),return N[1],L1[1],...,L1[A]6)  Load K[1]7)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F),compute KE[0], KD[0]8)  Given M, return E(M, KE[0])9)  Given M, return D(M, KD[0])Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroyingthe chip (U[1],...,U[A],F,N[0]).U[1],...,U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip.(Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it'spossible to determine how a chip has been programmed with asophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.)The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.Notes:For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1],E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y].LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers fromboth chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agenciesto record that both chips were tapped.LEA's only get the session key, not the key to all conversationsof a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of aconversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements.Observation:In order for any secure by "tap-able" communication scheme to work,the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret isrevealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made"un-tap-able". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithmand the master (family) key. Relative size and complexity suggeststhat the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of thescheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm.rsbx-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Raymond S.

The first part of the plan is to begin acomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such asexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access torobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has alreadyreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before anypublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, theAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephoneequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by theNational Security Agency.  The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an 80-bit,split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chipsmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents wouldstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement uponpresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to beclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer forincorporation into its communications products.     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting aninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secureproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source forthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturersshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, theAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFFbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  Thepublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that isopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system mayprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcementneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it isadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's FifthAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a fewof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails toanswer.In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importanceof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacyand security.  However, the "Clipper Chip" solution ought to beconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before thediscussion even begins.DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:ESCROWThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whomhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications devicewould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrowagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents wouldhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According tothe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will beasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administrationhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps theFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORSThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by whichthe government or others could break the code without securing keys fromthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are noback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star cryptocracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine thealgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then bemade public.The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,secret contract between the National Security Agency and two privatefirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway forabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVERIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believesin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customersfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP AlGore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department pressbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would anyprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that hadno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRYThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence aninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  exportcontrols on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital TelephonyProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by theNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the PresidentialDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvementin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)Daniel J.

I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''.The SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multipleencryption systems, as does PEM.  (And I'd love to see how they'dmandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)Mind you, I'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually beused -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, whichcertainly casts doubt on your choice of words.

The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.  NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process." CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Washington, DC.

Can anybody verify>or refute this?You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential sources of leaked information.Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection becomes an important security hazard.In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns, particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release' for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified. Ifyou think about it, it would really have to wouldn't it?    --                                -= Owen Lewis =-                                      @      Tele/fax  +44-(0)794-301731   ELOKA   Consultancy & Project Management                            oml@eloka.demon.co.uk                        pgp 2.x public key on request

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.      -- Jim GilloglyTrewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01

Here is some information "from the horse's mouth".(Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media ("clearing") meant to be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security (NTISS) "Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):------"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic MediaCertain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character.Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this.Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction; however, they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded.7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic MediaCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character, then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) alternatively.When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media"[see DoD Computer Security Center, "Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]------This and many other interesting documents (many that are more informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures can be obtained (free) from:Executive SecretaryNational Telecommunications and Informations  Systems Security CommitteeNational Security AgencyFort George G.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  Theyneed a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, theynow need to    (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of       the key.Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  Stateand lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderatelyclever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buyingnew phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolenones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmittingwithout a dialing license?]There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enoughsafeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-typechip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the FederalGovernment, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic ofthe projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of these kinds of problems will be open for public or "expert" scrutiny?]  Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:    (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and       turns the results over to the NY State Police.But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a ClintonAid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf wargoing on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have anextra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as anotherbargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain.

The algorithm is classified. I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm is a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by the NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years.  Myktotronx refers to it as "Government Type II encryption", which matches the designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones, and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called "CIPHER2".This would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem which can act as a "pin-compatible" substitute for DES.  Combined with a tappable key exchange protocol, this would offer exactly what is claimed for Clipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow.  If this is fact the case, it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.Now, I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent.  However, it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES (and which is at least as secure), set up a key escrow scheme for law enforcement, and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx, who's been around but almost invisible for years.Has anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink elephants here? :).

The original articlehas reappeared, so:    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law    enforcement.Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption onordinary landlines.    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communicationslinks.OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) willbe applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stoppeople listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn'teven be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy'smisfortunes).Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clearwhen the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinaryconversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerableas at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radiolinks.OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phonelines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes itclear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full ofobfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise(IMHO).BTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen anyreplies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?

Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list  dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy  in the digital domain.''  Send email to  cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the  list. From the charter:  > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.  > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt  > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for  > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will  > learn how best to defend it._____<4.4> What are some privacy-related newsgroups?  FAQs?

Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the  /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is  relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).  Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and  modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are  amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites  become operational. Address all points in the section  ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to  advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term  stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously._____<4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more  information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.MISCELLANEOUS=============_____<5.1> What is ``digital cash''?  With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be  realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum  (~Dec.1992).  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:    ::    command: help        user@host  where `user@host' is your email address.   _____<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.  _____<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or  > their opinions.  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks._____<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.   Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following  commands in the subject line:    subscribe    unsubscribe    help_____<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ  for alt.security.      Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First  International Symposium on National Security & National  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,  > but you may differ..._____<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?    RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local  communication socket (a connection of this type is established  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms._____<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?  Remailing/Posting  -----------------    - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET    postings.  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,    encrypted addresses, etc.)  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and    remailer site chaining.    General  -------    - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the    general public and their governments.  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies     by systems designers into    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement    agencies.  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to    strengthening and protecting it.ISSUES======_____<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic  > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like  > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis  > of new forms of community.

EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of  Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead  rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI  raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve  Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector  Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.    In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee  with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated  November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented  Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national  public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in   ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):  > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to  > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create  > a consumer-oriented, public information network.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been  working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues  since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and  caller identification.  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions  here.)_____<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.    (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.   > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of  > jurisdictions.  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science  Fiction Magazine:  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.   > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:    > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.   >   > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer  > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of  > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first  > case to challenge the practice.   >   > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin  > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never  > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal  > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and  > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine  > that the company was a publisher.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes  existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and  intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone  networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and  video transmission applications.  G.

This could be substantiallythe same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, thepolice could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretappedmessages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you couldgenerate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd bewilling to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given thealternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'dprobably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).   This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather informationon suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and therewould be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.(Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correctme, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcementcapabilities.)    Any comments?    --John Kelsey

The government decided to "discourage" them.   You're blowing smoke.  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas   markets like Japan and the EC.  The government told them "don't do encryption   if you ever hope to export this technology".  The reason that CDMA doesn't   have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door.   It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular   is big enough for them.  This is just the International Traffic in Arms   Regulations all over again.Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas, andthe government told them they wouldn't be allowed to export,so he's only blowing the same smoke you are :-)Sure, they probably could have made a US version, and a non-cryptoexport version, and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house todevelop an overseas crypto ROM, but that's getting pretty expensive.   No, Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different   stuff for domestic use vs. export.  Qualcomm isn't.  So Cylink makes   money--that's capitalism, comrade.Well, some people like capitalism, and others prefer free enterprise;they're different!

Law-enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco, or illegally by findingsome part of the phone line that they can cut into.  The degree of riskdepends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street,but not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord's ranch).  Theonly way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a publickey indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (allof them) - totally impractical, even if some part of the Cripple algorithmcould be used as a kind of public key (I don't understand enough about thesethings to know).This sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link,and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems forother phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone.Gosh, yet another way to get round Cripple encryption.

The redundancy hereby introduced can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy replaced the L.E. block by random data. And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting faulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own safety ;-(. The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks than those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the algorithms (and protocols) remain secret.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password  and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli  [BER91].  Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.   There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files  that have a 10 char or less pw key.''* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the  following:   1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.   If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis  texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in  the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]  Here's one popular method, using the des command:    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this  writing.  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ  as well.  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm  without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)  in the USA.  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside  the USA.  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as  we know).* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt  breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].* How do I use compression with encryption?  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's  impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy  has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some  redundancy in your compressed output.  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.    This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means  removes the need for strong encryption.  Compression after encryption is silly.* Is there an unbreakable cipher?  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as  plaintext.  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is  expected to remain valid.* What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps  generated by a hardware random number source).  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random  string.  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be "random".  For  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.   Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security  from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine  the likelihood of events of interest.  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been  intercepted.  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if  it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most  promising directions.  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].* What is key management and why is it important?  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but  also enough key material to cover the traffic.  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and  handling of keys.  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the  reporting of lost CIKs.  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable  structure at all.  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.  The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do  you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of  the language as a whole.  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.  In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood  estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a  text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with  reasonably robust answers.  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.* What is the Enigma?  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by  the British during WWII.''  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].* How do I shuffle cards?  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two  addresses given)  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since  ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the  illegal copy.* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?  schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number  is (801) 224-6970  No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the  subject....  Peleg, S. and Rosenfeld, A.

Is the Clipper chip going to be exported?  If not, how willpeople communicate with other countries?  Will they have to dothat in un-crypt-mode.  Will other encryption techniques belegal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) whengoing overseas, but not within the states?2.  I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic  security card that looks like a calculator to create an encryptedPIN based on the time/date.  The host system has the algorithmbuilt into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.Is there some form of encryption technology that would createkeys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  The systems would then allow a "window" of time around this instantwhere the key would work.I realize that this technique would increase the amount of informationneeding to be stored because you would need entire algorithms ratherthan just keys.  But for smaller scale things it might work.Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys thatare issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week(for instance).  If further surveilance was needed, they would haveto go back to the escrow service to get another key.  This wouldmake it useless for local police to database keys they have used.I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would needto be able to decypher the message.  But any thoughts on the subject?Thanks,Tauren MillsTauren Millstauren@rigel.cs.pdx.edu

Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast   as a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and   develop the state of the art. While there aren't classified patents, there are "patent secrecy orders".Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent.The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copyof your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patentapplication has now been classified for national security reasons andyou're no longer allowed to make and sell it.  I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s.It was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probablyviolated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm andthen file a patent application.  Since it's been published,they can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't getpatents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus"You can't sell that widget, because there's a classified patent on it.You're not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design,so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throwyou in jail for espionage."

Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand.Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, withthe usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: mediain this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, andsuch publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all saypretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range ofcenter-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-skywe-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seemsto be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable ofunderstanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them(as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpretevents in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not goodat understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate informationabout them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to beclarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper hadI not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,let alone Internet access?For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do nothave TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that isthe way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren'tTOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to theproblem.And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without politicalconnections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few ifany rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for theirpolticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as ifthey regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt,peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nastywhen someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend tofall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the currentstate of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzifor daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the lawhe pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a lesswell-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example ofone standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solutionsure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what isgoing on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a positionwhere one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite ofa journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-thancomplimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in themedia.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political viewson the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist.Isn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for theaverage person, to start being what they claim to be, instead of spindoctors for the Statist elements?>-- >Rahul Dhesi <dhesi@rahul.net>>also:  dhesi@cirrus.com-- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!patWISDOM: "Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,         and I am not sure about the former."              - Albert Einstien

Anybody know?I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some otheralgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree ona session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (somethinglike DES) for the encryption.How could the "back door" keys work in this system?  I can see a fewpossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property thatthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back doorkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbersused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chipssimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's owninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keysusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip'ssecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can beidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems moststraightforward to me.)Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for themessage itself has a "dual key" property, that possession of either oftwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key fromthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raisedduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November andDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party wouldparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit intowhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had earlyknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized withClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.Hal Finney

The new cryptography scheme wasannounced today by the White House and the National Institutefor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement thetechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesmanacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed theencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.        According to NIST, the technical specifications and thePresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  Toopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR todayfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requestswith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National SecurityCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryptionplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of theComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order toopen the development of non-military computer security standardsto public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation ofsuch standards.        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA indeveloping the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), acommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed forgovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIAlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the firsttime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifyingthe classification of records concerning its creation of theDSS.        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called theadministration's apparent commitment to the privacy ofelectronic communications, as reflected in today's officialstatement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questionedthe propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparentsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process frompublic scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards thedevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vitalthat standards designed to protect personal privacy beestablished openly and with full public participation.  It isnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition ofsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- toplay a leading role in the development process."        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computerindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact oftechnology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. andmaintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,Massachusetts and Washington, DC.

In fact, it shouldn'teven be possible to detect that a message has been double-encrypted withouta court order, right?

It's pretty simple:Say E is encryption (and D decryption) with key K on 64-bit blocks.Let c[0] be the initialisation vector,m[1], m[2], ... the message blocks,c[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks.Then encryption in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode works by the formula   c[i] = E(m[i] XOR c[i-1]),and decryption by   m[i] = c[i-1] XOR D(c[i]).So if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message  block m[1]. But she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...The situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but  similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)Finally there is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or  whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by   s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],and encryption is given by   c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i].Here the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers  reduces the cracking to key search for K.--Klaus PommereningInstitut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentationder Johannes-Gutenberg-UniversitaetObere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, W-6500 Mainz, Germany

Now, in the days when people had lived inmud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech woodtechnology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone inRuritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, untilthis point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy onsomeone's home, but the new technology made this tempting. This beinga civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binocularsand watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was goingon. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, buteveryone pretended that this didn't happen.One day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Thingswould go back to the way they were in the old age -- completelyprivate.Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes havevideo cameras installed in every nook and cranny. "After all", theysaid, "with this new development crime could run rampant. Installingvideo cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --they are just keeping the old one."A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make thelives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through themud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and thatRuritania was a civilized country where not everything that wasexpedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, ithad been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way tosolve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of itsexpedience. Indeed, "why have warrants at all", he asked, "if we areinterested only in expedience?"A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. Shenoted that people might take photographs of children masturbatingshould the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,and the law was passed.Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouthswhile speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from readingtheir lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, thepolice said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting theirlawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had neverbefore been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but DorothyQuisling pointed out that people might use this new invention ofcovering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping andmutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accusedof being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no onewanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so acompromise was reached whereby all homes were installed withmicrophones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise manlamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the oldlip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones wereinstalled everwhere.However, it was discovered that this was insufficient to preventcitizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some ofthem would cleverly speak in languages that the police could notunderstand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak atall times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require thatthey speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. "After all",Dorothy Quisling pointed out, "they might be using the opportunity tospeak in private to mask terrorist activities!"  Terrorism struckterror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance ofthis new law.Meanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how allof this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of whichall Ruritanians were proud. "Why", he asked, "are we obligated tosacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the policeeasier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent incrime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!"However, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the lawrequired, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near amicrophone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrivedand took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torturewas, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had beenrecently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscenethoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of themajor problems of the new age of plenty and joy.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

Now, this device is not acryptographic device. It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whateveryou want to call it. It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applicationsfor:a) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples)b) speech recording for electronic messagingc) building voicemail systemsd) internet talk radioe) internet relay chatOf course, some of the electronic messaging in item b might beencrypted, possibly realtime, but that's the user's decision. One wouldneed 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutoutto switch over, and some code on, say, a 486 laptop.I'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactiveinternet talk radio could be done. Ideally, though, it should be a generalpurpose device. It should be a general purpose enough device that nobodyshould be able to balk at its widespread use. Obviously, to make it easyfor homebrewers, it should use pretty common hardware.It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a coupleof folks about building such a thing, before this whole clipper thingstarted. I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who areable to make sample units, given incentive and some time. I'd envisionedfinding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping funddevelopment of a public domain board layout and parts set, that couldbe published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CADpackages, and in PostScript.Anyone interested? I'll start a provisional mailing list. Letme know if you want on.mjr.

And, theproposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to whatexists now.    The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have toconcern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSAhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, theexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds ofpossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)a DES keysearch machine.    As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combinationcould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, sinceit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crookedjodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agencyor organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are usedto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who wouldtrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all thecomplaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollarsto build a keysearch machine for.)    How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages ofthe GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?

Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likelyas secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistantto "practical cryptanalysis."  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes howseveral NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despitesecurity measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  AndNSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands ofpolice organizations and courts across the land.    --John Kelsey, c445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu

The Clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstrationreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technologyto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on anyserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyonewith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that theyare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of thepublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.>While encryption>technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the>unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used>by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant tothe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billionsof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hopeMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he shouldfind merit with it nevertheless.)Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, andguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.>For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our>private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the>tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of>protecting Americans.For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting Americans.>Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important>role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act>quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding>its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that>protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting>them from those who break the law.It is not possible for the Federal Governmentto ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensivepolicies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle sucha thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way todeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.The administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications.Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit theirsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it. >Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological>     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be>     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more>     powerful encryption devices?No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalentto a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I willtrade threats for threats, and violation for violation.>     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption>     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,>     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have>     effectively done);If the administration did say this, it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal andcriminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population.>     nor is the U.S. saying that "every>     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an>     unbreakable commercial encryption product." The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.[privacy vs. law enforcement]>     There is a>     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is>     an "either-or" proposition. This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims ofprivacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise. Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology, to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and *unrepresentative* government.--ld231782@longs.LANCE.ColoState.EDU

Thanks for trying it.The following program is a very quick hack I created a few monthsago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could performreal-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data ratessustainable by today's modems.This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device,compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samplesrecorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encryptsit with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audioback to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio streamis 13 kbits/s (!).My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days,certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  Iran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember,though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance cancertainly be improved.The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de,I believe (look for gsm or toast).

Apologies to those who were confused.The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yetanother rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that Idisagree both with the interpretation of "well-regulated" in the SecondAmendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion ofthe same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and myreading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control,and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter aspecial interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous referencein which "well regulated" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', andnot under control/disciplined, etc.Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and notan 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know manydo) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particularforum.To avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that I've come in hereto post this one message, just to clarify the one below.
