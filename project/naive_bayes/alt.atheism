Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed  some unusual  dataafter working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   "ThePopehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur.", reveals Gillow in hisgroundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermostworkings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair,first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late1950's."The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn'twant the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was heftingnearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  hisskull.", notes Gillow in his report. "There are whole  laboratories inthe  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrowexperiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400's is nowscientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant ideastarted  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Learytransplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats." Gillow is quickto point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and thedisappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye."When it becomes time to replace the pope", says Gillow, "The old popeand the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  buttheads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  Thevictor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choirboys."P.--  moorcockpratchettdenislearydelasoulu2iainmbanksneworderheathersbatmanpjorourkeclive p a u l  m o l o n e y  Come, let us retract the foreskin of misconceptionjames trinity college dublin  and apply the wire brush of enlightenment - GeoffM brownbladerunnersugarcubeselectronicblaylockpowersspikeleekatebushhamcornpizza

Each time a member of the one familykills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justifiedin killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that thissequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don'tlike dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the familygoes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, thereis a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.How do you resolve this?Well, they are all murders.Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your "problem," butit still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.And, in any case, the nested "murderer" in the definition of murdercannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, thefirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarilya murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparentlyunreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all theinformation is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.keith

Can you see that?I don't deny this fact.The thrust of my argument here is that (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been foundguilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it iswrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhapshave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important distinction.I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say "Muslim".  Ingeneral, anyone who calls themselves a "Muslim" and does not do or outwardly professsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islamis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary toIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become aMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essentialprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.The term "Muslim" is to be contrasted with "Mu'min", which means "truebeliever".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min issomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So youwill not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,for example, am a "true believer" or not.  For example, I could just beputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite towhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say "Muslims"we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether inpractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By"Muslim" we do not necessarily mean "Mu'min", or "true believer" inIslam. Fred Rice darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but  also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability  to commit the same crimes again.

An atheist is one for whom all things canbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no needfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There isno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required byphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing isdetermnined.This would also have to include human intelligence of course and allits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that itacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, noevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or lessvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-an event can have value. The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,from teaching, training, observation and experience and are onlysignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mentalprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electricalactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The humanmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down ahill.How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizingthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? Onwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? Itseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, youhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but whatin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke toestablish your values.Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, whatdifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious orotherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The onlyway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that theobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimerthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carriesno weight in any "absolute" sense.That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about Godor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in yournervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupledwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That yourobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've beenconditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of yourintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism andto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any humanthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excludedyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have noweight whatsoever.Bill

How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know?Or are you speculating that its all speculative?

None of this is intended as a flame. To say thatyou don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot.

In other words, wheredo you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean thatall of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationismis a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especiallyspeculative, in which case I have merely misinterpretedyou.

It hasn't be proved, nor has it beendisproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many peopleare interested in it! I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely theexistence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilitiesare supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances canbe inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstancescan be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon thatcould be described as God is considered part of the natural world, tobe studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).  For example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``Iam God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,''and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist)would say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as wethought we did, and that loud voice is something new.

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential orunrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Betweenthe last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen ormore posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.  It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questionswill just go away, and he is doing his level best to change thesubject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, Iwould like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers,in the following manner:1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address theChallenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that herefuses to do so.--or--2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within itsomething similar to the following:    "Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges."Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want somehonest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much toask from a devout Christian, would you?  Nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.--Dave Wood

The claims that Jesus have been seen are discreditedas extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, itis for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has beenseen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one wouldhardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence ofa resurrection. There have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they havenot passed your post filtering.  >I thus interpret the "extraordinary claims" claim as a statement that the>speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter.

He is defending Islam.  When defendingIslam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticizeyou.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm".

We are talking about origins, not merely science.   Science cannot    explain origins.  For a person to exclude anything but science from    the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth    than science.  This is a false premise.  By the way, I enjoy science.

This is logically bankrupt -->where is the proof of this nonexistence?  It's a joke. This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the  belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist. This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The  reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.>Fine, but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of>a God?

There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a   particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).  >Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable.  Yet>they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God>is unknowable.  This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is,>though it's less arrogant and pompous. Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:  Strong atheism - "I believe god does not exist"   a positive belief Weak atheism   - "I don't believe in a god"       a negative belief  these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)  suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:  christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god  atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)  atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set  agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....) >Why are people so afraid to say "undecided"?

In fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated.

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argumentagainst extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has sometruth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a_plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At thisstage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven oranything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince youall of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lotof work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order togather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.  Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is "a prime cause"(in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychologicalproblems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not sayingit is "the prime cause" or "the only cause", just "a prime cause" --i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think whenyou say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- Iadmit that there are probably other factors, but I do think thatextra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family)is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems likedepression in Western society this century.

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing  innocents, is unconscionable.  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with  no net positive gain.  Why?  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond  that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life  at all.

But where did that choice comefrom?We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by atempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,invent, create, call the action what you will, something that Godhad not given origin to?Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes meas being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, likesalvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightlycoupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?

Need I say more?There is also the question of what is meant by "atheist".  A familiarexample of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows.The two statements following ARE consistent:(1) I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks(2) I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socksThe two statements following are NOT consistent:(3) I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks(4) I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socksStatements (1) and (2) require no faith, they make no presumptions aboutthe nature of reality.  Statements (3) and (4) require belief.  Manyatheists (myself included) take the following position:(5) I do not believe that there is a god.(6) I do not believe that there is not a god.That is , I harbor no beliefs at all, there is no good evidencefor god existing or not.  Some folks call this agnosticism.  It does notsuffer from "blind faith" at all.  I think of it as "Don't worry, be happy".

I think depression is more likely to comefrom emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) andpromiscuity is used as an escape.Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than anemotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion aswhat is expected from a married couple.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, inmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for ourenvironment. Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles andinitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According toCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission andObjectives:                            MISSION    It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members   to foster and implement the improved education of young   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in   which we must all live.                          OBJECTIVES    In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary   objectives shall be:       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many            environmentally concerned organizations as            possible, said Movement having as its primary            focus the education and participatory            involvement of young people in appropriate areas            of environmental concern;       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and            their branches a full complement of program            materials for their use, including suitable            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and            other items as shall seem appropriate and            desirable;       (3)  To serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange            of program ideas, materials and information            among said organizations;  and       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned            organizations to recruit and train the necessary            adult leadership for their youth programs. EnviroLeague will operate through three "Program Divisions" serving youth inthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall bethrough formation of "EnviroLeague Teams," either by EnviroLeague itself or byenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing acharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague. EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leadersof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles tomembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improperconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certainadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should suchorganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon aspossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as toyouth membership. EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much tocontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of itsTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing anylocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may beinvolved in similar functions at the national level. Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the "draft"portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in theEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takesplace. CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose thiselectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTHForums. The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GOEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named "EnviroLeague."============================================================================ Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its firstmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:       EnviroLeague       P.O.

And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide theworld into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, andhave nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernaturalbeing is your criterion.But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept-ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are - I assume - worried about.And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical,critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable andeasily led on the other.I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicatesthat a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to bebeside the point.jon.

Ah, now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario. We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicatewith humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from yourown words) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck,makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.) Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced arevelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seemto contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of theobserved world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there aremany mutually contradictory claims of revelation. Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absenta personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainlynothing to this 'revelation' thing?>I'm not an objectivist, so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of>conceptualization.

Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of theclaims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing? Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. Ihave come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it isnothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with. Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be heldaccountable for such an honest mistake? Sincerely, Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu "The meek can *have* the Earth.

The request for solemnly swearing, so help you god, is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left handand hold up your right hand.  In the courts of NC, at least, it is alwaysan old and new testament.Though it is hard to imagine, picking up the bible and swearing to (whatever)god is sometimes the least of the religious influence.  There is a court inGreensboro, NC, where the judge routinely has everyone in the courtroomstand to join him in prayer at the beginning of every session.

Is there an independent source for this assertion,or is it all from the Christian Bible?  Is there any record atall of anything he built?  A table, a house, some stairs (NormAbrams says the real test of a carpenter's skill is buildingstairs with hand tools).  Did he leave any plans behind for, saykitchen counters and cabinets?  Did he build his own cross?If so, did he use pressure-treated lumber?  Gotta use thatpressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but itholds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.  I keepseeing these bumper-stickers that say "My boss is a JewishCarpenter," but they're always on the back of Ford Escorts,and a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive apickup, so I'm out for verification that he really was acarpenter.Dean KaflowitzSometimes I like to get away from the shackCatfish ain't prettyBut they don't talk backGoin' fishin' againGoin' fishin' againMe and my no good friendsSure goin' fishin' again

Generally, the discussion comes down to thecontention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel againstIslam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probablysome sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularlyas a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write andpublish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find itoffensive, without fear of persecution or death.  I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in aninteresting position, because I think this is a fine book, onlyincidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I'm damned if I canfind anything malevolently offensive in it.Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslimposters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the bookand had called it such things as "filth and lies", "I would rankRushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse", and so on.Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attemptsto follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is sooffensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, orinaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me tobelieve that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections andattempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.Anyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular lineof discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership haveread this book?

Noss.  It was a textbook in a classI had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decentbibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.It doesn't "compare" religions directly but describes each one individuallyand notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be evenremotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianitymercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book isdivided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religionsfrom the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill eachother over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out alongthe way.  If you like the old stuff, then a couple of books called "The Ancient NearEast" by James B. Pritchard are pretty cool.  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh,Code of Hammurabi, all the stuff from way back when men were gods and godswere men.  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their ownreligion and make it sound real good.

Please also note that though I did initially referto Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim -- rejected by you since -- of personal infallibility, I withdraw this as a basisfor such a statement. I conditionally retain this reference in regardto Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the so-called "Twelve Imams," which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and examplehigher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that theProphet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given yourabstruse theological statment regarding the "natures"  of the TwelveImams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad, something which verges on the sin of association.>As salam a-laikumAlaikum Wassalam,Gregg

My basisis, surprise surprise, on both the Bible and on inherent moral abhorrences, forlack of a better way to put it, to certain things.  Yes, that's vague, and theonly way I know off the top of my head to defend it is to say that all humans are similarly made. Yes, that falls into the trap of creation, and why follow the Bible.  My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust, goodness, love, respect, courage, and honesty in any society rather than deceipt, hatred,disrespect, "cowardness", and dishonesty.  No, I haven't been everywhere and seen everyone, but, according to my thesis, I don't have to, since I hold thatwe were all created similarly.

Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wantedwrite about.      How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If youwant to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? Seriously,the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict eachother. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the nextit says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow adeity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one theyinvented.      For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not toEVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't godsay not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you thinkthat if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand thatit is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of thepoorer quality ones to boot. The only reason xtianity escaped the middle eastis because a certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead made all of romextian after a bad dream.

No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to getto a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful.The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a majordefining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, andis the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes meas most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on thenet.An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of "social norms" inaction is the "micro" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some verygood introductory essays ("Deference and Demeanor" is a classic), aswell as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult andtheoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But evenat his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavilyjargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims inthe setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectationsof them.  This becomes "systematized" in a "socially mandated" way simplybecause otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonalrealtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter-actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego-tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.We simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is oneof the main exemplars.)--Michael L.

If a manifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits upon itself?..Some stuff I can't recall.Then some other questions I think I recall correctly:Can God unmake itself?Can God make itself (assuming it doesn't yet exist)?Has God has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all ofGods potential quantum states into reality?Was God nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed duringthe earliest stages of universal (inflationary?) creation?Is God a vacuum fluctuation?Given a great enough energy density could we re-create God?Would that make US God and God something else?..Some more stuff I don't recall concerning creating God.  Followed by:Is God self-aware?Is it necessary that God be self-aware?Is God a living entity?Is it necessay that God be a living entity?Is God unchanging or does it evolve?..Any comments?

Bruce hits the main point simply -- as Russell Turpin does in more detailin his response.  *All* sources are, in modern historiography, to be usedcritically, which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them aresubject to *specific* examination in the light of motives and other HUMANconsiderations (as well as the physical background).  The critical methodapplies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others(most emphatically *including* the historical researchers themselves.)>wouldn't they be a better "reporter" than someone who heard about it second >hand?  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.  I know, there is bias,>and winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best>still apply?But given the critical principle, what evidence is there that we haveANYTHING at ALL from "firsthand" sources about Jesus?  Paul's letters areindeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions.  They are, asa result, the most historically solid books in the NT.  Paul's claims anddescriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be "wie es eigent-lich gewesen" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant!In other words, we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we wouldthe testimony of a witness in court.The gospels are another story altogether.  Luke is most assuredly NOT afirsthand witness.  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closerto the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient booksand Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in hisbook(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke.  Johnhas a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloveddisciple (who is NOT named.)  We are not bound to accept this claim (fora long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, itmakes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  Neither Marknor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  Later (much later) Christiantradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaicproto-gospel, and associates Mark with Peter as having something like thesame second-hand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel.Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate theactual data before us.  Luke and Matthew both appear to use (differently!)an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words anddeeds) of Jesus, as well as to be dependent on Mark.  This makes theirtestimony AT LEAST thirdhand.All that said, historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from theNT sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources foranything about the earliest Church.  They are also *extremely* importantfor the light they cast (however refracted through Christian biases) onthe sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of thedestruction of the 2nd Temple.The problem of "the historical Jesus" is tricky, however.  There is acycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major "high" in peoplethinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some-thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT.  The difficulty here(which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favorin another generation :-)) was pointed out by Bultmann, after Schweitzer'streatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simplyBECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quiteanonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church, we have no easy and reliableway to distribute ANY part of the material between "real" history and theinventions of the Church.  There are few "radical skeptics" who think wehave nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can bemaintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish "shaping"of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to "invention."--Michael L.

If they aren't Atheists,>what are they?When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving,communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is ofteninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have adin you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a socialcode. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to representthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the otherMushriq, or roughly polytheists. There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or "Progress is the natural consequence of Human activity" or "parlamentariandemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government", however they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic pointof view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. "We are a atheist society" in fact means "we reject the din other thanours". Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case thatis a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about suchdeviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point oflooking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level. I think it took more than one minute.Kutluk

If the issue is, "What are the consequences>if such and such -is- True", then Truth is irrelevent. Which is it to>be?I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require different levels of evidence.As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans. One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the individual always wear business suits, etc.The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are.If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart. Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, thenwe can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, they are irrelevent when theorizing about the "Truth" of the law.Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find"The Truth"?By the way, what is "Truth"? Please define before inserting it in the conversation. Please explain what "Truth" or "TRUTH" is. I do think that anything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a "Truth", we could never possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.--       "Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagreeswith a set of morals YOU have to give. Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testingyour theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him armsto fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down thosewho did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal.Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, "Well, we soldhim all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too badfor Kuwait."  No, unfortunately, sitting back and "letting things be"is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein'smilitary potential as we did was the right move.

For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away.Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing.  --Ron House.

Where do they come #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from#whatever is societally mandated.It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarilyvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with whatis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a littleover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a differentthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eatingmeat may be perfectly legal.##>#Merely a question for the basis of morality#>##>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.#>##>#1)Who is society##>Depends on the society.##Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?No.  Often the answer is "we are".  But if society is those who makethe rules, that's a different question.  If society is who shouldmake the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some thingsabout the US system, at least in principle.##>#2)How do "they" define what is acceptable?##>Depends.#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).Well, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.##>#3)How do we keep from a "whatever is legal is what is "moral" "position?##>By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions#>are none of society's business,##So how can we put people in jail?

The hard trick is to recognise whenit is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.# and only interfering when it's truly#>necessary.##Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of variouskinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort ofliar's paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   One possible justificationis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object iftheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise ifwe don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.##  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.##They see the need for a "justice" system.  How can we even define that term?Only by consensus, I guess.#  Thus you#>get a situation where "The law often allows what honour forbids", which I've#>come to believe is as it should be.  ##I admit I don't understand that statement.What I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such mayalso be seen as immoral.

And it is not given that the quote above is given a high>priority in all interpretations.One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approachto the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like itthat women and men are spiritual equals.I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women havesouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to beforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in theafter-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, thepart saying "For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward"says they have souls.  (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priorityin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to giveall verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according toMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to beconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.>Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage>slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to>slavery. It is a non sequitur.Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence andthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand theQuran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitlyanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachingsit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equalsof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and thatsince women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ havesouls (from the above verse).Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather thantry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring thispassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based onignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss theseinterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people canignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can tryto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- butprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.

I take it that you're expressing skepticismat the idea that those ignorant savages could have influencedthe Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  Youcould be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there anyreason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our "founding   fathers," but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the   American psyche.   ...      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at   Albany Congress: "It would be a strange thing...if six nations   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies."      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs   and congressional delegates in order to "hammer out a plan that he   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy."Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of Californiaat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of theAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.--Doug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.

In the case of the NT, the evidence is strongly in the otherdirection: the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on morethan a low level of significance.

I donot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, andopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do knowthathistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let aloneby the death penalty.My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on thelaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostatelong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is noprecedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantlylevelling death penalties for apostasy.I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of "fasad". Thisruling applies both within and outside the domain of anIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward wasnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.> Stuff deleted> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that> Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

However, the charge of "fasad" can encompass anumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relationsbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed thatthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book fromcirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the"crisis". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was notthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad arelevelled at people, not books.The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before theissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values ofsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of peoplecrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boosthis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. ThenMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed whileprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarilyconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once againattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at thispoint that the fatwa on "fasad" was issued.The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions ofRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization ofthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independantwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwaagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. Thecrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was beingplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.P.S. I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of "shatim" alsoapplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrellaof the "fasad" ruling.

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing howdeviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not bethe true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them.

I would be interested in discussing this privately andI am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept oferror-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent withthe teachings of the Qur'an.

The appearance that there is onecomes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly(physically) in this geometry, rather analogous to the "singularity" atthe North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitudelines.  Such "singular" behavior as the earlier post suggested (infinitetime to reach the horizon) is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choiceof coordinates.  As Paul says, in the object's frame of reference,it WILL hit the horizon in finite time, and then plunge to the singularity(that IS a "real" singularity) in a (short, for "small" holes) further finite amount of time.Not only that, but to an OUTSIDE observer, an object that falls into a blackhole disappears in a finite time also, in spite of the relativistic "slow-down" that intuition suggests.  This is because any light emitted by theobject as it falls (or is shone onto it by a separate "flashlight") consistsof individual, FINITE quanta, and only a finite number of these can reachthe object before it plunges through the horizon.  These will be succesivelymore red-shifted, true, but only a finite number of them will hit the object,and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they,too, are inside the horizon (and thus cannot come out).This reddening, dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast, as the object approaches the horizon, when you do the math.As Paul says, this is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's book "Gravity" where they talk about the appropriatness (sp?) of the term "black hole" and the inappropriatness (sp?) of an older term: "frozen star", which was used earlier in this century before all the implications of black-hole theory were understood.

They claim thatthese keys will be handed to two different companies, and when theyget a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip),they have to get the keys from both companies.

That was what most of those quotes were about, and some includedall atheists, in general, as well.

They are extremely usefulmathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, isvery much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but wehave a very useful model that describes much of the behavior onobjects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was asimple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  That takes a great leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes.

Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be aninterplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day forother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joyand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people werekilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring tomind...I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbersof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originallyintended for.That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it isjust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure inthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning inreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Manypeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their ownstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven tokill by their leaders.The point is that there are many things involved in religion that oftenlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasantside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switchingbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiestparts of Man's history.@Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideologicalsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groupswith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution tofurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that thesewere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religiouspersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them morepowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examplesbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought overreligion that he does not have many choices.Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom oflittle silver butter-dishes.-ciao-chris blask

The conservation ofenergy requires that the black hole lose mass, albeit very slowly, thatthat if primordial black holes were formed, the ones about the size ofsmall asteriods should be evaporating about now in the history of ouruniverse.

I am _not_ asking you to takewhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to getthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for_yourself_.>The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES,>when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex.>I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines, I wrote an>incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not>want his concubine to get pregnant etc., which is contrary>to the notion that "sex is for procreation only".

I just reposted avery good one, under the title "Islam and Women", reposted fromsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of thisexcellent article.  IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is basedcompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses andhadiths to support its point of view.Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historicalstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'anand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and performa particular action, does that automatically mean that their action ispart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Ofcourse not.Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this foryou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says "I am aMuslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now meanthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, andonly an idiot would think so.Do you see my point?>It is very natural to think that>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of >the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial >revolution.  Well, rules have changed and the status quo has driven >Muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a "heathen" world. >Muslim countries have failed economically, they were unable to >accumulate any wealth - directly due to the uncomprimising economic>rules in the Quran. In fact, the rise of Islam can easily be modeled>after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home,>but increase your wealth by conquering places.  You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is anideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximisetheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to becapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support afree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)>When this stopped,>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education>level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health>statistics are miserable etc.. One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it isbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you thefallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) thatIslam => lack of education and power.For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For asignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost inthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education iscompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- historyshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must beother reasons for this situation.>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims >for following the Quran. Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extentof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are notknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims arefollowing the Qur'an or not.>Your idea is baseless from historical>facts, it is a poor utopia, The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at onestage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the Qur'an"that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesisthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historicalfact which contradicts your theory. >while my ideas are derived from social>and economic history. You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education isquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your viewsmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all ofthis.>My solution to all Muslims is simple:>CUT THE CRAP, I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too.>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrateignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularlywith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so Ithink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts thatyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and startthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of ourpostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviouslyhave.

If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the: *lex talionis* doctrine of "an eye for an eye" applies.  This is the: Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on: these verses.:    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is: of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the: word "miscarriage" to mean "premature birth"--i.e., the child is born: alive--and "further injury" to mean injury to either the woman or: the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not: (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does: not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Didthe ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I amtruly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it isnot surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes littlereference to nuclear power and contamination.While your interpretation is a reasonable one, I see no reason to rejectthe other out of hand.  The King Jimmy translation says "if there is nofurther mischief."  This does not necessarily imply to the woman.  I knowif my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort, wewould feel that a life was truly taken, not simply a process halted.

If the code was once perfect, andhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favourof this statement, shouldn't we?Perhaps the biggest "imperfection" of the code is that it is fullof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because theyintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount ofevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it islikely that early exons represented early protein domains.Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears thatintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usuallyhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been insertedlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removedby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would haverequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) areconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves atrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, andthese are not found in or near intron sequences. I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology andgenetics before posting "theological arguments" like this. Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely: scientific perspective, just different.Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion. : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that supportyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientificperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhapsmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex mighthave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported bycomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)  : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, althoughit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. : Actually, neither of us "knows" what the atmosphere was like at the: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?I'd replace "created" with "formed", since there is no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, butorganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.This would leave more than billion years for the first cells toevolve.I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the courseon evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence forthis supposed "degeneration"? I can understand Scott's reaction:: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  : : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you: cannot *know* that.I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence againstthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubtit could ever come to right conclusions.: >>Human DNA, being more "complex", tends to accumulate errors adversely: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial: >>diseases/disorders.You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and virusesdo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests ofa general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicatorsfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it to the present. And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim thathuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people haveclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for eitherclaim. : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original: question) -- I say no, it is not.Of course, nothing "evil" is god's fault.  But your explanation doesnot work, it fails miserably. : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.: : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they arejust as inevitable as any product of evolution.: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I: never said that people are "meant" (presumably by God) "to be: punished by getting diseases".  Why I did say is that free moral: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic: universe.I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeedfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answeris not as clear-cut as it seems to be.What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?  : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.Why is there a "why behind"? And your proposition was somethingthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommendthese books.Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidencefor this? If the whole universe can come into existence withoutany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)suggest, why do people still insist on this? : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its: environment.I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.Try reading P.W.

Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired.   Casesin which they err about the true value of what they are selling.Pretty soon you have to start talking about "informed owner""competent owner" "educated owner" and so on, and the conceptgets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible.But the real problem remains that of looking only at end-pointsin a context.    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble is "small" and that the Moon is "big", but that does not mean thatyou have an objective measuring scale.   Only that these two are fairly common opinions *in context*.An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually "tiny" anda micro-biologist may remark that a pebble is "huge".   Similarly,if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his life for his land, rather than killing him and taking it for free, the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal.jon.

All characters and events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...WALTER M. MILLER, JR"A Canticle for Leibowitz"One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their livescopying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper withink and leaving white lines and letters.EDGAR PANGBORN"Davy"Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing...atoms". PHILIP K. DICKPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather thantechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, heremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:"Galactic Pot-Healer"A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to aremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When thedeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright isunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel."A Maze of Death"Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion."VALIS"The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of GnosticChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam ofunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic anddismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters."The Divine Invasion"God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns fromanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must beassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.MARGARET ATWOOD"The Handmaid's Tale"A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriouslyassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to liveunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and theradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punishedretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" arehunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used toat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.VARIOUS AUTHORS"The Bible"This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, itis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss isabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the onetrue version.                             Books -- Non-fictionPETER DE ROSA"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a veryenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums",Droemer-Knaur, 1989)MICHAEL MARTIN"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press, Philadelphia, USA.A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstandingappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentiousarea.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in theexistence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in thenon-existence of god(s)").  Includes great refutations of the mostchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refutingcontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)"The Case Against Christianity", Temple University PressA comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considersthe best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5JAMES TURNER"Without God, Without Creed", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD, USASubtitled "The Origins of Unbelief in America".  Examines the way in whichunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternativeworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering Franceand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New Englanddevelopments.  "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fateof a single idea, the belief that God exists." 316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4GEORGE SELDES (Editor)"The great thoughts", Ballantine Books, New York, USAA "dictionary of quotations" of a different kind, concentrating on statementsand writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophyand world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from manypeople.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which variouspeople expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number ofthe quotations are derived from Cardiff's "What Great Men Think of Religion"and Noyes' "Views of Religion".490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.RICHARD SWINBURNE"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, OxfordThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence ofTheism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revisededition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.J. L. MACKIE"The Miracle of Theism", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements forGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.JAMES A.

Iwas hoping to discuss something with a reasonable, logicalperson, but all you seem to have for your side is a repetitionof the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before.I am deleting the rest of your remarks, unless I spot somethingthat approaches an answer, because they are merely a repetitionof some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thoughtat all.[..]I have to congratulate you, though, Bill.

The following passages are exact quotes from "The Southern Baptist Convention and Freemasonry" by James L. Holly, M.D., Presidentof Mission and Ministry To Men, Inc., 550 N 10th St., Beaumont, TX 77706.       The inside cover of the book states: "Mission & Ministry to Men, Inc. hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of this booklet with two provisions: one, the material is not changed andtwo, the source is identified." I have followed these provisions.        "Freemasonry is one of the allies of the Devil" Page iv.       "The issue here is not moderate or conservative, the issue is Godand the Devil" Page vi."       "It is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public school education in America were Freemasons" Page 29.       "Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His disciples, and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message."Page 30.       "The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity through fraternity, liberty and equality is toleration. This is seen in the writings of the 'great' writers of Freemasonry". Page 31.       "He [Jesus Christ] established the most sectarian of all possible faiths." Page 37.       "For narrowness and sectarianism, there is no equal to the Lord Jesus Christ". Page 40.       "What seems so right in the interest of toleration and its cousins-liberty, equality and fraternity-is actually one of the subtlest lies of the 'father of lies.'" Page 40.       "The Southern Baptist Convention has many churches which were founded in the Lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the Lodge. Each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of repentance and of praying the blood and the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the dedication of the church and/or building."

This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonableanalysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bibleand modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories,and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koranis consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, thatthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of theKoran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,("forty days and forty nights", "pair of every animal", etc.), we allknow this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event isso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as "A big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage".  Yes, no contradictionbut also not much fact.The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but beingconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of thattime, does not seem much of an achievement.The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have haddivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lotof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of themcan be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book bytalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.The above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.-- Leonard               e-mail:  L.Newnham@bradford.ac.uk

Since I know from observation that others disagreewith me about what is good, I believe I can discount popular opinionabout 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion.I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to getpeople to agree on what is good in a really large number of situationsis probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus, actually.>#>#>  I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that "something is>#>#>better than nothing" is a rational and objective valuation.>#>#Nope.

Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than itever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptionsthat are chagning.

But I digress.Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japanwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.

If some back-water country took over some otherback-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don'tcare, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occuredin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have actedbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived toSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasionby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil interests, caused us to take action.> > [ I've moved a paragraph from here to later on ]> [...]>> >> If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would>> have been appeasement.> > Right.

I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  Thatconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn'tmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it asbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences ofan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemednecessary enough to go ahead with it.But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- Idon't!

I don't believe that you can make thesame claim.> > mathewAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany wasbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being "so deplorable".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombingwasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in adecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a bigstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombingin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and somecivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war thanany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their liveswith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The storiesof "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four yearsand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But we are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  What hogwash.  If "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilians died, it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to the Allied bombing.Regards,Jim B.

But then, menkilling women is nothing new. Islamic Fundamentalists just have a"better" excuse (Qu'ran).     from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990    by John Davidson, Canadian Press     MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old    daughter that shocks the most.     "I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what    happened to your parents," wrote Patrick Prevost. "I loved    your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred."     Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his    apartment in northeast Montreal.     They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after    killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.     The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had    gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money    for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked    his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.     She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or    lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.     Five children have also been slain as a result of the same    domestic "battles."     Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their    husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across    Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for    Justice. [rest of article ommited] Then to say that women are somehow "better" or "should" be theone to "stay home" and raise a child is also laughable. Womenhave traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to meit takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH shouldstay home to do so!--- Maximus 2.01wb

With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic culturesin American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture theboundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation mayeventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, somecultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals.Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, isit moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind ofproblem may only be definable by legislation. Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what isacceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to differentenvironmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.  One thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit allcultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally acceptedmores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcableconcept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples uponthis earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).Jeff 'Nonickname' Clark.

Rushdie was writingabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placingthe actor "Gibreel" in the role of the angel whose name he took.Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claimsor implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat likestories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformedprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to theArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozensof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,consider Salman Rushdie's children's book "Haroun and the Sea ofStories" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specificstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.>to ridicule Muhammad's integrity...No.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in thispart of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie'sintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine andsatanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:    " *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.      God knows whose postman I've been."It's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?Or something else?  The answer is not given.To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and therole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing lossof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The veryexistence of a newsgroup named "alt.atheism" raises the samequestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which isthe real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is "filthand lies", and he "asked for what he got", are we next on the fatwalist?

The factof evolution is that the current diversity of life arose throughcommon descent:  this is so supported by the evidence that no one everbothers to try to test it anymore.  Theories of evolution includetheories regarding the mechanism of common descent (natural selectionvs. drift) or the actual "pathways" of evolution, or any number ofother things.  These are constantly being tested, because the actualmechanisms, etc, behind the fact of common descent are still up forquestion.Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  In other words, itcould, theoretically, still be falsified and rejected.

To hear LaVey say it, only idiots and fools believe in Satan>and or Allah. He knew that suckers are born every minute.>>--- Maximus 2.01wbAnton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  Iread his "Satanic Bible" a few years ago for a social studies project,as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called "The Cult of Devil Worshipin America."  The latter included a very interesting interview withthe Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely aninstrument for one to realize the self.  When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanicritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  Idon't consider LaVey's church to be at all "orthodox," nor do I considerits followers "satanists."  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a littletouch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...Isuppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had ahuge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the way.)  I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible asa Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church ofSatan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionaryand The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.-- ---                      __  _______                              ---||| Kevin Marshall       \\ \\/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department |||||| Virginia Tech         \\  / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu |||--- Blacksburg, Virginia   \\/ /_/                  (703) 232-6529 ---

Thisis obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people wereimmoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to lookrather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, inwhat way is it better to worship a single god whose presence issymbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some ofwhose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By theBible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidencethat the followers of the various other religions of the area and timewere particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.>[...scissors and cloth...] Now in the past, our ancestors>did cut cloth with scissors, but they at least knew that>their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth,>so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from>their earlier barbarism, and made the transition to>modern civilized paper-cutting that much easier."Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I seeno support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumaneneighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean thatthe actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, suchdehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, oreven of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.>|> That complex>|> and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic>|> interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't>|> think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it>|> to attack condemnation of the original history.Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instanceclaiming that Hammurabi's "an eye for an eye" was primitive brutalretribution, while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).

First, you are discussing onlyexperimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  Themain criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to makeprediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could bethe result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activityoccuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations ofthe lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that theobservations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -it is*not* about predicting the future except in this very restrictedsense.Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really justtherequirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.Theobservation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observermaylook at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds willcorrespondto the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this istested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies someconclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway beenperipheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, thefront legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in thenecessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat theoriginalevent does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determinationof the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].--sarima@teradata.com                     (formerly tdatirv!sarima)  orStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.comsarima@teradata.com(formerly tdatirv!sarima)  orStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com

You got me thinking now!This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a move in society to classify previously "socially unacceptable" yet legal activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two coexisting methods of social control.First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set of punishments.Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of social censure.The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as "guilt" and "morality".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be absolutely impossible.Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't illegal, then don't pick on me).  I'm not saying this is wrong, merely that it is a byproduct of a society which has:1) A high education level,2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and4) A "me" oriented culture.I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as those freedoms don't impinge on another's.IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the continued destabilization of society.  I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms in order to "stabilize" society.  Yet I believe development of societies follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a social model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is possible to live with a "non-stable" society?Anybody see a way out?  Comments?PS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don't.

Secondly, your observation that peopledisagree shows nothing - people may be looking at different things,by virtue of being in different situations.  If I look at an elephant, I'll see an elephant.  That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you look at an iguana.    Thirdly, I question your assumption that whenpeople disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals, that they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals (that seems to be the disagreement you refer to).-- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANICYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is topanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get rightwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation.  "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." - Matthew 24:13II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATIONThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time ofthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as "the time of Jacob's(Israel's) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniel's Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEMSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community (the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible willbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation.IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFESince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, itis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and canquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect tounfold before you.  V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFEPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for thesake of Christ.  VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVEDONES DIE AS MARTYRSAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, hewill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will beuseless.  "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and thatno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understandingcalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His numberis 666" - Revelation 13:16-18.  The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killedin the past, such as the Holocaust.[or maybe the crusades? -M]You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist'srule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I sawunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God andfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would bekilled as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11.His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his imageor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his markon their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4.  He will use everyform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Norwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to takethe mark.  If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while andgain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lakeof Fire.  "...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine ofthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation 14:9-10 [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given tothe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVALAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's governmentuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who areextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural ormountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the leastpopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweepinto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps schoolclosings" --M] Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything withoutthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive wastefrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.[Get a good water filter. --M]Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.VIII. TRUST NO ONEThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist'sgovernment.  Be on the lookout.[Perot supporters take note --M]IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRISTIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who willbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and ahalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economicexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, whichhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect willbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], whowill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three anda half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return ofChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not takethe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved orremain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death."May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!******************************************************************************Mike Cluff*  "Christianity is Stupid.v22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms*   Give up." -NegativlandUB Language Perception Laboratory*  ******************************************************************************/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,and sank Manhattan out at sea.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pk., MD 20742Lines: 43Jon Livesey writes:>So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had "different>versions" of some OT texts.   Did I misunderstand?Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea inthe world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject ofreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real"story (that is, a bigger headline).Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, thevarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and theSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is thestandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it hasobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums andto the Septuagint.Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there arevariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predatingthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best ofmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, andhave little theological import.The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all ofIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  Thereis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is nosign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in theseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variationsbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect theseptuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, thedifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this bigexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in thematerial, but so far this hasn't happened.The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in theOT, unlike for the NT.-- C.

Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not."What is atheism?"Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strongatheism".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weakatheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strongatheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials."But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism."What is agnosticism then?"The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only whenreferring to "strong atheism".Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe."So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists."But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable."But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?"One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "theredefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn'tatheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  "religion" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV."OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?"Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist."If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separationof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate."But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?"The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say."What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?"Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives."You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?"There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not mybirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical."You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently."How do atheists differ from religious people?"They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance."Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable("wrong") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify theiractions.  For example:  "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever."The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour."Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being."Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make."But don't atheists want to believe in God?"Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the"Big Brother" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief."But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!"Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile."Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thingthat has a "meaning".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is themeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is."So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck."Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"The short answer is "No, do you?"Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it."So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?"No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else."What sort of harm?"Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion."Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse."What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, allconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian."Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still."Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well."But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?"Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another."What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?"For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise."So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?"Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it."Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.and finally (and most importantly):   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: 2.2iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----For information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.

An atheist does notbelieve in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.  If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump usall together.As for the issues, let's start with abortion.  Personally, I do not supportabortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact.However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardlessof what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tellany individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domainof legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That's my opinion, and Iam sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals wouldbe angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship asnothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.  As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea whatyou're talking about.Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.

I suggest you take a look at P.W. Atkins's classic text _Physical Chemistry_(4th ed., Oxford University Press 1990) to see how chemistry is taught today.However, I still agree with your point - concepts must be allowed tooperate at a pragmatic level. In chemistry, this usually means we must usedifferent models for different situations. It is unfair to say thatchemists simply ignore effects they can't deal with - on the contrary,they are quite concerned with the limitations of their models.  : I remember thinking, the first time I saw the shapes of the electron: orbitals, "They have *got* to be kidding..."If someone insists that electron is _confined_ inside these shapes,it would indeed constitute a joke.

The surfaces are arbitrary, and not really important - what is more important (in chemistry) are the signs of the wavefunctions.Is there something wrong with the representations?-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather thantechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, heremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:"Galactic Pot-Healer"A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to aremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When thedeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright isunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel."A Maze of Death"Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion."VALIS"The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of GnosticChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam ofunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic anddismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters."The Divine Invasion"God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns fromanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must beassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.MARGARET ATWOOD"The Handmaid's Tale"A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriouslyassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to liveunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and theradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punishedretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" arehunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used toat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.VARIOUS AUTHORS"The Bible"This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revisededition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.J. L. MACKIE"The Miracle of Theism", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements forGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.JAMES A.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women aredifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Muchrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" byAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topicand is well referenced. Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can onlyadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they aredifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and womenare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes intoaccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rulesit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in thisinstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example ofwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the sameextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much aman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  Andtherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because thesexism here just reflects the "sexism" of nature in making men and womendifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women whichare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these Irecommend you have a look at the book "Brainsex".Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologicallybecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required forpregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  Youare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supportsmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.  As I>understand most religious sexual discrimination, and I doubt that>Islam is exceptional, the female is not allowed into the priestly>caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to>rights which, as an equal human, she ought to be entitled to.There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function istaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars andfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example fromearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognizedin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.>No matter how sweetly you coat it, part of the role of religions>seems, historically, to have served the function of oppressing the>female, whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where>there is no opportunity for self-improvement, or by denying her>access to the same facilities the males are offered.You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, andI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but Irecently reposted something here under the heading "Islam and Women" --if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is repostedfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism itstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original titlewas though).  I will email it to you if you like. >The Roman Catholic Church is the most blatant of the culprit,>because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy, but the>other religious are no different: let a woman attempt to escape her>role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her.Your statement that "other religions are no different" is, I think, astatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other thanChristianity and perhaps Judaism.>I'll accept your affirmation that Islam grants women the same rights>as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the>same position as (say) Khomeini and there are no artificial religious>or social obstacles on her path to achieve this.Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but alsowas, at one stage, a military leader.>Show me the equivalent of Hillary Rhodam-Clinton within Islam, and I>may consider discussing the issue with you.The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the "Hijra" (theProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when yourviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.

Most of the accusationsand fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from theWahabis. For that matter you should read the original works ofthe Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher ofat least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of theShi'ites). Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating aroundabout the Shi'ites (esp. since the revolution), there are alsomany good works by Shi'ites which present the views and teachingsof their school. Why make assumptions and allegations (likepeople in this group have done about Islam in general) about Shi'ites.

Until human nature changes, the products of ournature won't change, and that has to include society. I think yourassessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic.   What is needed is an absolute moral standard if -all- people are tocreate any Utopias. By implying a Utopian future, you also argue foran absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case.

The are many other possible explainations.  Could have beenthat he never existed.

People ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did ->heal people.  Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn'tmean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is notconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,so the stories got bigger to appeal better.->Niether was he a lunatic.

Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those whouse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, becausein the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments amongthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excludingall other possible alternatives.However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one ofthe other two alternative is no longer valid.->Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I ->write I will use it.JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to makesure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.

The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematicalsystems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behindthought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively "pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuitof money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when itis a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in orderto personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So thereis still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in theapproach of the "detached, objective" scientist. >>Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,>>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.

That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ fact, not just a fact-in-itself.

But thenI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convicton a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probablywould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravatedassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, whichnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under Californialaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that the first jury decided that the officers were "not guilty".  Note, not "not guilty" of doing wrong, but "not guilty" of aggravated assault with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.

Up there someone says that relativismdoesn't mean that all moral systems are equal.  So, what *does*relativism mean?

Is it:(a) Both are right(b) One of them is wrong, and sometimes (though perhaps rarely) we have a     pretty good idea who it is(c) One of them is wrong, but we never have any information as to who, so    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision.(d) The idea of a "right" moral judgement is meaningless (implying that     whether peace is better than war, e.g., is a meaningless question,     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer)(e) Something else.  A short, positive assertion would be nice.As I hope you can tell, (b) and (c) are actually predicated onthe assumption that values are real  - so statements like these_can't_ consistently derive from the relativist assumption that valuesaren't part of objective reality.  -- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

I'm looking for a way to say>"yes" to that question, and relativism isn't it.Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thingover another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider thoseaspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying acommitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long &healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it isincomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the mostagressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulatingproduction.

An atheist is one for whom all things can: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine orspiritual explanations. It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understoodas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do notrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.However, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-correcting, with nature as its judge. It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longera bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics topsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safefrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness. There is no need: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is: determnined.Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehowsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not haveany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparentfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from theirperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a freewill or not? : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - whenduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to controlone third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicatesand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the sameprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating willsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o): For an atheist, no: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-: an event can have value. From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, frommy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not havea perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjectiveperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and ifI think about what it would it be like in their position, I willeventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarilya gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identityis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respectothers who seem to have identity, too. Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)for starters.: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to: establish your values.C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason whyhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument isseverely flawed.Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Someothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably itsroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very realpossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruisticbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved betterand better in building and using tools, they also became betterat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution couldonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one'sown people.The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jewswas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the peopletogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about peopleof other nations. At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jewswere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignorethe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and alongwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.): Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries: no weight in any "absolute" sense.It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever thereis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a resultof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observercomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose theirmeaning. It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point ofview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truthsdo not exist. The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt othersis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existenceby becoming social beings who can think and value others'existence.Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins andmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins havesometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. : That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been: conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there isevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality verywell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsismis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjectivepoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this pointof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does notcease to be subjective. From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neitherdoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are inherently subjective. Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or evento make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us ifwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals comefrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same thanto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If godgave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not myfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is thepoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one'sown and then to get mad at this. God must be schizophrenic.: All of this being so, you have excluded: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no: weight whatsoever.Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understandwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any wayless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is hisown point of view, and his morals are his own. Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

In an old interviewrebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a timea few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on arespirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination.

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act onfaith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  Thatis what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, orbelief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)justification.For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't knowwhy they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief basedon new information, or increased mental faculty.>>So Christians are totally irrational?

The faith and dogma part of any religionare responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim thatfaith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If thatmakes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy ratherthan a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,because there is no faith nor dogma.>>>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,>>whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present>>in any religion.>>Again, this statement is too general.

If a philosopheris not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity isa special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existenceof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogmacomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an exampleof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.Sure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy theneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,and that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if theinterpretations are flawed.Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has aBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change tosuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefsare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improvingthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflectthe best information currently available.  That's the only rationalthing to do.  That's good philosophy.Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How manyscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understandingof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religionviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations ofthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired whichconflicts with them.>>Please explain how "just because" thinking kills people.

I have already made the clear claim thatKhomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'anand have given my arguments for this. This is something that can bechecked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini hasresponded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This shouldbe quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionistmodes of obfuscationism. So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical nature.Gregg

I couldname quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn'tmentioned before). In other words, you have nothing to fulfill your strongclaims with.  >#One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,>#while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees>#with a set of morals YOU have to give.>>I'm not doing morals (ethics) if we can't get past values.

I don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets wereloaded terms are fixpoints. Those who deny the morality of freedom make quiteclear what they say, their practice is telling. Yes, there are even those whoare willingly unfree. It is quite common in religions, by the way. For one,there is a religion which is named Submission. Don't even try to argue that submission is freedom.  >#Further, the above is evidence, not proof.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction tologic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [ConciseOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whetherit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need tostudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basicknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing anargument.Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universallyapplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merelyexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic isthe right tool for the job.Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. Aproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It israining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said tobe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaningof "deny", not the everyday meaning.The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particulararrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists aGod" both express the same proposition.An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series ofstatements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists ofthree stages.First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument tocontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  Theyare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because","since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed withsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspiciouspremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid toquestion it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious" whenyou've heard the explanation.)Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process knownas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis ofone or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms ofvalid inference.The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in furtherinference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or"therefore".Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition whichis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are oftenindicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude"and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.For example:Every event has a cause (premise)The universe has a beginning (premise)All beginnings involve an event (premise)This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in anotherargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion withrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if sometimes a little confusing.Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises orconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without everproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Somestatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar, or the Son of God."This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assertthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'llcome to those later.)Another example:"God created you; therefore do your duty to God."The phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neithertrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not anargument.Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A becauseB".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, thestatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, thenit is not an argument, it is an explanation.For example:"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not start." -- This is an argument."My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine." -- This is an explanation.There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  Adeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion mustalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A validargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then theconclusion is true.An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for thetruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than otherarguments, and about how probable their premises are.There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductivenor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductivearguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid doesnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider morecarefully.Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, anargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. For example:   All insects have wings (premise)   Woodlice are insects (premise)   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. The argument is thus entirely valid.More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,as in:   All fish live in the sea (premise)   Dolphins are fish (premise)   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through validinference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" forimplication.The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. "T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.Premise Conclusion Inference   A        B        A=>B----------------------------   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                             false, the inference must be invalid.   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                             the conclusion must be true.A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confusevalid arguments with sound arguments.To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would requirelengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probablymore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructingan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.In everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefsas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fairenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form oftechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid orconvincing.So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logicalargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrectwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid beingmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to beexhaustive.ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or thethreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  Itis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right". The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.For example:"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those whorefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEMArgumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of tryingto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person orpeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of anassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.For example:"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way ofreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and notargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness'stestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of theArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a personargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because ofthe opponent's particular circumstances.For example:"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argueotherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?"This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissingthe opponent's argument.This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For example:"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. You're white."This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one'sadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, isalso known as "poisoning the well".ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUMArgumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacyoccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because ithas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued thatsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that thisis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been provedtrue, a basic scientific principle.)Examples:"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.""Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody hasshown any proof that they are real."Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one isgenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would producecertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of waterto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore nosuch flood occurred."In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something hasnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,however.ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAMThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted.  For example:"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find meguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUMThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  Tocommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion byappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is oftencharacterized by emotive language.  For example:"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.""The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you tryingto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAMThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists ofasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the morelikely it is that that proposition is correct.ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAMThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and winsupport for an assertion.  For example:"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, referenceto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to adiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearlybetween:"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"and"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer"Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on blackhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENTThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to aparticular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule isinapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to thespecific.  For example:"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you mustdislike atheists."This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decideevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATIONThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when oneforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are notrepresentative of all possible cases.For example:"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians areinsincere."SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITERA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to aparticular situation in which the features of that particular situationrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of ahasty generalization.NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOCThese are known as False Cause fallacies.The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as thecause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For example:"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So Godcured me of the headache."The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed tobe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For example:"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoidatheism for the same reasons."CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOCThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts thatbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leavesno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.PETITIO PRINCIPIIThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as theconclusion reached.CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDOThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which onewishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that thefallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence anygovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be opento blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold governmentoffice."Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reasonfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. Another example is the classic:"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that theBible is true because it is the word of God."COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATIONThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded question:"Have you stopped beating your wife?"The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has noteven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,when they ask questions like:"Where did you hide the money you stole?"Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"or"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"IGNORATIO ELENCHIThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to dowith that conclusion.For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that theteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at lengththat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well heargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouseemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a morefavourable light.EQUIVOCATIONEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more differentmeanings in the same argument.  For example:"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that itremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place alicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."AMPHIBOLYAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous becauseof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.ACCENTAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement areemphasized.  For example, consider:"We should not speak ILL of our friends"and"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"FALLACIES OF COMPOSITIONOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the partsof something must apply to the whole.  For example:"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very lightweight."The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a numberof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore carsare less environmentally damaging than buses."FALLACY OF DIVISIONThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Likeits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that aproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared byeach item.  For example:"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENTThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmfulevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by thefirst event.For example:"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroinand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannotlegalize marijuana.""A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIESThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some waysimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.Examples:"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form ofhistory?""Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam aform of Christianity?""Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form ofanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENTThis fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore Ais true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table forimplication given earlier.DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENTThis fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore Bis false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this isa fallacy.Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter hasthe form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT infact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication isinvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduceanything about B.CONVERTING A CONDITIONALThis fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAMThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simplybecause it is old, or because "that's the way it's always been."ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAMThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy ofasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newerthan something else.ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAMThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that thosewith more money are more likely to be right.ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUMThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder ormore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of theargumentum ad crumenam.ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAMThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true themore often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employsconstant repetition in asserting something.BIFURCATIONAlso referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs whenone presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact otheralternatives exist or can exist.PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONSThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complexquestion.NON SEQUITURA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premiseswhich are not logically connected with it.RED HERRINGThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issuebeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from thepoints being made, towards a different conclusion.REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATIONReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOFThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion orproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum adignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person whodenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy isthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.STRAW MANThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that itcan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is afallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have beenmade.THE EXTENDED ANALOGYThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested generalrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other.This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation:"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King.""Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation?

I'm saying the Universe has a "real age", because I see evidencefor it; cosmology, astronomy and so on.

If morality was"objective", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir'incorrect' morality seems to function fine. How come?

Morality is not a necessity for a functionalcollection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the samething?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many differentsituations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Somespecies of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of malebees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. Thebees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so wasit immoral? Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes tothe basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards arebased upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moralstandards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations,because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that,yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to beimpressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it mayactually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be calledmurder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked,but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society willcondone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, includinghow you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been sociallyimbued).Jeff.I keep trying to write a book of ideas in two paragraphs and it just comesout disorganised garble!

Before going much further on that thread,I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of worldreligions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well astheistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge aboutsuch things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no suchclaims. My perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is thattalk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about anafterlife, then I'll start believing in one.

However that does not mean that I'm willing toaccept a lot of fourth hand gobbly-gook that contridicts modern sciencealong with my theistic perspective.>> >>     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist>>    _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian>>   _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality>>        _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility>> _/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...>Nancieric

The viewpoint I follow -- that there is in general no> punishment for apostasy -- is _very_ strongly supported by Qur'an and> hadith.  This is very well shown in the book "Punishment in Islamic Law"> by Mohamed S. El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).> I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is littlejustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since thereis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates havebeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.However, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God andHis Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge ofapostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts publicattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, thesituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreadsslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situationchanges. The punishments vary according to the situationthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravatedapostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situationand being in the situation where someone unilaterallywages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual couldbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there isa clear difference between a formal war situation (where twoclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchangeprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolatedindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, the unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that would apply in the case of Rushdie.The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book (banning the book is secondary) -a full set of circumstances following the publication ofthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of manyMuslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believethat one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding "circumstance ofrevelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of theverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstancein which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could saythat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when theMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended whenthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-lifesituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which canall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internalrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such thatarriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and howeach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.It is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There maybe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context inwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these mattersimpinge on the situation.In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection mustentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then eachperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain totheState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogatingverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate betweena permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse ofMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances of revelation, and does not understand the technical words ofthe Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend theknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing anddelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear fromthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginningfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains thesubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and thedetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of theduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; anddoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to thosecoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not knowthe Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an....".Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anicverses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn people when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)),a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirementsfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce onmatters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within theseheadings.- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.- Logic (mantiq)- A knowledge of Hadiths- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,Reasoning)The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:- discussion of imperatives (awamir)- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)- discussion of unconditional and conditional- discussion of tacit meanings- discussion of the abstract and the clear- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogatedThe principles of Application of the law involves:- principles of exemption- principles of precaution- principles of option- principles of masteryThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous processin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matterof looking at one verse and one hadith. Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a differencebetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who isclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is thefamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,and wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messengerof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied:"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear foryour religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imamsof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith appliesto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My onlypoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls intoplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertiseare praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisiteknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion are cautioned.The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in thisgroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at leastbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as ahereticbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance ofcreating a straw man and then beating him.> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.

This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am ratherdubious of a lot of the source theories.There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT isobscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy tocopy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same "errors".  This would appear to tellus that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts veryexactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they didbefore that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at thepoint at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (andin some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for themost part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some peoplelike to use the game of "telephone" as a metaphor for the transmission ofthe texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.-- C.

So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.It seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point isthat you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomenainappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a "global" frameof reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off from ours on Earth.This is simply wrong.  There is NO global "time" which can be applied toevents on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is whatSpecial Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth ata high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the _order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to the question, "what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?" is NOT well-defined, ifasked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relativevelocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different values of these parameters.Now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes very important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity say that it does.  We would _like_ to say "the falling object is hoveringabove the horizon, NOW", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly "away"from ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the holeits gone forever from our ken.  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it,that is... :-) Gene Battin battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu no .sig yet

Do you claimto have an objective one?  I'll assume your answer is "yes," apologiesif not."Objective" means is that different observers will get the same results.The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system.  I'd beinterested in seeing a summary of your system, though I appreciate thatit might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing.In your post above you objected to "situational morals."  Perhaps youcould begin by explaining how you objectively set the situationalboundaries of an act, in your system.  I don't think you can do it.Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point.  I think ofa situation, and you have to say whether it is moral or not, and why.In your move you can1) Ask me any objective question about the situation, or2) Pronounce judgement.After you have pronounced judgement, I get to add whatever context I liketo the situation, provided I don't change anything I have already said.If I can change the context to one where your objective system would givea different answer, then your system is faulty.  (Since I don't know whatyour system is, either you must write it down, or at least be consistent.)Do you think your system could pass this test?-Norman

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.If only those christian "scientists" would take note.(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactlytrue, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justifiedby using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that theerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been accounted for. :-] )>The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a >modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.

People >gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing >someone who was or had been healed.  Millions of people have "died for a lie".  This  point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious argumentswork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victoryof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.>Call me a fool, but I believe he did heal people.  That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight tothe claim that Jesus was the "real thing".>Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn >to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example >anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see >this right away.Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to thepoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and hismany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitlerwas sane.... >Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the >real thing.  Hmmm....

I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I >write I will use it.This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had withpeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I thinkpeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort ofmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying topresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he orshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believethe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting thebook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say "a isequal to b because a is equal to b".  >I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.

I have never really understood why the emotional sentimentsof a stranger should be of interest to other people.

In judging the practicalconsequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today,it is precisely the Khomeini's of the world, the Rushdie-fatwasupporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the worldMuslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhapsunfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concernedwith whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether theQur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but howIslam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be likeif Islam gains in influence.

From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew: "Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that wouldremain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  Forinstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on anothersimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as aplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, thecontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even ifthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is todetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can beestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of whatis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) thenthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Norcan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guidingcontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true invirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide toaction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist maytalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claimthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is leftof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist maywell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgementswith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinionis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to havepreferences regarding human activity." David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shovedin its entirety into the "subjective" category by an idealist or solipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternateset of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reducedto (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and whyyes, I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of the beholder.#>>If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?All of it.#>If nothing, then NO moral judgements are true.

If that's correct, end of one point...Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept.His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him,and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a memberof a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the waysof the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum.The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the Westwe have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of controland of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I thinkthe majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say"in agreement") with the idea that you are finally responsible to thesecular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person mayhave chosen.With that in mind, it not possible under secular law ("legally" as mostpeople would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group oncethey decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agreethat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is thereany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or pastgroup member.A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional dutiesof a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those dutiesin many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes whenthe enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person_in conflict with secular law_.This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secularauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements_may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ ormay not coincide with secular consequences (if any).Regards,Dew-- Dewey Henize Sys/Net admin RISC hardware (512) 891-8637 pager 928-7447 x 9637

Now to say> that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P(x | H) =  P(x | HG).> Can you elaborate some on this.Well, "P(x | A) = P(x | B)" means that x is as likely to be observed if A isoperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does notprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate betweenthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the differencereduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) priorprobabilities P(A) and P(B):  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).So A and B are "equally consistent with the data" in that observing xdoesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that theirprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't knowthe actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor tothrow out any such HG.> Also, in the "real world" it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems > to me. We can't always determine whether the equality "P(x | H) =  > P(x | HG)" is true. That's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether ornot a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religionin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religiousimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.Now it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religiousbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather*less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I wouldexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutualexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn'teven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,G is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happilyacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.> BTW, my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one - > I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very  > careful so there probably isn't a "math mistake".

I'm not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of > statistician), so this would be very helpful. Not that I'm a statistician as such either, but:The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all ofthe (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type withwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may beanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenableto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene inmeasurable ways.This means that these regions of the space of possible observations, which I loosely termed "appearances of god/s", have some nonzeroprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis toscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theismexpends on making "appearances of god/s" possible must come from somewhereelse (i.e. other possible observations).All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an"appearance of god/s" must have a slightly higher probability underatheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that suchobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability ofthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decreasein my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult toput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the propertiesof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the totalarea under them is always unity.An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is "thecoin is fair", and that B is "the coin is unfair (two-headed)". (I'veused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)Then  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1  P(T | A) = 0.5  }  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1  P(T | B) = 0    }The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatiblewith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probabilityexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though theydon't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total mustbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearanceof heads.Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). Theobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates aremodified according to                            P(H | A)  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                              P(H)and                            P(H | B)  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                              P(H)Now we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, butthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every timethe coin is tossed and a head is observed.Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have                 n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)and                    n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A mustdecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B mustincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.The loose analogy is between "unfair coin" and atheism, and between "faircoin" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, whichwould falsify "unfair coin", is analogous to an "appearance of god/s",which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extendsto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principleis the same.>> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them >                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>> the notional estimated probability that they don't exist, > It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could> be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't.> Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible,> it doesn't make sense to say "lack of evidence" supports the contrary > view.Quite so, but this type of theism is what I might call "the G in the HG",in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion, and I'd bin it on those grounds.> So it depends upon your conception of this god.

We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any*prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for thefair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the correspondingmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimateseither. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) forobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certainevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possibleunder Ha, and all else is equal.> Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations.

Maybe I'm not> understanding what you mean by "prediction" - could you explain what> you mean by this word?I'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require ofa theism is that it *not* make the prediction "Appearances of god/s willnever happen", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantummechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is thatQM and atheism do not form a partition.)Predictions include such statements as "Prayer is efficacious" (implying"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious"), or "Prayeris *not* efficacious", or "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall notpass, till all these things be fulfilled." I don't think we have any problemsof misunderstanding here.>> Persistent observation of this stuff not happening, *consistent* with>> Ht though it may be, is *more* consistent with Ha, as explained in the>> Bayesian stats post. >>>> Even if Ht ("God exists") is unfalsifiable, that's>> no problem for my argument, other than that you have to let the number >> of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically. > BTW, I do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of > observations as valid - or rather that part of the argument is not valid. > We, as existing humans, can never make an infinite number of measurments > and any conclusion that reilies on this I don't accept as valid.That's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finitenumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, andthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.> [Renormalization stuff deleted]>> In the Bayesian stats post, I assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable>> in a finite number of observations.

I could be wrong on this statment - [...contd]I think you are; an "appearance of god/s" is sufficient to falsifyatheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.> I'll think more about it.

No: by way of a counterexample, let X = "the coin is fair", or moreaccurately (so that not(X) makes sense) "the two sides of the coin aredifferent". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string ofheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinitenumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit.

The concepts of "right"#and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the#domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no#sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is#legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).##Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives#of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.#One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,#veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little#sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is#strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can#certainly ask that question about motives.##Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:#they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.True, by "correct" I mean "the thing valued is really good".  I shoulduse evaluative terms, but I don't always.  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing.Can you answer if "betterness" is used in in place of @correctness"?##Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with#the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a#meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is#irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that#one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make#value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"#of the position.You can never say that the thing is @really better@, or "more likelyto better, from all realistic frames of reference"?##Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is#that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,#neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold#different moral values (feelings).This is where my difficulty arises, though I'm starting to getin now.  The thing is, there isn't anything simple about differentmoral values, when those values are human rights.#"A ruthless, doctrinaire avoidance of degeneracy is a degeneracy of# another sort.

And the chief priests...bought with them the potter's field.">What was Jesus' prediction regarding Peter's denial?Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30>How many times did the cock crow?MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the word  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt denyme thrice.

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied methrice.JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.>destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! Not the only time he does this either...)MAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, saying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that wasvalued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;zechariah 11:11-13(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?scarlet - Matthew 27:28purple John 19:2>The time of the CrucifictionMark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) waswhen the sentence was passed.>Inscription on the CrossMatthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the JewsMark --  The King of the JewsLuke --  This is the king of the JewsJohn --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews>What did they give him to drink?vinegar - Matthew 27:34wine with myrrh - Mark 15:23>Women at the CrossMatthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother ofJames, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many faroff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.John says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister andMary Magdalene.>Jesus' last words Matt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, whyhast thou forsaken me?"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,yielded u the ghost."Luke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."John19:30: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished:" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.">Events of the crucifictionMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was anearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that gravesopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing tomany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness andthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. John is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.>Burial of JesusMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from beingstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this wassupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.>How long was Jesus in the tomb?Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he willspend "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth", and Mark 10:34has "after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again". As far as I cansee from a quick look, the prophecies have "after three days", but thepost-resurrection narratives have "on the third day".>Time of the ResurectionMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says itwas dark.> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the firstday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come andanoint him.JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from thesepulchre.>Whom did they see at the tomb?MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of theLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,and sat upon it.MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white assnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became asdead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fearnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's bodyMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makesthis claim.>Appearences of the risen JesusMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also toldthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then wentto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his onlyappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five versesto the visit with the disciples.Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and thatthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later heappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, toEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them butwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finallyrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,they told thedisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fishand honey and then preached to them.John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, inJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, butThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joinedthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.Oncemore Jesus made anappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was notrecognised. After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesusbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eattogether and converse.The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showedhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thuscontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of thingspertaining to the kingdom of God: "And when he had spoken these things, whilethey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stoodby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand yegazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven" Acts 1:3-11Paul outdoes every other "authority" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500persons between the time of the resurection and theassension, although he does not say where.He also claims that he himself "asone born out of due time" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.>The AscensionMatthew says nothing about it.Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved intoheaven after he was finished talking with thedisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and thatwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. John says nothing about it.  Actscontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)>When second coming?MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till allthese things be fulfilled.MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, tillall these things be done.LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, tillall be fulfilled.1 thessalonians 4:15-18>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention 1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountainwhere Jesus had appointed them.> ascend to heaven"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (2 Kings 2:11)"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, ...the Son of Man." (John 3:13)As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of thetrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! (In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would thinkthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedlyobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort oftruth.)

I'll post a couple of these a day  unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good  material.  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving  attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,  but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest  of my entire collection.________________________________________________________                                  So that the                                  Prophecy be                                   Fulfilled                                     * * *       In considering the Christian religion, and judging itaccording to its claims, it is important to look at its claims atfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not evenabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel:       We begin, of course, at the beginning.       (Mt 1.21-22):  "[Mary] will bear a son, and you,       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is       salvation), for he will save his people from their       sins."  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet:       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the       lord G'd said to Isaiah, "go to meet with Ahaz..."        ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,       naturally) saying, "Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven."  But,       Ahaz said, "I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a       test."  Then (Isaiah) said, "Hear then, O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman       is with child and will bear a son, and name him       "Immanuel," which means, "G'd is with us."   He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word "almah," (young woman), asspecifically, "virgin."  But, this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  Inshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of bylater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called bythe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt:       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about aquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:       "Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son."What the lord really said was this.       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.        And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them (my people), the more they went from me; they       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, itwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps:        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes,       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:       "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;       she refused to be consoled, because they were       no more."   The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are "nomore."  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, whowas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus andBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her "children,"it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem)."       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhancethe message of the church's gospel.       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The "children" the prophetspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'dcomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will bereturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, thiswould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again, the "prophecy" Matthew sets up is not eventhat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene:       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,        [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who "He" is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother thatshe will,       [Judges 13.5]  "...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines."This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases:       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases."As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as theinstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a "servant" going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, butrather something that had already happened.  While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to saythat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah:      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arousethe attention of the local rulers.       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.          "Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his       name."The Isaiah passage quoted reads,       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing, never would the "light" of mankindburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all willbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic "...the coastlands await his law." to theChristologic, "the Gentiles will hope in his name."   While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of "believing in the name."  If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has onlyto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant, "a people robbed andplundered..."   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at"prophecy" is examined, it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights:      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a "day" was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our timescale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the "ninthhour," which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, "rose,"before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wasover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time forclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, twonights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's littlemistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.Hearing &Understanding:     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, ifyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will notaccept the "plain" message any better.  Matthew says,       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,        "You will indeed hear but never understand; and you       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal       them."The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel isflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, "Go, and say to this       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and       turn and be healed."  Then Isaiah said, "How long,       lord?"  And he said, "Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled." The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the planof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Lookat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portionof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn'tunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses arenot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in thepresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet, "I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world."Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet, but from the Psalms.       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children, but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, onceagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things "known, that our fathers have toldus."  Jesus deals with things "hidden since the foundation of theworld."  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith:       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to "dispossess" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no moreenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, sayingthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded inancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding inheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.       Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to seeGod anymore.       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're       sinful; it's just his "plan"; we put too many of our       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dearreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to betrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching yourheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, theysay, "See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing G'd."   Thus people getlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everydaysights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion ofhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, theforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these arewhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.\fJesus Rides onan Ass:       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.         [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet, saying,       Tell the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a       ass-colt."Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-       colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariahonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he hasbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little "prophetic" things ANDsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems tofit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew, "Haven't you read?" for the source reads,       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no "perfect praise"spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to bejust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...:      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is kingDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,       "The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until       I put your enemies under your feet."Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying tomake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems.       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David'srule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of themessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, likehis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, andwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,       YHVH's utterance to my lord:"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your       footstool."       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.         "You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever."The word "lord" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, theword is "adoni," and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means"lord," a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either "a psalm of David," or "a psalm aboutDavid."  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If thepsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descendedfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensivetales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show offavour for David's kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As wemight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses & Jesus,Had it TogetherAll Along...:       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on thepromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The Potter'sField:      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief       priests, taking the silver, said, "It isn't lawful for       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood       money."  So they... bought a potter's field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,       "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's       field, as the lord directed me."This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, "Cast       them to the treasury," --the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likelya priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word, "treasury," had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with "to the potter," precisely because this madeMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed "treasury," which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas "potter'sfield" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, givenMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and ifas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,the "prophecy" as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincingenough.Wine, Vinegar,& Casting Lots:      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,       "They parted my garments among them, and upon my       vesture did they cast lots."First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink --not polluted with gall.       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, "I thirst."  A bowl of       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished;"But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from theprophets, but one from the Psalms.       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the "Jesus" in thepsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the "crucifiers," whereas theJesus of the gospels says,       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, the       don't know what they do!"Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not hismeat, as the psalm stipulates.       With the "prophecy" of the vinegar faulty, we naturallyask, "What of the casting of lots?"  This brings up the 22ndPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm:      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!        Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, ratherthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like "thelamb led mute before its shearers."  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do muchgroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads;  "He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him."This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words "have pierced" reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase "like the lion" and a very rare verb formwhich can mean "pierced" differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally, "like the lion" (ka'ari),which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to "ka'aru."   But, toadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the "prophecy" this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but ratherthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been "enhanced" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus'scrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years afterthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...       "The will look on him whom they've pierced."Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.\fReckoned withTransgressors:       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says,       "He was reckoned with the transgressors."Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and itssurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the "prophecy" in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how "those who were crucified with[Jesus] also reviled him." [15.32]  This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed, "Aren't you the messiah?! Save       yourself, and us!"This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said, "Save yourself!" and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,       "Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,       "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."        And Jesus answered, "Verily I say to you, today you       will be with me in paradise."Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we haveseen.The End of theWorld--       Mt. 24:       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, andhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your       coming, and of the close of the age?       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for       many will come in my name, saying, "I am the christ."         ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death,       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these       things, you will know that He is near, at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that itwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, "this generationshall not pass away..." really means "this race of people will notpass away..."  Of course, the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (atleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting forjust the right moment to spring?       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, orthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or threeeternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around, and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughoutChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to supportwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: "Don't think that I have come to       bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace,       but rather a sword."

For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  "The           demonstration that no possible combination of known           substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of           force, can be united in a practical machine by which man           shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer           as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any           physical fact to be."                          Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright           Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final           word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they           crash).                          Today, orthodox physicists and other "scientists" are           saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy'           Technologies, using negative terms such as "pseudo-science"           and "perpetual motion", and citing so-called "laws" which           assert that "energy cannot be created or destroyed" ("1st law           of thermodynamics") and "there is always a decrease in useful           energy" ("2nd law of thermodynamics").  The physicists do not           know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare           that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF           IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern "science" and help to           cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox           modern theories.                          Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a           seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT           SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated           pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment.                          Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy,           but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by           various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices,           they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they           can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy           has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by           clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced           by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and           high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and           often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are           suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly           designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                          For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058,           #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for           motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly           tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic           field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to           be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in           "Science & Mechanics" magazine, Spring 1980, ("Amazing           Magnet-Powered Motor", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117,           and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes,           orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such           a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible           heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete           descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the           U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA            22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.  Or try           getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your           local public or university library's inter-library loan           dept..]                          A second type of free-energy device, such as the 'Gray           Motor' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the 'Tesla Coil', and the           motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages           571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from           'EARTH RESONANCE' (about 12 cycles per second plus           harmonics).  They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit           which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the           energy being tapped.  It is important that the total           'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to           'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in           order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be           increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER'           of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a           Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the           secondary coil will enhance output power.  ["Earth Energy:           Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems", by John Bigelow, 1976,           Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.]                          During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named           Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an           'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after           analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped           waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical           equations to explain it.  As described in the book "A           Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources", by Dan A. Davidson,           1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a           LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a           CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer           touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump,           which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC           GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that           of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A           TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                          A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock           Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between           a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression           ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and           planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running           by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also           generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat           buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large           trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.            [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the           automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.]                          Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown           in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between           metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of           particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a           common household smoke detector.                          One other energy source should be mentioned here,           despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free           Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph           Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION           reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive           deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities           from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be           converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting           steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power           a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the           "Tokamaks" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about,           Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power           for every watt put in.  ["New Times" (U.S. version), 6-26-78,           pages 32-40.]                          And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that           have been in the news lately, originally conducted by           University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin           Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake           Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of           chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the           bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with           mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which           PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough           of it to explain the excess heat generated.                          There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called "laws"           of thermodynamics are NOT so "absolute".  For example, the           late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail           in several books such as "Nothing But Motion" (1979) and "The           Universe of Motion" (1984)), in which the physical universe           has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter           half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing           between them, with-OUT the "heat death" predicted by           thermodynamic "laws".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH           BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena           that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some           Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow,           seemingly converting "low-quality energy" into "high-quality           energy".                          Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat'           and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe           is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of           existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV           channels, as described in books like "The Path of the           Masters", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and "Eckankar: The Key           to Secret Worlds", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example,           the next level up from the physical universe is commonly           called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups           have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and           report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy           could flow down from these higher levels into the physical           universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given           the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is           supported by many successful laboratory-controlled           experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as           those described in the book "Psychic Discoveries Behind the           Iron Curtain".                          In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors           do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop           and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional           energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their           VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If           the government does not intervene, then the total supply of           energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and           will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and           pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE           EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil           spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue           to increase.                          The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development           of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize           private production (until the producers can make it on their           own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of           Free Energy Hardware.                          The long-range effects of such government intervention           would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy           demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining           companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$,           etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to           seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil,           and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for           conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero,           while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high           but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's,           personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that           require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease,           along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be           able to realize the "opportunity costs" of paying electric           utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would           benefit and increase because travelers would not have to           spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government           tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be           obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE           USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                          Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of           business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment           and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People,           that government should serve, rather than the big           corporation$ and bank$.

All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friendfound out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of mymail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must havetrashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the nextday & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post heplaced in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them beforerealizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; heapologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to bea snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neitherchanged his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now heknows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And allthat I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.I believe the reason that he & I "click" instead of "bash" heads is becauseI see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintainingthe status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject Godthan he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people fromthe true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to theworld society.  The "kitchen of heaven" was all we had to look forward toduring the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still existstoday.  I, too, have rejectedan aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too muchhypocricy exists behind the walls of "God's house" beginning with theimages of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday &raise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home whereI can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don't see it happening anytimesoon.Sherlette

It sounds to me like *spirits* have needs that should be>fulfilled by God, but can be "masked" in other ways (drugs etc).>If this is the case, then you can leave out God: just describe>the problem, not the solution.>Spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition tophysical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things likethe need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call these "emotional needs". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only besatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people whoaccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since Ibelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the othersare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--iewe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are deluded--they just haven't recognized it yet.2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brainchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do nothave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritualneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existenceof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjectiveevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything thatI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence anddemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertionis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before, I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the fence by subjective evidence.

No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to getto a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful.The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a majordefining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, andis the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes meas most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on thenet.An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of "social norms" inaction is the "micro" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some verygood introductory essays ("Deference and Demeanor" is a classic), aswell as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult andtheoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But evenat his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavilyjargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims inthe setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectationsof them.  This becomes "systematized" in a "socially mandated" way simplybecause otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonalrealtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter-actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego-tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.We simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is oneof the main exemplars.)--Michael L.

I do remember calling Christianity"silly" and then following that up with information that I was nine yearsold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectuallydishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god'sexistence. I define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", BTW.Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all typesthere, so in answer to your question: "no."Finally, I'd hardly call Christianity "beseiged" in this country. I seldomsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearingcrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, ofcourse, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happeningis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by peoplewho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn'tpracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minoritywho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. >Now I have a question for Bob.

I'm not astudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing andLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implicationsI see are improper, please let me know.I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole asyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something thatwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see"atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserveyour respect?Aw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,here. It's just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. I figure youshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions toyour question.Now, the smoothed feather version:I seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, Iam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* ofChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don'tknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheistsI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheistmotives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), butwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       I'm hoping people reallywant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out severalreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and Iactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with theimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken"people are atheist.Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the naturalstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so manypeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn'tfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenousmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tendto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religionsso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which "breaks" people.It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is anotherreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies :).>I have a >difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>about the subject.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anythingabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think myreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested thatatheists are "broken", hostile people. This post confirms that someoneelse believes it. >>Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says                                              ^^^^^^^^^^>he will need to be proven wrong about it. Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack ofevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implieslack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who saidthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a "seeker" if you like, Idon't. _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say "Idon't believe in any god" rather than my position: "I believe that nogod(s) exist." For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,because they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this isconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants andMethodists from an atheist point of view :).This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes insomething (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). Guess what?My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Isthat really too much to ask?>Well, I don't even waste my time trying. Well, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why thesupposition that you will fail to convince him?

If you don't, or if youobserve things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created10,000 years ago.

No: reasonable alternative exists.I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must bean answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.I have always wondered why Christians use the "There are questionsscience (or atheism) cannot answer" argument; I hope this is theappropriate group to ask this question.The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does theuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?and2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,is it a meaningful question, after all?I would say it isn't. Consider the following:A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubtone's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -can I ever be sure I exist?However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someoneinsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would bepointless - the being would exist anyway.Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does notexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This beingis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but letus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivitypostulate). The question "why anything exists" can be countered bydemanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness,or in non-existence". Actually, both questions turn out to bedevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't existdon't exist. Tautology at its best.I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God isHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with thisanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God isactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us andthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does GodHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, alwaysexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapableof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do notaccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt thequestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists havesuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emergefrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recentHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are moreappropriate for discussions like this. : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isn't: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how",not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why"questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that thesupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it isas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. : I believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems aresomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christiansin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announcethey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolutioncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, althoughtheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent bookSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. JonathanCape, London 1992.Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do notviolate any physical laws as we know them. : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you: really have nothing to worry about, eh?Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelicalatheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I wouldnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

There is a difference between calling>evolution a fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing>facts (I happen to think the latter is more accurate ).I hate doing this, because it's been done so many times before, but...Evolution, in the nonscientific sense, is change.  Although it isoften used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tendtoward higher complexity and ability, evolution simply implies change,for good or for bad.  In the scientific sense, evolution is merely thechange in allele frequencies for a given population over a period oftime.  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss thescientific fact of evolution.  We observe such shifts in allelefrequencies occurring all the time, so it is trivial to conclude thatevolution is a scientific fact.The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies arecollectively known as the theory of evolution.  Darwin's naturalselection is one such theory.  Genetic drift is another.  Gene flow isstill another.Evolution is a fact and a theory.

The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that.You would have to include the statement within a syllogism andassert the rationility of the syllogism.A statement is just a statement.  As to its objectivity - well it depends what you mean.Values tend to be regarded as good or bad, valid or invalid, true or false,and so on.  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other ofthose options for all people - or, if you are prepared for dissent, thenthey are those values which should be accepted by everyone.If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'.Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad, or atleast right versus wrong (or even just correct versus incorrect) anda way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour.In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort.Suppose you could predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americansbelieved that something is better than nothing.You could usefully say that the existence of that value was anobjective fact.  You could not say that the value itself wasobjective.   You could not do that unless you could prove that thevalue was 'right'.  Showing that everyone happens to accept the valueas right doesn't show that it is right.>Do you agree with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" >is false?Well I am a believer in a God.  So I do believe that some values areobjective.  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to t.abecause it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mindof many t.a readers.So, ignoring the idea of a God, I disagree with you.I believe, in this limited context, that 'no values are objective'.But I think that this thread is showing some cross-purpose debate.I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' whenrelating it to values.

They are extremely usefulmathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, isvery much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but wehave a very useful model that describes much of the behavior onobjects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was asimple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly the way the theory now formulated talks about it.

That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is *not* relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can predict this, which sounds pretty objective to me.-- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you look at an iguana.

"Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. #They are not the same thing at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is #an accuracy judgement again, I'm afraid.) This is the root of the problem: I bloomin' well amn't punning on theword value!!!  I know it's ambiguous.  I've told you the sense inwhich I'm using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN'T meanaccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,is not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of'value'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  I can only understand that by '"useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in makingthat conclusion or not.   That's part of what I mean by objectivevaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn't value x for the purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn't really do that. Therest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own freedom) are solid facts in themselves.Consider each of the following statements:(1) The only reason that the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  (2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of peoplefinds the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' useful indealing with phenomena.(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful inmodelling phenomena.Where is the 'pun' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  And what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that "the basis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. 'subjective' values"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a 'subjective' value judgement?  (an 'accurate' value judgement, maybe?)Just to illustrate what I mean: what's the difference between saying'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we haveto model phenomena' and (say) 'Love and intelligence are the best tools we haveto achieve freedom'?  Is one 'objective', the other not?  Both are judgements about value ("best"), and both have the same empirical basis, from where _I_ sit.#Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based#on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.I'm afraid I do mean to say that it's based on "goodness" judgements."Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate predictions" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.  A relativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of "science", or of a given scientist - but it seems pretty solid and objective to me.-- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

Do you claimto have an objective one?  I'll assume your answer is "yes," apologiesif not."Objective" means is that different observers will get the same results.The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system.  I'd beinterested in seeing a summary of your system, though I appreciate thatit might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing.In your post above you objected to "situational morals."  Perhaps youcould begin by explaining how you objectively set the situationalboundaries of an act, in your system.  I don't think you can do it.Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point.  I think ofa situation, and you have to say whether it is moral or not, and why.In your move you can1) Ask me any objective question about the situation, or2) Pronounce judgement.After you have pronounced judgement, I get to add whatever context I liketo the situation, provided I don't change anything I have already said.If I can change the context to one where your objective system would givea different answer, then your system is faulty.  (Since I don't know whatyour system is, either you must write it down, or at least be consistent.)Do you think your system could pass this test?-Norman

None of this is intended as a flame. To say thatyou don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot.

In other words, wheredo you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean thatall of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationismis a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especiallyspeculative, in which case I have merely misinterpretedyou.

It should be clear from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against themessiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate themessiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It flatly states Jesus "was the Christ", and mentions the crucifixion, resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - "... brother ofJesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]", and that's it. If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out ofcontext, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistentwith the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as inElaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), "A comment *attributed* to Josephusreports ....[emphasis mine]".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in alegal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes itdifficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easilydisguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,please let me know.  As for its "much less gung-ho" tone, obviously the date of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu of removal can be easily explained.*<(:-)Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality.Suppose X-ist saucers land.  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo"666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the humanspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?2) Science cannot explain origins.This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It dependson what origins we are talking about.3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of originsis to say that there is no higher truth than science.Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of "highertruth" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are waysto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they evenbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Manybelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the languageof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither "higher" or "lower"; they are simply true.More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to sciencedoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts thescope of discussion.4) This is a false premise.If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was falsethen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as anotherfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.5) By the way, I enjoy science.On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of scienceto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well saythat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.Let us not quibble; count this one as true.7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percentreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out truewith the following contextual modification:"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percentof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent ofwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion."-----It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touchon truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I dohim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to hispersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis thathe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.-- Richard Harter: SMDS Inc.

I realize it is > normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what> are the other reasons?Far from being "tossed out," the gospels are taken, almostuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who "tosses out"the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobbascribes this more broadly.Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter iswhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, faroutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels*not* taken as "gospel truth" that faithfully records just whathappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, andthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is takenthis way by a critical reader.There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms thetext as "historically valid" or "tosses out" the text.  I suspectthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary andsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to presenthistorical arguments along these lines for their religiousprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondaryschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the bettersuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibedabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument ifit bit him on the keister twice.Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of textsand their use in studying history.  First, all texts arehistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, Ihave never seen a notion of "historical validity" that makes anysense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read astelling the "gospel truth" about historical events, in the waythat many students are wont to read history texts in primary andsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favoriteauthor's history of whatever.)Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by someperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, everytext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what canwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) doesthe text provide evidence?The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly ofOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historicalevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  Themodern American history textbooks that whitewash "great Americanfigures" are historical evidence.  These are all historicalevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at allthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; thatJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "greatAmerican figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.They are better evidence that some people "saw" the Maharishi,late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christiansthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe"saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have aneducational system that largely prefers to spread myth ratherthan teach history.How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece ofhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is avery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.There are many books on the subject or various parts of thesubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's "Historian's Fallacies"as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easyto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easyto read.  Give it a try.Russell

Theymake reference to several scandals that occurred long before "the night of thelong knives". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions ofthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose nameescapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehmand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do nothave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty ofdocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of thelong knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleepingtogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA'shomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. >(Irving, a>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely doyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I haveread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. >I challenge anyone to document this claim.If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out wherethe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close toarchival material - most people on the net are not.>I *have* found a great>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, sothat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazismight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this istrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis werehomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notoriousfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the Germangovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friendswere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a longtradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like theEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. TheHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof youwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modernhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing isstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you proveotherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.                                                                           /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/David Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softlyof us in days hereafter..."

Does flibozity exist?By "flibozity", I mean a particular, extremely complex configuration of physical phenomena, which no-one, absolutely NO-ONE cares about in the slightest. Does it exist, Eric?Getting back to the question of whether the DES chip "works", doesn't "work" mean something like "achieving the desired/expected effect"? Note the way intentionality subtly underlies that definition. Even if we take the definition as "expected", instead of "desired", can you deny that conformance to expectations is itself a value of sorts, namely the scientific values of accuracy-of-prediction and reproducibility-of-results?The phenomenologist Husserl, for one, considered Intentionality to be theprimary ontological "stuff" from which all other ontology was built --perceptions, consciousness, thoughts, etc. Frank is by no means alone inseeing intentionality (or "values", as he puts it) underlying all humanexperience, even the so-called "objective" experiences, such as measurements of the natural world, or the output of your DES chip.- Kevin

Bruce hits the main point simply -- as Russell Turpin does in more detailin his response.  *All* sources are, in modern historiography, to be usedcritically, which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them aresubject to *specific* examination in the light of motives and other HUMANconsiderations (as well as the physical background).  The critical methodapplies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others(most emphatically *including* the historical researchers themselves.)>wouldn't they be a better "reporter" than someone who heard about it second >hand?  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.  I know, there is bias,>and winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best>still apply?But given the critical principle, what evidence is there that we haveANYTHING at ALL from "firsthand" sources about Jesus?  Paul's letters areindeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions.  They are, asa result, the most historically solid books in the NT.  Paul's claims anddescriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be "wie es eigent-lich gewesen" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant!In other words, we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we wouldthe testimony of a witness in court.The gospels are another story altogether.  Luke is most assuredly NOT afirsthand witness.  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closerto the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient booksand Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in hisbook(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke.  Johnhas a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloveddisciple (who is NOT named.)  We are not bound to accept this claim (fora long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, itmakes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  Neither Marknor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  Later (much later) Christiantradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaicproto-gospel, and associates Mark with Peter as having something like thesame second-hand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel.Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate theactual data before us.  Luke and Matthew both appear to use (differently!)an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words anddeeds) of Jesus, as well as to be dependent on Mark.  This makes theirtestimony AT LEAST thirdhand.All that said, historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from theNT sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources foranything about the earliest Church.  They are also *extremely* importantfor the light they cast (however refracted through Christian biases) onthe sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of thedestruction of the 2nd Temple.The problem of "the historical Jesus" is tricky, however.  There is acycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major "high" in peoplethinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some-thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT.  The difficulty here(which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favorin another generation :-)) was pointed out by Bultmann, after Schweitzer'streatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simplyBECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quiteanonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church, we have no easy and reliableway to distribute ANY part of the material between "real" history and theinventions of the Church.  There are few "radical skeptics" who think wehave nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can bemaintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish "shaping"of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to "invention."--Michael L.

See the difference?Just for the record ( not that any kind of information would belikely to affect your thinking ) I have an MSEE -- focus inElectromagnetics -- from Penn.A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make.What was observed is something we can measure that matches what the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted.  Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and awave model for light, the atomic model is a mathematicalrepresentation of physical phenomena.  A model that can andprobably will continue to change over time.  That makes it subjective (the model that is).  However, the model gives us anobjective way to talk about the physical world.To put it another way, the Quantum Mechanical model of the atomallows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable andunambiguous results, which is objective.  However, as Bohr andEinstein duked it out mid-century, the interpretation ofthose reapeatable, observable measurements is quite subjective.Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion wasinherent in the nature of the universe.  Einstein said particlemotion was deterministic, but it was our measurement shortcomingsthat introduced the randomness.  They were talking about theEXACT same results, though.-jim halat

So long as it accurately predicts or describes things we can observe.Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don'tjust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolutionis still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got startedbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact ofevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.>>[description of atomic theory, and alternative theories of gravity, deleted]>>Both are very useful models that >>have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you >>want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly >>the way the theory now formulated talks about it.>>Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.

Again, it may be because I feel strongerabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselvesare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enoughto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational        evidence (your way)   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn'tmuch to say.Do you agree?--  jim halat         halat@bear.com     bear-stearns       --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you--   nyc             i speak only for myself

Being able to distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man of peace does not mean that you have a method for tellingwho's a terrorist in general.Of course we *try* to tell them apart, but for my moneyit's better to try with the full awareness that we allbring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we areusing some objective test.jon.

It'sobvious from even a cursory study of history that no system,regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis, will makepeople act any better. Until human nature changes, the products of ournature won't change, and that has to include society. I think yourassessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic.   What is needed is an absolute moral standard if -all- people are tocreate any Utopias. By implying a Utopian future, you also argue foran absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case.

The appearance that there is onecomes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly(physically) in this geometry, rather analogous to the "singularity" atthe North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitudelines.  Such "singular" behavior as the earlier post suggested (infinitetime to reach the horizon) is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choiceof coordinates.  As Paul says, in the object's frame of reference,it WILL hit the horizon in finite time, and then plunge to the singularity(that IS a "real" singularity) in a (short, for "small" holes) further finite amount of time.Not only that, but to an OUTSIDE observer, an object that falls into a blackhole disappears in a finite time also, in spite of the relativistic "slow-down" that intuition suggests.  This is because any light emitted by theobject as it falls (or is shone onto it by a separate "flashlight") consistsof individual, FINITE quanta, and only a finite number of these can reachthe object before it plunges through the horizon.  These will be succesivelymore red-shifted, true, but only a finite number of them will hit the object,and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they,too, are inside the horizon (and thus cannot come out).This reddening, dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast, as the object approaches the horizon, when you do the math.As Paul says, this is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's book "Gravity" where they talk about the appropriatness (sp?) of the term "black hole" and the inappropriatness (sp?) of an older term: "frozen star", which was used earlier in this century before all the implications of black-hole theory were understood.  Do not let the math deter you from looking at this book; it's got a lot of good prose discussions of this material, in between the equations, that is VERY good reading, IMHO.Of course, it's all just THEORY... :-)> > |  __L__> >-|-  ___  Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub> > |  | o | kv07@iastate.edu> > |/ `---' Iowa State University> >/|   ___  Math Department> > |  |___| 400 Carver Hall> > |  |___| Ames, IA  50011> > J  _____> --> --------> Paul J.

So, here are some references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where Lane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' career] is agreed to be a Christian addition."In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  "A comment *attributed* toJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]".  Scholars sometimes do not even mentionthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about thelong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus areorginally developed (does anyone?).Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  Theformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological andideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled toincorporate theology).Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.:-)Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen againand be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict: the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reactionrepeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted: it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,: strictly speaking, are lacking.: -- Can't resist, because I've thought about it...Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis.There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied forthe theory to be accurate, such as the hotly discussed topic ofstereoisomerism.  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice (forall the wonder that would engender!), because for the theory ofabiogenesis to be accurate, the life would have to resemble the bestidea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled.Comes down to that old question "Can we ever really be sure?"But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had beendemonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed onprimordial Earth, I would look for the following:1)  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earthenvironment;2)  ALL contamination sources were eliminated;3)  The lifeform produced resembles primitive/simple Earthlifeforms;4)  The theory accounts for differences in the modernEarth environment and primitive Earth environment.NOW, if those criteria were satisfied, Dr. Abio, who performed theexperiment, would then be in possession of the best candidate fora theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth.  At which point Dr.BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspectof the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment, ora characteristic of the new "lifeform" that doesn't resemble lifeon Earth.  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate thediscrepancies, and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims,Dr. BBio would then have the best theory.Never provable;  constantly modifiable;  progressing evercloser to the "correct" answer, until the evidence is overwhelming(and even when it is, a theory that explains even MORE may take itsplace) ------- that's a scientific theory.===========================================================|  James G.

Can he be impartial     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or     will he assume the superstition of his parents     when questioning? I've often found it to be the case that the theist     will stick to some kind of superstition when     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,     and the other theists alike.  All assume that     their mothers and fathers were right in the     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief     search for their god.     Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or     aspects of the same religion, but overall the     majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"     was behind the universe's existence.  I've     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice     versa, I've known Christians who were once     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout     their transition from one faith to another,     they've kept this belief in some form of higher     "being."  Why?     It usually all has to do with how the child is     brought up.  From the time he is born, the     theist is brought up with the notion of the     "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.     He is also told that to question this (as     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.     Thus, by the time he is able to read the     scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a     matter of course.     But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to     inculcate the child the "right" readings of     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to     explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."     Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and     "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath     of some sort, and the child must learn to put     away his brain when the matter concerns God.     All of this has some considerable effect on the     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the      superstitions he's been taught are nearly     impossible to remove.     All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that     God *does* exist and look at everything from     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most     theists can somewhat, especially when presented     with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption     of God's existence and question it impartially?

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argumentfrom article length."  And the list you have here is of poorerquality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from anon-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem withverses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none whodenied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many ofthe contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls inone verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort ofcontradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in myexperience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount toanything more than attacking a straw man?Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes outof context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the onesthat are genuine contradictions need to have more said aboutthem than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effortshould be made to understand and respond to the common repliesgiven by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that DaveButler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list thatwould have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documentedcontradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken outof context and thrown together in a list.)Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together tomake a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us whowant to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thingas embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.djP.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The qualityis very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just acompilation of things many people have written), but some ofit would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, Imight be willing to help put it together.

I wish that the semi-explicit linking of evolution to so-called "rational"atheism could be avoided; it just gives the creationists fuel for theiroften-repeated incantation that "evolution leads to atheism."  -- Dave--   *-------------------------------------------------------------*  * David Knapp        dk@imager.llnl.gov       (510) 422-1023  *  *            98.7% of all statistics are made up.             *  *-------------------------------------------------------------*

They aren't even real.  What scientists callan atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  Allof which is subjective.  What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist takes in discussing his model and his observations.  Thereis no objective science.  But there is an objective approachwhich is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objectivein this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules thathe and his colleagues use to discuss their science.This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be anobjective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs onmorality.  But there exists no objective morality.Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussionis objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimesof what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss oursurroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is whatwe can _say_ about the physical world.-jim halat

There are people who convert fromnon-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (Idon't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be aninteresting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People arenaturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't wantto believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there isnothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (thingsscience has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling ofsecurity... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  Thishas a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and thesepeople are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in theirbelief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind ofuseless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy withtheir fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather acceptthe harsh reality that they are running from).Anyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theismdoesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to growup as a theist (although this happens far too often).

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a redherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was thatHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuseofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your factsright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA ina coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations ofhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (itis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubtit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that hisformer right hand man was a homosexual?). Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 1920's.>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered>tainted evidence. Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell theparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know what tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in time and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matterdo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better>place when they departed, This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feelingseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that thismust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is whatlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But thisis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors andtracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not myspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that wouldcast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my timetrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.>but concrete particulars are still no more than>more or less shrewd guesses.  >-- Diccon FrankbornGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth wouldconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars beenconsidered "shrewd guesses"?I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

It is simple; I believe that the odds againstthere being only one universe and that universe having the right conditionsto support us are infinate. I believe that to explain our existance inthis universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes(an infinate number of them) or intelligent design. Since the onlyintelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter(the brain is made of matter) by Ockham's razor I go for the firstchoice.What's more, there are a couple of books out dealing with popularscience that use parallel universes and holographic universes (whichis another way of saying parallel) to explain the behavior of particalsat the quantum level. One is called Parallel Universes, and I think itis by Wolf, the other The Holographic Universe.BTW, the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in thevery physical reality of the universe. >Bruce Salem>eric

Considering: the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.: So, back to the original question:: And objective morality is.....?This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.Objective in the sense used here means something immutable andabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group ofpeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. Theconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), thenHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; Hisexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If thisbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He hasdefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsicallyself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in anobjective sense.If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to thatstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relativemorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending tomisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required tomeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality isinfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itselfdoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a culturalnorm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seemsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our truenature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as beingcontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due asBillmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like itor not, it's there.x

Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in?When I have no good idea of what this being is like, only some contradictory statements being made by various religions, I cannot firmly assert anything specific. A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist.However, we will first need a definition of 'god', and the theisticreligions do not agree very well on this. Did you see my earlierposting on the existence of god? Theists cannot even agree whetherany god exists, or meta-exists, or is herself the existence. Omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience are other conceptstheists do not all agree upon. Thus, it is hard to assert anythingabout a such fluxional beings. _Deus absconditus_ remains hidden,from those who believe and from those who don't. > That's where weak atheism draws its strength.  But its> strength is also its Achilles' heel.  Without assertions/axioms, one> has no foundation upon which to build.  As a philosophy, it's virtually> worthless.  IMO, of course.I have to disagree here - first, philosophical maxims are not necessarilysomething to build upon. What can I build upon Occam's Razor, for instance? Weak atheism is not a _philosophy_ (a philosophical system).There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from,ranging from reductionism (my choice) to objectivism. Actually,philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of god/s.Second, your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me, and is actually a versionof the oft-heard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place theirfaith on _something_, even if it is not god_'. This has been discussed inthe FAQ, but from a different viewpoint, and I do not repeat it.I think one does not have to take _anything_ on blind faith.True, one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer;to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all, however. It isprobably the simplest assumption one can make (after solipsism,of course).  Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

An awful lot of thestarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economicpolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typicalWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terriblemalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it canbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  Theyhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loanswe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarreidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic againstWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the childrenare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for thesupposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives byfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting againstabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save moreof those by fighting for human rights in China.And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack thisethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatoryforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.mathew

Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allowhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, Isuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers fromall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to anyconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from myperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right tolife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do whatthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve infavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromisesolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, anddeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  Thisis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their owndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happywith current UK abortion law.Similarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, andI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't evenknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.mathew

Wrong!In philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons forhis believing so, not the negative.  If I were to make the statement elves exist, then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion, not the person saying that elves don't exist.  If the negative in this case had to prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of theuniverse.  The same applies with god.

[deletions]Jim - we essentially agree, except about the definition of "fact."The scientific definition of "fact" is not "the ultimate truth," butrather "a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictivethat it is pointless to test it anymore."So, we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution(just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity, andthe fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory).  The factof evolution is that the current diversity of life arose throughcommon descent:  this is so supported by the evidence that no one everbothers to try to test it anymore.  Theories of evolution includetheories regarding the mechanism of common descent (natural selectionvs. drift) or the actual "pathways" of evolution, or any number ofother things.  These are constantly being tested, because the actualmechanisms, etc, behind the fact of common descent are still up forquestion.Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  In other words, itcould, theoretically, still be falsified and rejected.  But since it'sso predictive, and so consistently supported by evidence, it seemspointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore.[description of atomic theory, and alternative theories of gravity, deleted]>Both are very useful models that >have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you >want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly >the way the theory now formulated talks about it.Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea.Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absoluteknowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absoluteknowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that?If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, andin it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets,no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals,then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word ofGod, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation whichinvariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do youknow that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and thatyou do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals.The only way you can assert such things is through appeal toprejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a groupyou have aligned yourself to.>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? Because social pressure is the most powerful force known toman. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness ofestablished religion is anything other than social convention? Oneway is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is notthe same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origento trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties.>What right do>we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise eachgeneration with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakeswe have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checksall tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In factauthority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to thinkthat they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religiousauthority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than otherpower structures on this score and it seems that because there are nochecks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abusesrecorded by history are greater.We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting inthe home. This does not come from books or authority figures insoceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it isnot because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by somemysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulaswill repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need tolook at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happenin our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primarymeans we have to teach children values. Of course people are tryingto have the community do things that once were done in the familyalone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this.>Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say> that I was >exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want>anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazyman from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. Itmay help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but itmay not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy peoplefrom murduring.It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianismis in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhatisolated, that do not experience change, and have long standingtraditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisionspeople have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to nothave to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes aproblem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals arenot sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that thereare values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outsidepolitical, economic, technical, and cultural influiences.Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like youwith great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse "forthe children.". I think that such people are more of an imparative towant to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits,such as of the truth.Bruce Salem
