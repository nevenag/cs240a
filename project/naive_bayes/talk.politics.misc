Why are you holding>the "Branch Davidian" to a higher standard than the Jews?Although I can understand why you think the comparison might be valid,I would have to disagree. The Jews who found themselves alone againstRome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the onefaced by the Branch Davidians. The latter, in reality, would likelyhave been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely. It is highlyunlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been beenimprisoned for very long. But regardless, most of the people, andcertainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and ifthey so chose, join another cult.The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what hadalready happened. Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age wouldprobably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women andchildren would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likelyto practice their religion again.I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that thefate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they werefighting for religious freedom. I guest that's a judgement call...-- ________________________________________Jack F. Love| Opinions expressed are mine alone.|(Unless you happen to agree.)
 48Greetings,    Specious reasoning alert!  Sorry folks, I don't like gun controltoo much, but this is just too crazy.    1)  The main gun control law is similar to (or even BASED ON) aGerman gun control law.    2)  Germany was Controlled With Evil Nazi's at the time.    3)  Nazi's are bad.    Therefore gun control is bad!  (If this seems reasonable to you,try reading it as GunControlIsANaziPlot!  That's pretty much what it'ssaying.)    Look, let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense, not bytrying to appeal to emotions, and threatening conspiracies.  DenounceGCA '68 as wrong because it's WRONG, not because it's based off of alaw from someone else's government.    As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's, So Their LawsHave No Place On Our Books!'  Well, lots of brave men died fightingEngland.  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books?  Oh,but they're our ALLIES now, so everything's hunky-dory.  I'm *VERY*sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books whichis similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  HOWEVER,that does not give invalidation in and of itself.    WE, THE PEOPLE, must state that we find the law unappealing andcontrary to our freedom.  We must use logic, and reason, and compellingarguments.  To use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselvesto the level of your enemies.    A side issue...  When talking about the Amendments, it bothersme to see people acting as if they empower them, but require noresponsibility from them.  Free speech also assumes restraint, wellarmed militia expects well TRAINED militia, the right to vote expectsthe citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonabledecision.  You are not granted these rights without any responsibilityto the society that offers them.  You have a responsibility in return,and it's to do more than bitch.                                                     --  Morgan Schweers-- Hacker, Furry, SFFan, gamer, writer, MUDder, climber.  24 hours isn't enough!mrs@netcom.com   | Finger mrs@netcom.com or mrs@mcafee.com for my PGP 2.1 key!|New chrome grass! \\ B1 S4 a b g j++! k l? p r- s t+ u v- w+ x y- z, approx.__/Low-level D&D monsters practicing war games @ night.

You'd have to be very unfamiliar with US history to   think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in   in 1932.  The police could generally get away with a lot more  in those days, there were few citizens and media "watchdog"   organizations, no "Miranda" rulings, and women, blacks, gays,  and other such groups had very few right indeed.  Moreover  censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant  at that time (think about "banned in Boston" or the Hays  Commission).    My comments were directed against those who see these sorts  of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to   vanish.---peter

Each side is committed to overstating the problem it addresses.  For the procontrol forces, that problem is the contribution of guns to violence and crime, while for the anticontrol forces, that problem is the procontrol forces...  Each set of advocacy group serves as the demon by which the other side can rally the troops, raising morale and money.  The public is not enlightened by this war of words because neither set of advocates has any stake in merely presenting the plain, unvarnished truth, even to the extent that flawed and biased human minds can understand it.  Quite the contrary -- to tell the truth and nothing but the truth would place one side at a distinct disadvantage if the other side did not also lay down their propaganda weapons."

Unfortunately, the states relinquished their own, independent militia units to the National Guard -- which can be "federalized" into Army service by the President at any time -- in their hunger for federalfunds.  And it was the STATES -- not the gun owners -- who passed laws against "private citizens engaging in martial drill."So, many gun owners train to the remaining lawful limit, which trainingis almost exclusively administered by the NRA -- not the states, notthe feds.  So don't lecture us on responsibility.-- cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet...

 105Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-SovietArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

Was it not a state?Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areasin which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changedhowever and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state hadthe capacity to change the constitution to enable this.The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictatethe manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can preventabuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidatefor opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful armscontrol measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who couldprevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the powerof the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. Thisis the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern becausethe people with the guns think that they have the right to decide thelaw.|>>You have a very confused notion of what a state is.

But|>saying that "a state is a governing body" does not mean that it is|>the only sort of a governing body, unless one plays semantic games|>like, "if a state didn't create it, it's not really a law".The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is whichdate from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countrieswere much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisationswhere individual members had significant powers in their own right anddid not derive their power from a central authority.|> The|>canonical example of non-governmental law is probably the Law|>Merchant, which others can expound upon better than I.  But it was|>certainly enforced in non-state courts for some time, although state|>courts, being subsidized, later were able to effectively enter the|>arbitration business.But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rulesand regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectivelymade in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which isa non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so howeverwithin the framework laid down by the government.In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. Ifyou were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw themonarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very shorttime. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit RoyalCharters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authorityto be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case ofmisbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to removeprivillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently establishedthrough a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favourswithout recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolishthe house of lords for example.Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the "common law" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is lawmade by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else iscommon law.Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. Forexample a judgment in common law made in England can effect the interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once inthe Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example alot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevanceto UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning thatlies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus ifa judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law inone jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with noguiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime whichthey might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The lawshould be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions withoutprecedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is superior in UK law.Phill Hallam-Baker.

We have the world's best medical care; let's not>mess it up with Hillary Clinton's plans for socialized medicine.">>>John F. McManus, National President of the John Birch Society>When McManus says, "We have the world's best medical care," I can hardlybelieve he's referring to a system:1.  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than    10 percent.2.  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.3.  Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life    expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many    preventable diseases.4.  We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs.  (To put that in    perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.)5.  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on    health benefits.  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere    else.How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The onlything the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patientswith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  Andthe "private" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficientthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from everyother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.Of the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of healthcare costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billionwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests andprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.There are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.  But did the"private competition" stimulate more efficient paperwork?  Ask any doctorwho's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all!The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down.  Thecompetition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged thehospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment.  Spending millions onexpensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idleisn't my idea of the world's best health care system.Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous andexpensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful.  I'm especiallythinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy andCesarean section.  Sound like the world's best health care system?Ever notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change inhealth care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system?  First of all, HillaryClinton is not advocating another Canadian system.  I think that's been madeabundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months.  Where did John F.McManus get that idea, anyway?Let's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border.  Yourchild needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals.  Thenearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's anAmerican city one hour south.  Which way are you going to go?  Is it becausethe American system is the "best" in the world, or just for convenience?It still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black andwhite on health care reform.  There are a million different ways we ouldrestructure the system.  It's not just a choice between total governmentcontrol and total private control.  I wish the people screaming "socializedmedicine" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORMTHEMSELVES on health care issues.The current system sucks.  I want to keep providers private but that doesn'tchange the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if wedon't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  Purely private health care without anygovernment intervention doesn't work.  Hillary Clinton is not thinking ofnationalizing providers or evern insurers.  How can you scream "socializedmedicine" at her programs?  Don't you even know what you're talking about?Ever see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of thedecade?  Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing?  Why?  I'll giveyou one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if wedon't do something about it.PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.  The current health care system is a cancer which iskilling our economic well-being.  Costs are still rising 10 percent a yeareven as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced intomanaged-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if youask me.A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to pleasecome forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would setabout keeping costs down.  I didn't get a single answer.The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releasesfilled with evasive platitudes like "give health care back to the people."Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms?  What is it about thecurrent system that you would change and how would that help?How can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults?How can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, ourinfrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwingaway money which could be used to SOLVE those problems?America needs health care reform NOW.

 9Message-ID: <1rbh6h$b25@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: thor.ins.cwru.edu   The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaustis insulting and completely false.  Any person making such a rudeand false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust, or alsoignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.   To compare a complicated political situation with the genocideof 6,000,000 Jews is racist in and of itself.

Doublejeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive forceor assault.

For example, Article IV:"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not beviolated"; Article V: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital,or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment bya Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,or property, without due process of law"; Article VIII: "excessive bailshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusualpunishments inflicted".Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?Whether slaves were considered "not human" I don't know, but it seemsthat a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as definedin the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on theDeclaration of Independence which states that "all Men are created equal,that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness",it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definitionof humanity.-----Eric Smitherics@netcom.comerics@infoserv.comCI$: 70262,3610

 28OK Phil, you're right. So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victimof overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob witha dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?Unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation'scitizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon'stapes. What's on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded thatthere is "evidence" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including GeorgeBush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.Ask your local D.A. what the charges are for the above crime.And so I must ask you, Phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes outwhen you and I are old men, I would appreciate the privilege of sticking a poleup your ass and parading you down Main Street with a sign on your chest:"I was an Apologist for the American Fascist Regime circa 1944 -- 2010"(How's that for a lovely Brecht-ian image:-)There, that ought to get a reaction.

Otherwise, back to your own league, son.  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  ThisAndi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yetbecause he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, youattack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi'squestion in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The onlyones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with factare the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having someINTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!{assuming you are also semitic}Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorismduring the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out ofPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form ofterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by theArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent Britishsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were infavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, theymassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributingto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared theirvery lives.I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm partJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of theIsraelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of thePalestinians because they were indeed screwed over by theJews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay forGerman and European anti semitism.Pissed off at Immature,                          Closeminded, Self righteousSemites

 75       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate    points.    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:    - It was alleged that:" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. "!    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives     of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology    in Iran after revolution.    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million    dead left from the war.    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: " It hurts me to    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda." The     translator says: " It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly     research."!    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to     undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of     Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones    in scientific and industrial efforts.    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from    Iran's different sites. They say: "We are not sure if the places visited    by IAEA are the real ones or not" !, or " We can not rely on IAEA's    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear    activities before" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build    nuclear weapons!    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking    from the absolute knowledge!       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.Mohammad      [*] International Atomic Energy Agency

Even on a twenty year old car there is a bigdifference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to beredone and a concours classic. I got mine for 600 quid because it wasin a shitty state from bad repairs. If it had been well repaired it wouldbe worth a hell of a lot more.Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up forinfringing copyright on parts they don't make? I find that very hard tobeleive. In the UK they are very sympathetic - Ford recently dug outthe Cortina Mk I body press so that some company could make a few more.BL does amazing stuff, they kept the entire assembly line for the MGsand helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells.There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off.The former I can't see anyone trying to stop.

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and amdisturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in thismanner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided healthcoverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may losenot only my coverage but even my job.I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that healthinsurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory intheir health insurance program, so that it can be declined, withan appropriate reduction in premium.In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in thehealth benefit packages between those who would choose to haveabortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that youinclude a provision in which the reduction in premium resultingfrom the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to theemployee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  This second provision should serve to dissuade employers frompressuring employees into taking one or the other stand withregard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.  Your fellowcitizen.                                   Sincerely,----------------------------------------------------------------

Some more details would be appreciated.Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of thedetails that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controlswere working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the fedsdid something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bushand the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replacedGrahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spendingincreases.As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the capson spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act asPresident (so that he could create his own new plan with more taxincreases).The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.Chew on that awhile.

The latter, in reality, would likelyhave been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely.

Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age wouldprobably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women andchildren would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likelyto practice their religion again.I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that thefate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they werefighting for religious freedom.

 31From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich)-BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic)-----d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com-   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich callinghimself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs firstin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal termbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotationsare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion theeightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholarMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then theNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' issynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people whooriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghansand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the wordby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, isnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claimto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``Insearch of the Indo-Europeans" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literatureas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans andfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horriblethings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans haveno clear claim.Rohit Parikh

 94  Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato  Institute points out.    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as  dramatically.    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group  of Seven nations.    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the  overall U.S. economy.    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not  reduce demand.    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state  at the expense of the individual.    "Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no.  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.Available from:  Cato Institute  224 Second Street SE  Washington, DC  20003---------------------------------------------------------------------------                        The Cato Institute    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the  traditional American principles of limited government, individual  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in   questions of policy and the proper role of government.    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation  of the American Revolution.    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for  civil liberties.    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue  Code.  The Cato Institute  224 Second Street S.E.  Washington, DC  20003

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what thewriter is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up whathe says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.(For example, "Simon Zealotes" = the certain apostle having a nicknameconnected to a Jewish terrorist group)Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference toChristians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the JewishChristian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time torecord the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of thefate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learnnothing from Josephus.Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong inthe process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunityto learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor underDomitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christiansin either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective asstated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspectsof "cult psychology" are to be found there. I can think of a thing or two offhand, but I'd like to give Mr. Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his ownknowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.Bill R.--"The only proposals in the Senate that I         "My opinions do not representhave seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer orpraiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency."It seems to me that the historian's foremost     - Bill Riggsduty is to ensure that virtue is remembered,and to deter evil words and deeds with thefear of posterity's damnation."- Tacitus, _Annals_ III. 65

 22Would someone be kind enought to document the exactnature of the evidence against the BD's without reference tohearsay or newsreports. I would also like to know more abouttheir past record etc. but again based on solid not mediareports. My reason for asking for such evidence is that last nighton Larry King Live a so-called "cult-expert" was interviewed fromAustralia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to theoriginal raid. This admission, if true, raises the nastypossibility that the Government acted in good faith, which Ibelieve they did, on faulty evidence. It also raises thepossibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advisingthem and giving ver poor advice.A few years ago Anson Shupe and David Bromley publishedSTRANGE GODS: THE GREAT AMERICAN CULT SCARE (Beacon, Boston, 1981- and THE NEW VIGILANTES: ANTI-CULTISTS AND NEW RELIGIONS -Sage,Beverly Hills, 1980. Both books suggested the possibility oftragic results if self-proclaimed cult experts were ever takenseriously. Perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movementneeds investigating in light of the Waco tragedy.
 5What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum?  It is the home of the muslim as well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitzak Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so therefore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does.

However, assuming your implication to be more-or-lesscorrect, your final result is still invalid.  If 50% of *all* maleshave had more than 7.3 partners, and you deduct the assumed 1% of homosexual males, what remains is not 49.5%, but still *50%* of all*heterosexual* males.

I just happen to believethat everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies.They're all human beings, not some nest of wasps thatyou're trying to exterminate.The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handledthe original raid.  It was well known that Koresh regularlywent jogging outside his property.  He could have been servedwith a search warrant then.  He could have been arrested ifhe had refused to comply.  Instead officers armed with grenadesinvaded the property.  This escalated into a shooting warwith tragic deaths on both sides.Those were the first two mistakes:  the bad judgment ofasking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probablyillegal way the already-unwise warrant was served.At this point, the situation escalated to where it wasdescribed as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.That's when the government started covering their traces,sealing the warrant, revising their reported history ofthe incident, etc.Things were already building up to disaster.  Now thegovernment could have simply closed the supply routesand waited.  But according to Janet Reno, that optionhad "never been seriously considered".  So, supposedlybecause the agents were "frustrated and fatigued", andbecause there supposedly were no backups, they feltthey had to go in.Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsiblefor the fire.  If that's so, he deserves the blamefor the deaths of the people in his compound.But the government's hands are far from clean.Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment pluscontempt for the 4th amendment.  The motivationsfor the second raid are just too unbelievable.And their coverup of the events of the firstraid undermines their credibility in anythingthey do thereafter.  We have only some verybiased FBI agents' word for what happened.And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gundiscussion.  Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-ownersdeserve to get frontally assaulted by armed governmentagents.  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether hisguns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal,or whatever! -- Rob Strom, strom@watson.ibm.com, (914) 784-7641IBM Research, 30 Saw Mill River Road, P.O.

There is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas.  Tear gas is non-breathable    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually    by siezures and death.  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people    they exposed??  Any potential heart problems among the B-D's??2.  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister??  Tear gas is produced by burning a    chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a     warning printed on the side of it.  "Contact with flamable material can result    in fire."  Now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building     they admited was a fire-trap??This whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are heldaccountable.

Each side is committed to overstating the problem it addresses.  For the procontrol forces, that problem is the contribution of guns to violence and crime, while for the anticontrol forces, that problem is the procontrol forces...  Each set of advocacy group serves as the demon by which the other side can rally the troops, raising morale and money.  The public is not enlightened by this war of words because neither set of advocates has any stake in merely presenting the plain, unvarnished truth, even to the extent that flawed and biased human minds can understand it.

And it was the STATES -- not the gun owners -- who passed laws against "private citizens engaging in martial drill."So, many gun owners train to the remaining lawful limit, which trainingis almost exclusively administered by the NRA -- not the states, notthe feds.

For certain anthropologicalresearches - I already reported to the Reichsfuehrer-SS onthem - 150 skeletons of prisoners, or rather Jews, arerequired, which are to be supplied by the KL Auschwitz.However, the good Doctor needed some more items to complete hisresearch:Testimony of Magnus Wochner, SS guard at the Natzweiler ConcentrationCamp["The Natzweiler Trial", Edited by Anthony M.

In this case thecorpses were sent to Professor Hirt of the department of Anatomy inStrasbourg.-Danny Keren.

I do not normally read t.p.m.,and I posted my request for references because Jim's articlewas cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewishdisrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions areone of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, andrumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogromsthan blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture createcognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore anyclaim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated bydecent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it hasnot been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should begiven the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has beendocumented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting andshameful. Especially so because the official who failed toprovide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanianswas probably Jewish, and as a Jew I know that he should haveknown better.Adam_V_Reed@ATT.com

Oh great.  Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting  each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes  as "out of control" and atrocities being reported from both sides.  These people are crazy.  Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights  and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the  car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.  The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!  We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several   regiments of psychotherapists.  There is no justification for US military involvement because there  is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,  if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably  stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing  to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we   leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.                                  BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like   Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money   or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered   to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said  a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any   of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always  get stuck with this stuff?  Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement  there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or  (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

Much of the time "Child protection" concernsitself with protecting the child from its natural parents.  Once itsin the "system", the government's concern for the child tends to go to zero.

To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary tocarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity "identical tothose in Nagorno Karabakh".

The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsinwith a request "to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russiansoldiers". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedingson the case in Baku as "a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia".     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one couldbelieve the Yerevan agency "Snark", the Armenians in Karabakh presentedan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatumis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners inKarabakh will be shot dead.     It is simple to explain such "touching attitude of Armenians" tothe six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executedit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accusedRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Ministerof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of itssaving of lives of "innocent Russians". --O--NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry ofAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijanfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.

Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble isthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.     According to the representatives of the business circles andexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rublesare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financialoperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republicsof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmenarrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, theexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitutionof the Republic of Azerbaijan.

At the same talk he declared, that in casethe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authorsof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership ispaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey fromthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia andUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partialUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development ofoil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspianfields.

Indeed, I believe it is the Islamic religion whichavoids alcohol (I apologize if I name the wrong religion) and thatis certainly a physical positive in many respects.  However, thisproves nothing.  Just because something is a "basic, pragmaticprinciple of day-to-day living" TODAY doesn't mean it evolved fromthe same.  Especially those beliefs and (mostly) positions held basedon interpretations of the religion.Religious beliefs come from many places but most will be backed up(after many levels of arguments) to "Because that's how it is written."or "God says..."  Now I'm not faulting that but that is not a basic,pragmatic principle as you mean it in this context.  It is a beliefbased on faith, which by definition is not necessarily backed up bylogic.  Faith is a given.  God is a absolute truth when arguing fromreligion.  Also, many religions would reject your thesis that theirbeliefs simply come from these day-to-day principles.In summation, if you wish to use religious arguments be prepared toback them up with "It says in the [fill in religious document here],"because most religions (things which at least I denote as religions)are based on the writings of or teachings of [fill in religiousfigure here].NOTE: Religion is a charged topic and if I offended anyone regarding  my references to God, I apologize.

Althoughthere are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, Iseriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in anysettlement.The Golan Heights is a serious security problem, and Israel obviouslywill have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (One shouldremember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was tobe in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewishstate, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.

Prior historywould seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves.Last I knew there was no National Branch Davidian Partyblaming the debacle in VeitNam on Foreign Meddlers andthree-two beer, calling for the Rounding up of Meat Packers,Growers and Slaughter Houses.You want tough political choices - how about letting odd ballsbe odd balls?  (I know, this requires tolerance for those that go into Government - but we all know peoplewho have no useful skills.)ith the death of the children everybody is gettingreal upset - what about the other 40 plus people?I suppose that you consider children to be propertyof the state with the family as custodians. (In theStates its the other way around - children are parental property.)If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands thatyou send you children into _their_ tender care - Isuppose that you will obey the State and turn you childrenover to their care.

La Groupe des Cooper-antes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and ifyou were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it asthe well-lit one with double-turrets at the top.  As for Ontario,which still dominates and anchors business up north ...Canada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free TradeAgreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishmentold money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on oneside, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses andprofessionals on the other.  The final Trudeau administration andthe first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveauxriches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and thatmotivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian'sinitiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head countof his caucus after the 1984 election).>It's not really insurance if you don't have alternativesWell, you have to realize that in our society that's like sayingthat "it's not really national defence" because you can't hireyour own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.(BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about theirportion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurancealternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostileto whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of theirfew redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;).>Also, in the April 14 Globe and Mail, there was a letter from the>director of trauma services at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto>responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in>California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that>American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada>rationed vital services.

In fairness, he did say that both the US and >Canadian systems are in the same situation.The only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods ofhigh demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tightfist on the licencing.  An obvious difference is that in such atransient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battlingover Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed byrationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient*situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge theCalifornia health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationingamong the insured population.  With smaller markets, there is muchless flexibility when dealing with our insured population thanCalifornia (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in aMUCH more dense area).  So he is correct in that the resources arefixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctorsmonopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in eithercase.  As for being "refused treatment" the government of the daywould be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen;Canadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that theirhealth care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too manypeople have bought into socialist trype that we have socializedmedicine.>I know, I know, the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads>them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more>money from the government (another case of businessmen, once>scratched, becoming socialists).  Right, as I've pointed out above ...>But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place>to the other? It hasn't really solved it.Either way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since thechanges in the private medical care resource take place at a slowerrate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light ofdisasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heartdisease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship and specialty training.>People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their >insurance when they really don't need to.That's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather thaneducation, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives arearguing for (the leftists?  "Ah, just let 'em spend!" --- yeah,right!).  Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptionsunder some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your privateinsurance that covers it just like in the U.S.  Still, it alladds up in the OECD measures.>In fact, Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people>get Don Cherry jokes (:-).We get the Sabres' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight (theDevils' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game).>(The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess? And just when I thought >I understood Canadian politics).Yeah, it's a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devinehas been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt.  TheSask NDP have taken a neo-conservative turn like Hawke, Gonzalezand Mitterand did.>has anybody considered following Singapore's example and going to a>system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic>coverage for everybody, and then you also have an IRA sort of thing>to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical>expenses only? It would tend to discourage you from overusing it.The medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lowercatastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the publicpurse if someone exhausts their IRA.  Also, Singapore has a muchmore autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses(if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication ... I don'tmean any disprespect here) where they'd let you just die.>One of the good things about being the last country to create a>national health care system, should we decide to, is that we have>everybody else's mistakes to learn from.That's true ... the question is how much leeway is there betweenthe U.S. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches ofCanada, France and Germany.>>Seriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a>>two/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy>>prof, D.G.

Yes, many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not toofar from a bigger town.  Just take a look at a detailed atlas ...or better, take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto.My first time across Lake Ontario to NYC, I was amazed by theincrease in density ... and the Toronto region is the densest in all of Canada.>There was one about a group of doctors in Calgary who have opened>Canada's first US-style MRI clinic, as an alternative to the>provincially owned one.It's about time!  I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why theydon't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's theirmoney.  But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, andthat's none of my business.  As for "provincially owned" ... for sureit's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involvedin the provision of health care except in the military or native reser-vations.  What that term actually means is that the facility gets byon public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding.Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north.  My ownbest friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN,and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.>There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of>two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act.No, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we haveprivate practices ... and always have.  They can all take cashanyways ... so why not have a particular facility?  The Canadianbig government mentality often imagines government where it doesnot even exist ...Since the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and lesslaidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadianscan do the same.  As I've pointed out above, the law states that it isillegal for the *government* to provide any health services except forthe military and natives.Look, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ...nobody stopped them when they bought it.  Nobody seems to be stoppingthem from using it, either.  Much ado about nothing.  Thank goodnessthat hockey playoffs have started ...>While it seemed currently unjustified, there was one anecdote told by>the head of the partnership to demonstrate the MRI.

I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.There are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries withoutrelying on MRI ... unfortunately, I've had a few. )-;  And I'm nota banker.

At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closingdown, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntialcelebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raiseunemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.        I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* educationproblems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lackof money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a "tax heaven"and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* seea correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.The average administrator makes two and a half times what the averageteacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an "Education crisis"in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idioticprograms get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's anunwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Educationis *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first tobut cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their childrenthan ugly art.>|>       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.

This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada'sviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Ournon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  Itwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of guncontrol laws.       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural andenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and thenthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.>Given that most>criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who>purchase them legally, having more restrictions on legal possession does >seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes.         Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punishedbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit acrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address thequestion of Canada.

(Well, it makes sense to some of us, anyway.  ;-)       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs"are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminalshave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simplysee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns aswell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.>>If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics, you would>>realize that:>>  -our non-gun crime rate is also very high, so guns per se are not the issue>>Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and>Vancouver, B.C.  The non-gun rates were roughly the same for both cities.  The>difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related.          And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiquesof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel cometo mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almostentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketedfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when youcompared the white majority they were virutally identical.        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relativeconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage ofnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take intoaccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in thesame conditions.        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which arearguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a farhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not onlynot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightlylower.>>  -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city>>Surprise.

The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city"problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a conditionwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violentcrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun controlis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As oneCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun controlin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increasein violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparentlythey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime inthe early eighties.>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already>>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.  Those areas implemented gun control because of>the high rates.         True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., wheregun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but thatcrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was highor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impactviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than itwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate bysaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be institutedto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, youcan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause ofthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun controlwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.

Theyinclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, thefact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and thehistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visitreligious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  TheJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned aJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in theirlatrines.Israel has allowed individuals of all religions intoJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness tocontrol the city.Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered inJerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike IsraeliJerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.AdamAdam Shostack        adam@das.harvard.edu"If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we surewouldn't waste them on members of Congress..."   -John Perry Barlow

Besides,the ranch house (not "fort apocalypse"; it was just a house despite whatthe FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The "Gun loonies" couldn't hardlyhave been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines thereto put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn'teven tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope thatthe FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved inthis fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.

Sadder still, the Americanpeople will probably believe them.> Next question.> > > The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters> to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government thatis becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  Onthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegalguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weaponshasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs brokeany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if thisis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcoholviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they shouldstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out oftheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.> The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to> attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention.

Human life---children and adultsalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armedreligious wackos".David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come outpeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ONTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and causethis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVELIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.> It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity > to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead> he ordered the murder of the children. Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of thecult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall thatit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught onfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentionsof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDEREDEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF stilldon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call theWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.> In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive> the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the > suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

If the sick little monkeys inWashington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns thenthey will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.

What *exactly* does the American Constitution say about "the right to association" ?    Homosexuals, whether Clayton likes it or not, are as much membersof society as he is. As such they have the right to participate andhave an equal opportunity to pursue their goals.   No-one is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate withqueerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question wouldobject also 8-) ), but by proclaiming the general right not to associatewith them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc),he's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights toequal access to opportunity.   Historically, people can associate publically with disliked groupswith very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normalcommerce has a severe impact on their lives.

 27From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:    Male sex survey: Gay activity low    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough    examination of American men's sexual practices published since    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent thathomosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the generalmale population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown forstraight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramaticallyhow much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.-- Clayton E.

EDT            Q  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?             MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to 10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At 11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At 12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the various groups.          Q  A photo op with Vessey?          MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.          Q  Why?          MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.            Q  What about the lunch?          MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.          Q  Is he meeting with any congress people today?          MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.          Q  There are no meetings --          MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, no.          Q  Has the President been given any information by the Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the Vietnamese on that subject?          MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese about first.          Q  Did the President talk with any Republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.          Q  How many times?          MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last night.          Q  What was the outcome of that?          MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package.          Q  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any way flexible on this?          MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement.          Q  Did they discuss the VAT tax?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.          Q  Can you check that?          MS. MYERS:  Sure.     Q  So what are they -- is the President offering to scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down to where Dole will sign on?          MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress including, obviously, Senator Dole.          Q  Is he talking to anybody else?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other Republicans yesterday.          Q  Is he talking to anybody today?          MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it out.          Q  We were led to believe that the President called Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?          MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, but it was both.          Q  In the President's mind, are they linked politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to the American people?  Has he made that argument?          MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional Russian aid last night in Tokyo.          Q  But does the President believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?          MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs package through the Congress.          Q  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating now with Dole?          MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.          Q  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the Senate for the jobs package.          Q  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other than Shelby?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a vote.          Q  What about Kohl?          Q  Kohl and Feingold?          MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of the members of the United States Senate support the package.          Q  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?          MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.          Q  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)          MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.          Q  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any other Republicans again today?          MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but again, I wouldn't rule it out.          Q  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today?          MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package.          Q  Will you share those with us?          MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.          Q  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --          MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And we certainly can continue to provide them today.          Q  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has been given?          MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add to that.          Q  But he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --          MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't think he said he was directly contacted by them.          Q  Are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this --          MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think I want to add to that.          Q  In February, though, the President said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind?          MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is something that the working groups are looking at.  They're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the President's health care plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.          Q  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being considered by anyone in the White House after the President's comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.          Q  And then suddenly --          Q  What happened?     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax.     Q  But the President himself took this off the table, Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and no decisions have been made.     Q  And it raises the question of how independently the task force is working.     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're considering all options.     Q  But that's not the impression that the President left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table, not an option.      Q  "If it changes I'll tell you."          Q  Bring him on.     Q  And you repeatedly referred to the President's remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.          MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)          Q  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers --     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.     Q  Is it because he has very few options?     Q  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with the President?       MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on.     Q  They will present it to him as one of his options, though he specifically ruled it out?     MS. MYERS:  Correct.     Q  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation?     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that they're looking at is the VAT.      Q  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not?     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is.  I don't know.     Q  Who was telling you that it was not under consideration?     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's comments.     Q  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package?     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan.          Q  I'm asking whether the projections --          MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know.     Q  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages.     MS. MYERS:  Correct.       Q  The question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.            Q  And when the President has been meeting with health care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing --          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q     they have never once said to him, these are your funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT in his --          MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular briefings.          Q  Well, you have.          MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.          Q  No, but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option.          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.          MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.          Q     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --          MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  It's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed.          Q  It's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that the option has not been presented to him.          MS. MYERS:  That is correct.          Q  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?          MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have nothing to add to what's already been said.          Q  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive?          MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if.          Q  But do you stand by the previous conversations in February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said you'd exclude food and energy --          MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn't been made.          Q  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --          Q  Could you check for us, because that's a real important credibility question?          MS. MYERS:  Sure.          Q  Since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?          MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to add.          Q  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us.          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.          Q  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --          MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about this issue.          Q  All we were trying to find out --          MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out and I've given you the answers, Helen.          Q  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made it an option again.  That's the --          MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.            Q  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?          MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously considering and the President has not made a decision on.          Q  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.          MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.          Q  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table?          MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.           Q  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change his mind?          MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.          Q  Did he change his mind?          MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we'll let you know.          Q  So he must have changed his mind, right?          MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, --          Q  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority exceeds the President's.          MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options; they've done that.          Q  Are you going to put out his income tax?          MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be available.           Q  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through it?          MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you through the questions.          Q  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms.          MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)          Q  Could we have one?          MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it.          Q  Did they file a joint form?          MS. MYERS:  Yes.          Q  When did he file it?          MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.          Q  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for Miyazawa?          MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the meeting.          Q  No backgrounder today?          MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.          Q  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  (Laughter.)          MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)          Q  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach?          MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --          Q  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you?          MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, which we've been saying regularly.          Q  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?          MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them every day.          Q  Which doesn't work so --          MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on the 26th.            Q  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us any documentation?          MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.          Q  There's been no -- you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.          MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if you'd like.          Q  We would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you provide something along those lines?          MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.          Q  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced this morning -- where is that money coming from?          MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the details of that package.          Q  So that would be new money that you would hope to get?          MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.          Q  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.          MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do something immediately, which required money that was already approved in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to work with Congress to make that happen.          Q  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by Congress?          MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward.          Q  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through Congress?          MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with Congress.          Q  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?          MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do.          Q  Who are they?          MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union of Police Associations.          Q  Will the FBI chief be there?          MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.          Q  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?          MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these national law enforcement organization leaders.          Q  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?          MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.          Q  So this would be the $700 million that's in the budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?          MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 million already in the budget.          Q  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or Fiscal '94 --          MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.          Q  This $1.8 billion on top of --          MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.          Q  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was calling Bob Dole?          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?          MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.          Q  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the other night, the satellite and all of this relationship.Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these Chambers of Commerce?          MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives.          Q  What's the status of the President thinking about going to this Democratic retreat?          MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost certainly go.          Q  All three days?          MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be there yet.            Q  Is it open to coverage?          MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.          Q  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?          MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or what --          Q  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?          MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it out.          Q  What about an AIDS czar?          MS. MYERS:  It's coming.          Q  Anything on the weekend?          Q  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march.          MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic retreat.          Q  The weekend?          MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on right now is the radio address on Saturday.          Q  Any travel plans?          MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.          Q  He's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.          Q  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?          MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.          Q  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.          Q  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?          MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.          Q  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going to be focused on the stimulus package?          MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.          THE PRESS:  Thank you.

 235Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1qlaap$rst@genesis.MCS.COM>NNTP-Posting-Host: localhost.mcs.com  The following was posted and no doubt retyped by Yigal Ahrens and considering  the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in  California, I am reposting to other appropriates groups.    From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.  EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer  SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12,000 people.  Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American, right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations.  Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking any laws.  Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.  People who were subjects of the spy operation included former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who is based in South Africa.  Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the South African government.  In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment, his office said.  Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.  The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws. League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.  But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches, San Francisco police alleged that "ADL employees were apparently less than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant.  David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said the organization has not violated the law.  "There is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said.  "Our record speaks for itself."  The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations."  Lehrer, according to the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L. Patterson.  An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.  Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as "Skins" and "Pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance.  "I might never see or call up on 99% of them again," Bullock said. "And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under, say, 'Pinko.'"  In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the FBI in the case.  A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses, vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license photographs.  Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and Bullock also provided information to the South African government, receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.  The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss nature of the spy operation.  The file notes that Kraft's articles "appear frequently in The Times and are well researched and written," but little else about the file is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal information.  Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as "Scott" and "Scumbag."  He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast, exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may have come from Los Angeles police officers.    From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.  ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups.  But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax violations and conspiracy.  Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful about its spying operations, which collected information on more than 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum.  Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures.  Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file.  In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H. Foxman described the ADL as "a Jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years."  Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police, journalists, academics, government officials and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain information illegally, he said.  "Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information," Foxman said.  The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than "a private individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'"  Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.  "Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from ADL," Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator. Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.  Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.  A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants, produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.  "The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us," the district attorney said. -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it! arens@isi.edujs

Oh great.  Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting  each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes  as "out of control" and atrocities being reported from both sides.  These people are crazy.  Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights  and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the  car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.  The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!  We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several   regiments of psychotherapists.  There is no justification for US military involvement because there  is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,  if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably  stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing  to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we   leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.                                  BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like   Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money   or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered   to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said  a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any   of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always  get stuck with this stuff?  Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement  there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or  (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

 15My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattleand died on Day 9 of the siege.  On Day 11 of the siege he rose from thedead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over thenext 40 days.  Living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy,as Timmy Baterman's father in *Pet*Sematary* could attest, so after 40days they did what Baterman did--shot themselves and burned the placeto the ground.Consistent with the facts, isn't it?

EDT               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.            Q  Could we do this on the lawn?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.          Q  Is the stimulus package dead?           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.            Q  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You said it was a good visit, but no compromise.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked about that yesterday afternoon.          At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific compromises made on either side, they did say that they would continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.          Q  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are both making concessions?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to make those adjustments.          Q  On the subject of a VAT --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.          Q  Can we stay on this for one more minute?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.          Q  We have a problem with the five minutes --          Q  I know no decisions have been made, but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been made.          Q  To follow, have they done that directly through him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.          Q  At the meetings that he's had with his own task force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been presented for a decision, no.          Q  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an option?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.            Q  You're not saying he didn't know it was being considered, though, are you?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.          Q  He knew that.          Q  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  That's what I'm asking.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I don't even know that it's --          Q  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at this stage?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is considered --           Q  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed it.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just repeated.           Q  George, is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out the way it did, that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is now public knowledge that this is being considered.          Q  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it come out not from you people, but --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out from the administration.  What are you talking about?          Q  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said he would let us know.           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.          Q  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that it's not going to be on the program.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.          Q  On March 25th.           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.          Q  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right here, and AP story -- "Clinton wants more money for spying."          Q  What about his remark that if it were being considered, he'd tell us about it?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, and he'd let you know.          Q  And did he?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say this morning?          Q  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his administration.  That is his administration policy.          Q  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they answered the questions.          Q  You're saying here that it didn't have to be dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  Painfully clear.          Q  Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they answered that it was being considered.          Q  George, The New York Times --          Q  Why do it yesterday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.          Q  The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, but which turned out to be totally false.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they say that.           Q  The question is, is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he doing about it, if so?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the matter.          Q  Isn't that the same information that goes to the President?          Q  If I could go back to the stimulus package --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of information.  I think that's where the confusion was.          Q  When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.          Q  And as far as you know, is the President aware of it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.          Q  And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.          Q  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  Anything?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.          Q  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.          Q  Did they drop it -- is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to get this jobs package going.          Q  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the timing like that.          Q  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.          Q  Has there been any indication that this situation has changed?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.          Q  George, last week you said that there are -- or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus package.          Q  He initiated the conversation?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You say he's making --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get it through, he will.          Q  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.          Q  Today?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed.          Q  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.          Q  What are the follow-up discussions if not the President and Dole?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Dole.          Q  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)          Q  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.          Q  Did they discuss actual numbers?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the level of this many x-billion dollars.           Q  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.          Q  Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.          Q  And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, no.          Q  George, is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves having to pay for the have-nots?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.          Q  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is not true.  It's actually waste water money.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.           Q  But it would not affect the drinking water problem because it's waste water money, right?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment overall.           Q  But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  Would you agree that's not the case?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.          Q  A leftover question from this morning, which was, when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.            Q  So sometime since March 25th?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know the exact date.          Q  George, the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already proposed?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.           Q  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the income tax, for instance?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on that.          Q  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it have a chance?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.           Q  Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration now.          Q  You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under consideration.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered.          Q  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.           Q  Is that true?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the deliberations.          Q  But, George --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as the President said, groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.           Q  Is that the only thing that's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Can you explain how those groups -- how that information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.          Q  But this is the President's knowledge that these groups had come forward.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been published positions in the newspapers.          Q  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's presentations to them?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups.          Q  What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care.          Q  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding positions?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.          Q  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February and now --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.          Q  I know, but the President said that it was off the table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been made to the President --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the presentations to the health care task force.          Q  There's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue.          Q  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that he said anything to refute that.          Q  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task force ever suggested that there would.          Q  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical situation.            Q  But does that promise -- would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the implications then.          Q  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just don't have that.          Q  George, can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not going to comment --          Q  What's the scope --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on them, no.          Q  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task force is looking at.          Q  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?          Q  Does no mean yes.          Q  Yes and no.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S. that we want to do something about.          Q  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.          Q     that we need specific export targets, specific numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with Miyazawa?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into those specifics until after the meeting.          Q  Why?          Q   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.          Q  But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.          Q  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages.          Q  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can.          Q  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on the Bosnia policy.  And he said, "It's a rather emotional response."       MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.          Q  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  House condone that kind of remark?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find answers for.           Q  But that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- specific term?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.          Q  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?          Q  To take stronger action, to take military action -- air strikes, anything that can be done?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time.          Q  What is your response to the critics who would say that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the arms embargo.          Q  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that change your thinking?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo.          Q  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.          Q  That's exactly what she said.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.          Q  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be released?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  And it will be probably later today.          Q  Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal for that at this time, not that I know of.          Q  It's something that the President promised during the campaign that he would do.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't think it's anything that's on his plate right now.          Q  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities.          Q  Do you know if that's scheduled --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.          Q  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)          Q  It's a good thing you asked.          Q  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.          Q  How long --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.          Q  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.          Q  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like that.          Q  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under discussion and something we've been working on.          Q  Campaign finance reform?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.          Q  Do you think it will be next week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.          Q  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working on?  I missed the question.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working on.          Q  Do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.          Q  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston on Sunday, as he did last year.          Q  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?          Q  On the gays.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the President's schedule for the day, certainly.          Q?    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is that Sunday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.          Q  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't know.          Q  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you about it.          Q  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --       MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)          Q     at the White House in the Bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make sure --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do anything like that.          Q  Certainly not.          Q  What marching orders did the President give to General Vessey?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to military archives.            And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the activities of the joint commission and on the document.          Q  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis at this stage?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the Vietnamese.          Q  A number of Defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to as Americans from time to time.  Do people --           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we have it, we'll make a judgment.          Q  I know you don't have any final determination, but given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that that's a likely possibility?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete.          Q  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech in Boston?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.           Q  Is the President going to have a press conference tomorrow with Miyazawa?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  Yes, I expect, yes.          Q  Was Toon in with Vessey?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.           Q  He was in on the meeting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  What was the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, and the answer is yes.           Q  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal report this morning the President's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --          Q  How many questions?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 occasions.          Q  How many were while he was jogging?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --          Q  Oval Office press conference -- when was that?           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and Connecticut --          Q  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The article implies that he doesn't --          Q  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)          Q  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?          Q  The story is that you -- are you held responsible for it.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment about this.          Q  Are you denying that the President has shown displeasure publicly?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the discussions between the President and myself.          Q  Did the President write that letter to Chris Webber?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?          Q  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball player?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.          Q  That is an authentic letter?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Since the President first talked about the VAT in February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a proposal he hasn't made.          Q  George, does the President have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.          Q  The military issue?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.          Q  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.          Q  George, what specifically is the President doing to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the Trade Representative and others.          Q     report yet?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him today.          Q  He was?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Does he intend to use any of these instances that --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.          Q  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he feels that way?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent history.     Q  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.            THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                 END                    1:34 P.M.

Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything elseto destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubtthat they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitivethreat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that themaintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and localgovernments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outsidecapital investment in the Southern states.# Craig A.

Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think itwas Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato."If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advancesin human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher".Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since hisideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtfulthat his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 yearsfrom now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.As for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the mostinfluential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone whocame after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and amplified them over time).I would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have tobe Dewey.But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respectwas "American", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.--Brian

From this we can immediately conclude that they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?

Your beliefs always determine your actions.  Thebeliefs may be wrong from my point of view but they are yours all the same.To make it more practical.  If I attempted to stick you with a needle youwould try to stop me because you believe it would hurt, or that I do nothave that right.  If you did not you would ignore me.  You certainly wouldit you saw me sticking the needle in a tree.Koresh may have been misguided, only God knows.  But the Jews at Masadadied for what they believed, the three Hebrews preferred to die in thefurnace rather than bow down, Daniel preferred to die in a lion's denrather than stop praying to his God, and as a Christian I am prepared todie for my faith.Koresh was not dying for now reason.  He had a cause.  Why should he giveup the children to forces he was convinced were evil.  The events arebizarre but they match his beliefs.Darius

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction>coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).There are "basic services" and there are "optional services", Dennis. Call waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phoneis a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the chargesfor the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendouslyinefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, abortion can be seen as a "basic service".Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stopyou carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...- Kevin

With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and        the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.

I personally can't reallyasses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although ifforced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI orBD) over intential setting of the fire).   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recoveredhad gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categoricallydenied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intenseheat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode andthat this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which isquite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.   In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the manyscenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical untilmore information is available.  |> -- |> *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)*       ___|> ** _____/_o_\\_____|> *Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,*(==(/_______\\)==)|> *Keep it less than 5 lines big.* \\==\\/     \\/==/-- Bob Garwood

 33it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriateboard but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide, the theft ofideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities.but every culture has its upside and its downside.  it seems to me that the white male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - ifyou're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to actively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig)it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the american indians civilization.  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one group of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded asequal - ain't that some stuff)white men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or havewack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose.  just look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD.  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a position.  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people.hmmm...  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history has been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies.awww that's enough already from me because this has nothing to do with sex or this board.  if ya'd like to continue this discussion e-mail me and we can compare and contrast ideasi like conflict - it's educational when the communcation is good......................my $.02 worth(i apologize to those who thought this was going to be about SEX but i wasprompted by a response i found up here)dave lewis - frisky HANDS man

That does not mean,however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  Theentire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jewsto have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many ofthem, and which had been denied to them for millenia.On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to thebest of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoideddamage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policiesof previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate andbigotry.-- ________________________________________Jack F.

EDT          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out the first pitch.          Q  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not Amtrack.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.          Q  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with  ??? Senate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be passed.          Q  Will he compromise, that's the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President believes his jobs program should go forward.          Q  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right now, let's see what happens today.          Q  Would he go that far -- no matter what the Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per year?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's see what happens.          Q  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days.          Q  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package through?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.          Q     prepared to compromise --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole.           Q  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.          Q  How?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall.          Q  He can't beat this, can he?          Q  The fact is they can do that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop action.  There's no question about that.          Q  What are you going to do about it?          Q  George, what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that when they say yes they mean no?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.          Q   Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.          Q  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I'm not positive.          Q  George, was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --          Q  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the Japanese say yes they mean no."          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.          Q  Was he saying it facetiously first?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual observation.          Q  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I'm not sure exactly how many.          Q  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no      MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is on.          Q  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that.          Q  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.          Q     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, Saddam can't stay in office?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will continue to demand it.          Q  And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping support of terrorism.          Q  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you base that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments.          Q  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power?     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power.          Q  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.            Q  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.          Q     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.          Q     going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer?          Q     work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President's intiatives?          Q  But on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes?  When you have to go through --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the President's going to continue to reach out when he can.          Q  You don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.          Q  They're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --          Q     any ideas.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.          Q     to present them.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean they get the votes --          Q     that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're playing.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.          Q  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?          Q     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about anything recently.          Q     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation, including the situation in Los Angeles.            I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to watch it.          Q  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management.  Does the President have a position on that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game.          Q  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see Reverend Jackson while he's out there?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.          Q  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it.          Q  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be there, and is he going to meet with the President?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.          Q  What is the Mubarak schedule?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore.          Q  And joint statements tomorrow --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, yes.          Q  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.          Q  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action.  But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all.          Q  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.          Q  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your question.          Q  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what does the U.S. do next?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement.          Q  George, why do you think sanctions is still an option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When does no mean no and you have to do something different?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.          Q  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something that is under consideration.          Q  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's condition, how he's doing?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.          Q  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit.          Q  Is he going somewhere for Easter?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.          Q  What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks.          Q  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the magnitude.          Q  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where do you stand on that --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a hard look at it.          Q  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll be able to get our own researchers working as well.          Q  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under discussion.          Q  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter of time and -- for months before that happens.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll continue to review other matters.          Q  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule this week?  Any travel?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right now.          Q  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,      MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate discussions.          Thanks.                                 ###

Machiavelli described the reasoning in thePrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likudbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenouspopulation.The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as "public land". The assertionthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs toan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly anexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens broughtin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of theGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territoriesmust not be changed. No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologistswill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all ofthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.|>The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people|>to move across the green line.  They included security and politics.|>|>The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes|>it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.

Since thePalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely itis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be thereturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and thedismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination againstnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state hasa non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers theIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will meanoutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buyingor using much of the land. Phill Hallam-Baker

EDT                                       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming toyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radiostation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city tomeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weeklybroadcast with the American people.                           I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 whenit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the pastseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch withthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bustour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in lastyear's campaign.                          Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk withyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds andwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reportingto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.                          You sent me to Washington to get our government andeconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a badexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how importantit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we dobusiness.                            We live in a competitive global economy.  Nationsrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitivenessof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and thecooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,labor and government.  Although many of the economies of theindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they'vemade many of the smart investments and the tough choices whichour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of themhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have beenfalling behind.                          We have an economy today that even when it grows isnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nationby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much toshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people havestopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeksand that too many families can no longer afford the escalatingcost of health care.                          But we also know that, given the right tools, theright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers andbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economyneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities betterplaces to live.                          In many critical products today Americans are thelow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure thatwe create more of those kinds of jobs.                          Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan forlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the oldpriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs tobe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobsand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping thewaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our preciousresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays thegroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.                          These new directions passed the Congress in recordtime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in ourcountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which wouldcreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the privatesector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  Itnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in theSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they knowwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.                          The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation andcounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs billhas been grounded by gridlock.                            I know the American people are tired of business asusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spinor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I havetaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extramile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                            It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 millionAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the billlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will meanhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is toact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By takingthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, Ithink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significantportion of our original goals.                          First, we want to keep the programs as much aspossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,including highway and road construction, summer jobs for youngpeople, immunization for children, construction of waste watersites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep fundingfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people whohave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn'tcreating jobs.                          Second, I've recommended that all the other programsin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40percent.                          And third, I've recommended a new element in thisprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight againstcrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehirepolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and putthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fightfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need itand deserve it.                          Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because itincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending thisyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is morethan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and thisbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by theCongress this year.                          It's amazing to me that many of these same senatorswho are filibustering the bill voted during the previousadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind ofemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put theAmerican people to work.                            This is not about deficit spending.  We have offereda plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your prioritiesare -- on people or on politics.                            Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollarfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's thesoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and ourchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobsand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all ofus when we've helped make more American partners working toensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                          You know, if every American who wanted a job hadone, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in thiscountry today.

 13Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan?  I'm interestedin knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how theydealt with it.  I've heard, undocumented, that Japan years ago used heavylegal penalties to end a serious heroin problem.  I'd like to know bothsides of the story.  Does anyone recall such a problem?  What were lawsat the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking?  Whatare the laws now?  What other anti-drug measures, like education and treatmenthas Japan used?  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people?  How effectivehave anti-drug measures been in Japan?  Thanks for your help.  - David Borden    borden@m5.harvard.edu

Everyone's property rights were> protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement> costs were avoided.Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts aspresented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.<*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York   State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their   highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme   Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the   "Court of Appeals."  To make matters worse, New York also calls its   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company'splant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as towhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or hedefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the courseof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to theplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from theplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they askedthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al ownedtheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the courtordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, providedthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  Inother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, thepower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoymentof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain isalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing aprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But ifit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quackslike eminent domain...)Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow theplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-milliondollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under    extortion statutes.")How do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the rightto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it ownsand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or ofdemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I seeit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position ofowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted tostay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever pricethey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that saysthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.You go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- theplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K tohaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount lessthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements fromother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by thoseother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choicebetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that wasAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the typeof plant they did where and when they did.)And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; theplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as ownersof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a priceacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ madewhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts weresupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as "infamous?"  That's really sad if> it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible.> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of> filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever> inexplicable reasons.(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at myschool.(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring fortheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I firstencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personalopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students getinto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pickand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory ProfessionalResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldlyand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciouslyintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openlybiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructorstend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This isespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, arepracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhatcloistered scholar.  End of aside.)I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasonsI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I canonly call "economic correctness" over justice.(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the allegedright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoidlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, andthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees tonot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people whoown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any otherbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to takeother people's property by eminent domain.)> You'd like Posner, Bill.  He's a libertarian.Really?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to sayabout cases like _Boomer_?> Of course, he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a> president, Democrat (won't like his antitrust stance) or Republican> (won't like his support of gay marriage), and if bright law students> "shiver" at what they don't understand, it's easy to imagine how the> press will play it up as baby-selling.  (I've seen Mike Godwin claim> that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything> and is the end-all and be-all, when Posner says precisely the> opposite.)  So it goes.I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred toas "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economicalanalysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use tohelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured bythe scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economicsof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.-- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

Israel has statedrepeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan, but may bewilling to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace agreement.Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the 1967 war.These areas are not occupied, but disputed, since there is nolegitamate governing body.  Citizenship was given to those residentsin annexed areas who wanted citizenship.Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank, IMHO.The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge,which contain few arab towns, and many suburbs, as well as overlookingthe city of Tel Aviv.  The Eastern mountain ridge should beabandonded.  This is where most of the arabs live and it is lessmilitarily relevant.  Israel should also maintain a presence in theJordan valley.>If so (for those of you who support it), why were so>many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,>let's hear it.There are a number of reasons for people to move (they werenot moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  Note that sincethese moves were made by free willed human beings, not "settlers," Iwill address two aspects of your question, why the government wouldallow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.The government had a number of reasons for encouraging peopleto move across the green line.  They included security and politics.The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makesit difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements alsoact as fortresses in times of war.A second reason was political.  Creating "settlements" broughtthe arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns andcities gone on another several years, there would be no place left inIsrael where there was an arab majority.  There would have been noland left that could be called arab.The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in placechanges the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land canbe given away.Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons fordoing so.  They include financial, religious, and political reasons.Many of the communities created were "bedroom" communities.Suburbs.  A house 20 minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if itwas on the wrong side of the green line.  People who moved therewanted a decent home at a nice price.Some of the communites created were religious.  They builttheir neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots ofthe 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.The last reason people moved was to establish a politicalJewish presense outside the green line.  They built communities tocontrol important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and otherplaces.The point is, there are many reasons people moved over thegreen line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whateverstatus is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an "allor nothing" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, notbe the results of a war.AdamAdam Shostack        adam@das.harvard.edu"If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we surewouldn't waste them on members of Congress..."   -John Perry Barlow

He didn't say so, but Iknew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if whatyou say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling such basic services, too).> >>******************************************************************  >>>>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  >>ACHE AND PAIN?  >>>>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  >>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  >>bills.  >>>>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  >>per-person health bill than we do.> >It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two>things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like>real health insurance -- which actually it is).

I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers didn't go along with theprovinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there wasa good chance of the public system going bust in the long run, and then afterwards they could clean up (Okay, this sort of contradicts what I saidhigher up. But it's another possibility). They'd have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.

EDT               Q  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton.          And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.          Q  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty.          It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case.          The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie.          No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.            I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs.          And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do.            And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.          Q  Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that battle?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.          But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come to a vote.          I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.          So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.          Q  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this --Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented.          You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work.            So I just hope that this doesn't become a political issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs.          Q  I have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew it was going to be like this.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things.            But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November, and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making real, real progress.            I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing things.          Q  Thank you very much.            The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA News.                               END10:31 A.M. EDT

In consultinga 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, ora LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you arewrong.By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broadprohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such asCalifornia, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter wasterribly upset about this.I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in aclinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wonderinga bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrificedoesn't have a grain of truth to it.-- Clayton E.

Remember what Spock said:"the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".As long as government spending does not contradict the ConstitutionI don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected a group of people to make decisions in one direction. And if this is bad, then we should elect a new government. Democratic systems workthis way, and I don't have anything against you raising an opinionin your case.

What solutions do people have that  would have been>better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months?Well, they never should have gotten into this situation.Look at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested?twice?  by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrantand went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do theychoose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience underarrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building. In addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were toldthat they suspected him of molesting children and having severalwives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changedtheir story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed.And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but didanyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koreshhadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeinghim just a week before the raid.How would I have handled it differently? Well, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anythingwrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories whichkeep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.OK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for.Well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I sendofficers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests.Covered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reasonto suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn'tanyone TRY serving a warrant?OK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary toraid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak,and they know your coming. SO what do you do?  Well, change yourplans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... includingsending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. Idon't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raidshould NEVER have happened.The shit that came later should NEVER have happened.The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let usknow what the hell really happened there.The lies should NEVER have been told.<MC>-- || Mark Craig Carroll: <MC>     ||"We the people are getting tired of your lies|| Univ of Delaware, Dept of CIS|| We the people now believe that it's time|| Grad Student/Labstaff Hacker || We're demanding our rights to the answers|| carroll@udel.edu             || We elect a precedent to state of mind"-Fish

(They do account for a somewhat largerportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% oftotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averagedpaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, healthcare costs have increased more than any period in history.As far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the AMA estimates that itstotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the totalcurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a groupthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicineon health care.As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnificationof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by theirspecialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suitswhile retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

Those rights (and the lives of innocent men, women(some pregnant), and children) were sacrificed to save the FederalGovernment from being embarrassed.

This is possible. Officialsin higher positions than hers have been duped. We have no choice sowe may as well give her another chance.

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuctioncoverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murderfor reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at allanymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortioncoverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.  Or are wegoing to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support ofabortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one'sconscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.eduPS Sure read through the two short form letters I posted at the beginningof this post.

You'd have to be very unfamiliar with US history to   think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in   in 1932.  The police could generally get away with a lot more  in those days, there were few citizens and media "watchdog"   organizations, no "Miranda" rulings, and women, blacks, gays,  and other such groups had very few right indeed.  Moreover  censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant  at that time (think about "banned in Boston" or the Hays  Commission).    My comments were directed against those who see these sorts  of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to   vanish.---peter
 29Joe,     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explainingproblems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea thatsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise orsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non africanamericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assertthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, wesomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction.Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe thatsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want todeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against africanamericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible bethat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this hasa very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it werent' so damn typical.Peace - Aaron

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of   September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively   addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security   Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all   unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There   have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages   in Bosnia have been bombed.    In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,   in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all   unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize   Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.    NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air   enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General   was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY   FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating   allies.    The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my   direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to   all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct   of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by   the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces   initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and   12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.    These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.   e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for   combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.    NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air   patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early   Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally   operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the   Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching   the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,   escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these   steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such   aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by   NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved                                   more                                      (OVER)\f                                  2    rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will   be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations   Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was   consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully   considered before the rules of engagement were approved.    It is not possible to predict at this time how long such   operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces   to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional   authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and   I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward   toward attainment of our goals in this region.                      Sincerely,                            WILLIAM J. CLINTON                                       #  #  #

Although price controls have promoted an expansion of servicesto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than thevast expansion that has occurred.>>> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but>> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) >>Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an>array of products at prices below cost?  Are not grocery stores>embedded in a relatively free market?Can you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do notattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more ofit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears thatprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion ofservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simplymake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsdaypredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restrictionof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appearsthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel toSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficialresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that "governmentbureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplaceshould take such such cases into account.jsh>>=Mark--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

I respect anybody  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel  and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic  vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and  its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt  (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its  Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,  Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the  whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries  they are living.  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish  nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big  social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other  minorities of the country.  > I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government.

All you have done is>put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back>up your claim that the FBI was responsible.In my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the FBI: a) indirectly,b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (I hope not thelatter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) causedthe fire. It is possible that someone inside the community startedthe fire because they "thought" God told them to or because they simplywould rather die than surrender. Who knows? We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Whyhaven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not theyheard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don'tremember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seemsto me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as theyhad promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify theFBI's lying as well?Will an "internal investigation" really reveal what happened, if in factthe BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in thenow-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in acourt of law.There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out whenthe fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed thestairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.Only those in another part of the house escaped.People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came runningout of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather thangoing back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I thinkthe FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically, btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the "evil feds" by any means.

 92Replying to A.J. Teel:Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that theIncome Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures forstopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for awhile now.Humbug.  Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at allin the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled thatincome tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have topay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  Thisissue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expectsomething squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case offederal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material"concrete proof".There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayersfinally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear theirreasons for disbelief at this point.Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You'veposted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason tobelieve that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seemon the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that Ifeel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your argumentshave any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve suchstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings areapplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appealto the Supreme Court.Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regularemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to payhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Courtwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totallyvoluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder whynot; why haven't you?Shall I conclude that the point has been received and theopposition has forfeited the field?With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position ofauthority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you wouldbe looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought youtold us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with bigbanking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing.Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the troubleto subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back intotheir burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the rightcombination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by USofficials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"?  Whenthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tellthem they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,D.C., where they belong?Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which yousuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can justdeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roadswith no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your walletcan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (withplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all thisgarbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up injail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my currentemployer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need tocare too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend-ment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keepon filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probablynot owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusionand/or the foreign tax credit).-- Rich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I want to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary Riley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving.            There were no two governors whom I admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher of the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom.          That's why today's ceremony honoring the National Teacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I might add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's Capital.  (Laughter.)          Within three years of being hired by a satellite high school, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national and international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a favored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and what our country needs.           Today, we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's why Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments.           Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  I'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)            MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation's schools.            We know that the quality of our children's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  (Applause.)     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome the education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the national education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize Tracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself a great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children, all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of America.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public servants.          Thank you very much.  (Applause.)                                      END1:29 P.M. EDT

There is norational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times thatof a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you wouldloose on the deal.)Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise haveeventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zerovalue.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman whofinds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater sufferingcaused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  Thatwoman is *already* a member of society.I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society isfar greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the sufferingof every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* deniedan abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the valueof all the potential future members of society that never became a part ofit (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).Think about it.Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering ofon-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, pleaseput forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I shouldeventually see it.)-Rob

 140The DEA and other organizations would have the American peoplebelieve that we are winning the "war on drugs".  I'm going todispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showingyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertionsI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearlydemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on therise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drugabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The realityis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply apossible solution to this problem.The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock musicand pot entitled "Hello Again, Mary Jane" which appears in thecurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  "Perhaps    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby    is out in full force," says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug    Enforcement Administration.  "The fact is, they're losing the    battle."  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders" by MikeSnider, p. 6D).    Adolescents' choices    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                      Estimated, per 100 students                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think you can see that oneof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression thatthe "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gonedown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post isan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt todeceive the public.Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the sametime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone downbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" isbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugsgo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placedin its true perspective.For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then trydrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell methat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitlessattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch toanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be tolegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to bewithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a fewtimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution isbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite thegovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on druginterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drugeducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime becausethe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which oftengoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact thataddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for theirmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fallsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has beendone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try toemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarceratingthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less thanthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been broughtabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people canlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco inorder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methodsbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carriedout.  They are as follows:    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law      enforcement.    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning      information should also be a felony.    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article havebeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thoughtit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand onWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in itthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove myassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

 11   A person sees the front of their home is strewn with garbage. Thatperson removes the trash, and sweeps the sidewalk. His next door neigh-bors have not.

 105Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-SovietArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

Call waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phoneis a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the chargesfor the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendouslyinefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, abortion can be seen as a "basic service".Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stopyou carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...- Kevin

 993NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu                         THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary                 (Vancouver, British Columbia) ______________________________________________________________                       BACKGROUND BRIEFING                               BY                 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS                          April 4, 1993                               Canada Place                  Vancouver, British Columbia  9:40 A.M. PST               Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package.     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.       Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow.          The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government.          Third, the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you.          Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.            They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship.          If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are.  I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.          The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.          The second item is concessional food sales.  As you know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal.          The third program is a collection of private sector support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.            The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.          The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're launching.            The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia.          The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project.            The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage.          I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time.            And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important.          You'll notice that the United States is going to support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.            You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference, the G-7 conference.          Before I take any further questions, I'd like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you.          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.          The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility.            And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years.            So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.           So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process.          Q  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the same one, why do you feel it's necessary?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced today.  So it's completely new.          Q  Can you tell us more about what's involved?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what Russia needs.          So we think this deal is very, very good development for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an American company.  And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.          Q  So it's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.          Q  On that point, should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.          Q  That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.          Q  What's the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any current year budget costs --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.          Q  The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.          Q  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?          Q     and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.          It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation.          Q     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the President talked about?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.          Q  Two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit into that situation?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales.            And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program.            I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and it's important for the American farm community.          Q  I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right?           SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution.            I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments.          Q  Where do those funds actually come from?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be able to do so.          Q  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the same level of food imports from the West.          Q  I would imagine there's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with some of the other republics?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries.           In the area of food sales, we have been active with Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they're hard-hitting.          Q  Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that.            We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production.            That's what the Russian government has told us it wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to support them.          Q  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to the work.          Q  What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs.          But they are all quite different.  For instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed.          So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the Russian government, some with Russian citizens.          Q  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the President has to do on that?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and we'll get back to the Russian government.          Q  You were not prepared for these questions when you got here?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action.          Q  Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And that's the advantage of this particular initiative.          Q  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where it stands now.          Q  We've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended.          We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs.          And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it.          Q  Where, for example, are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the Freedom Support Act funds.          Q  In other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds.          Q     cooperation --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.          Q  Could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's happened here --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation that's been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.            But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.          Q?    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been earmarked and put it into this fund?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.            We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is determined, to carry out every single program in this package.  And we'll do it.            But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.          Q     taken it way from any --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.          Q  In terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, but we thought we should now.            Q  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration.            But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, is another Clinton initiative.            Further, we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.            I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government, to achieve that objective.            So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia.          Q  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it's being administered by the Russian government?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their source.          I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another example of that.          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one area that we've been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.          Q  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts.          Q  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that.          Q  This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been together for about two weeks.          Q  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  Is that in the out years?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them.            And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way.            But let me get at the other part of your question.  The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active.          Q  There's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've primarily talked about future, about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, which is our base objective here.          Q  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.          Q     money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet allocated any money for that.          Q  Why not?          Q     of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian government.          Q     of the $6 million will go to retrain --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.          Q  Are you talking about apartment buildings or single --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about single, individual dwellings.          Q  You're saying that only 450 families will be served by this?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done.            I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely.          Q  What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think it's important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests.          Q  Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this program that does this?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it.          Q  And then on the question of Russia's ability to repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans.          Q     substantial government-to-government loan we've ever gotten into with the Russians?          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of effort.          Q     government loans in any other sector that you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --          SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair to say this is a new and unique effort.                               END10:25 A.M. PDT

This fits in well with a report inthe New York Times from April 18, 1993:***********************************Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in ClassroomsBy Chris HedgesCairo, April 17The khamseen, the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring, havebrought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but alsowhat the authorities describe as collective hysteria.Hundreds of teen-age girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms,breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea.[...]"There is no clinical reason for it," said Dr. Ahmed Rashed at AgouzaHospital, where dozens of girls have been tested.  "It's justhysteria.  We have carried out blood tests, urine tests, every kind oftest we can think of and nothing has shown up."More than a thosand young girls between 12 and 18 have sufferedattacks in some 40 schools across the country since the first caseswere reported over two weeks ago.[...]Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everythingfrom food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptianwomen infertile. Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe.One was reported about a decade ago in the Israeli-Occupied GazaStrip. Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret servicefor the spells.  "This is all the work of the Mossad," said a militantcleric in Imbaba, a Cairo slum.  "They are seeding capsules around thecountry that release something into the air that can't be detected.It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls.  It is part ofa plot to destroy Egypt."  [Where have seen this argument before?  Because there is no  evidence for the conspiracy, therefore it must be true...][...]Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical orenvironmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause waspsychological.  "If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faintfor some reason," he said, "the others start believing that they aresuffering from the sypmtoms."But no one is taking the matter lightly.  Prime Minister Atef Sedkihas held regular mettings with Mr. Dewidar to discuss the attacks.Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenonto an end."Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept theresults of our scientific analysis," Education Minister Hussein KamalBahadeen said.***********************************You can't make this stuff up.

Theidea being that in a just cause God will supply amunition "fear notfor the Lord himself shall place the arrows in your bow". Neat eh?

Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY togive you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From manyof the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain aboutthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say thatMr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make thisascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people haveused it in the past.      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled todiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there wouldnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating wouldnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult callto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.        I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive thanme using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you havebeen happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really arelost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting onepersons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.     The way you went about this 'polite' inquiry makes me believe it was anything but.

Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billiondollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase ofapprox. 884 billion dollars.       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccountedfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, ormore than national defense started.  (This represented an increaseof 230%)       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars onMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of368%)       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housingcredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billiondollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.            About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development,"in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of themrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

Cute testing ground we've got.  All responses support the propositionthat gun control works.       The question is this:  Did Washington D.C. experiance an increasein its violent and/or gun crime rate which was greater than the patternindicated prior to the implemented gun control laws.  If it did, thenthe suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to"control" did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws.------------------------------------------------------------------------David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the systemand make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.

Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church  leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach  was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the   BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces   of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds  played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them   they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was  evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up   a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving   relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'  childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender  seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.---peter

One that I have held for sometime.  We do notallow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire.  Even withheterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge andinformation about sexuality and relationships.It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positiveview of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitlythat they are wrong and immoral. The concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalismand fear- these fears cover a wide range, but mostly jealousy and lack of trustseem to be cornerstones of modern day American relationships.  We also set ontop of this the concepts of Madison Avenue attractiveness and standards and putthe pressure on to measure up.

 72FURY OF MOTHER NATUREMan's contribution to environmental "pollution" are paltry compared to those of nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, "all of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the industrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three volcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and Hekla in Iceland in 1947." To which could be added Mount St. Helens in Washington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into the stratosphere).LOS NINOSMany environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global warming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a natural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive currents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's weather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for thousands of miles.CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: "Cold water along the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped Bangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the U.S. resulting in drought."TERMITE TERRORSundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental "degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in "the Netherlands... manure from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred the landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are ravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage standing forrests."The February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that "an international team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the Carbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does." According to a study reported in SCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the "estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil fuel combustion." In addition, "Termites are a potentially important source of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global emmisions." The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.Ants are another natural source of "pollution." In 1987, an atmospheric chemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the globe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the rain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT magazine, the "ants release the acid when defending themselves and communicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about  the acid the ants release," an amount estimated at "600,000 metric tons annually." which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation."Clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a "despoiler" of the environment.By Robert W.

 17I'd like to conduct a small survey relating to Americans' views on economics and on Japan.The survey consists of just two questions.  I ask that only Americans respond; I've postedit worldwide, however, because I think others will be interested in the results.  I'lltabulate the results and post them with some commentary.  Please respond by email to"borden@m5.harvard.edu".  Here are the questions:1) As an American, would you prefer that in a given year, a) our economy grows by one   percent, and Japan's economy also grows by one percent, or b) our economy grows by   two percent while Japan's economy grows by three percent?2) On what newsgroup did you read this survey?Thank you for your participation.  - Dave Borden    borden@m5.harvard.edu

"So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd neverend up with a guy anyway."  As several people on soc.bi pointedout to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationshipsor just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gayculture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easilyfind yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you sochoose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just fromhanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once aweek, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out inbars or something.)So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless ofcourse you're trying to date a random sample of the US population.As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic,and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay malesare sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they'recloseted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up genderroles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've*all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going tobe more sex.  Or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up"is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males.(also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous,but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavilycloseted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex withstrangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,and be monogamous or nearly so...)--                                                                       ____Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu)  Email, 'talk' always welcome.  \\bi/Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon   \\/B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+

It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted toalt.conspiracy.Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than themore common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under atleast 2 misconceptions:1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to    imply.  And, even if it was, so what?  It would not have melted    anyway.darinwilkins@scubed.com________________________________|                              || I will be President for food ||______________________________|

The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one.And in these times of economic difficulty, the Washingtonlegislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from$4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents overOregon's).It would seem to me that this increase does notkeep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should beto $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raisethe minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then givea 10% cost of living increase every 4 July.and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country clubrepublican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people.chuspyotr-- pyotr@halcyon.com Sometimes Pyotr Filipivich, sometimes Owl.

 93The following statement was releasedon February 27,1992 by the Science &Environmental Policy ProjectAs independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are concerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, being developed by environmental and  activists groups and certain political leaders. This so called "Earth Summit" is scheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on the population of the United States and other industrialized nations.Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We do not agree. A survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, confirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past century. A recently published research paper even suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar activity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880.Futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models.Finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on world food supply.We are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent changes in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences falling on developing countries and the  poor.David B.

 16SPEAKING OF VAT:  Did anyone see CNN's report yesterday (4/15)?  It was quite hillarious (no pun intended).  They ran down how a percent taxwas added at each stage of manufacturing, graphicaly depicting a stack of quarters being added at each wholesale stage.

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-systemas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smallerpercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almostwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take mattersinto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved inreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what itwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income forrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.Some 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degreesin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%unemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a usedcar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else youcould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save andnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,no entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you'vesaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring yourkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missourioutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's anexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on otherpeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Alsobuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleepingin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They reallydo put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough tostart with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livableproperty.

Extra is kept forthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land thatsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plantcrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. Ifyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing agood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow somethingelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into thepublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places withanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute theuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficientto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger houseand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vowto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairnesssubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost nomore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down adeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a largerhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business planand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the publicgood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep andmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary inservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be dividedamong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to validoperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavymachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Theircouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn'tso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do isrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's arigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system couldbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have beenmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off themerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that convertedyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the oneswho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent whenyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged butkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for apoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifyingthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feedtheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have beenenslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now weare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to ownland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing toown it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!I have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I knowwhat I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will belet out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her tolive on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewiseenslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can makethings just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as shedestroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, andtheir heirs. That would be worth it. Then to be able to die before they cando anything to me. That's a poor man's dream. Sleep tight, bastardlandlords.

You have to ask the insurer: "Would my policycover an abortion?" to find out.  If it does, you should have aright to decline that "coverage" if YOU DON'T WANT IT.The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for thecoverage YOU WANT.  If basically you want "catastrophic coverage"you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondinglyLOWER premium).  Similarly, you don't have to be COMPELLED totake on a policy covering things like liposuction or hairtransplantation, if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE, again,at a corresponding savings to you.If you don't want to be "covered" for abortion, you should not beCOMPELLED to.  To millions of Christians, abortion is not a"gynocological examination" or a "pap smear."  To them abortionis murder.  To them, being "covered for abortion" means that theyare paying for a "service," which THEY THINK IS EVIL, CLEARLYDON'T WANT, and will NEVER USE.  In such a case, all that ishappening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHERPEOPLE'S abortions.When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT andwill NEVER USE, this is called extortion.When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to "buy" a "juke-box" forthe owner's "protection" this is called racketeering. And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing adefacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion, by promising tohelp pay for other people's abortions (when one is clearlyopposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu

If it is not temporary,>let's hear it.Who gets to keep what parts of Judea and Samaria will be determined ina peace settlement.  Obviously, Israel will keep some, and the Arabswill get some.Israel has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuckwith it.  It has been refused by the Arabs several times.  Althoughthere are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, Iseriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in anysettlement.The Golan Heights is a serious security problem, and Israel obviouslywill have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (One shouldremember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was tobe in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewishstate, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.  Inother words, it is an historical accident that it was ever part ofSyria.)-- Alan H. Stein                     astein@israel.nysernet.org

Or are the allegations just part of the Big> Cover-Up?Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of beinga Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get aconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the "fundy" part as theterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer tothose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God andwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does itmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have beensatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruellingstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge youto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assumethat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and hisright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspectof the tragic events of the past few days.Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to thefederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molestinginfants so it must be true even though such allegations do notfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they arestate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at thelocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge havingever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocentas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At leastthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as alustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates mightbring upon him.  But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left thebuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examinedby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuseand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met withDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported thatthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koreshis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of amost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the Onewho has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess lefton earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strongmessage to the government to respect the inalienable rights of thepeople it serves.--Joe Gaut> > (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't> put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

PDT            Q  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)          THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)          Q  The first is that this is the meeting of the Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What are the priorities, because there are several association of Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment?            This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not very enthusiastic?  Thank you.          Q  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.          THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have some influence over the distribution of.            With regard to your second question, let me say that I would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole history of America, any kind of aid program has always been unpopular.            What I have tried to tell the American people is, is this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on our side and on the Russian side.            So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an investment for the United States.  This is very much in the interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country.            Russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful investment.            Like all investments, there is some risk.  But there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the Cold War.          Q  Mr. President, first of all thank you very much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind of a very measured breakthrough.            I have two questions.  One, in your introductory remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions inherited from the Cold War?            PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and we agreed to continue to press that.          I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, but that, in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join the NPT regime is critical.          What was the second question?            THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the leadership of the Congress.          With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be much less.          With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future.          Q  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the last part of your speech?          THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as I could about your history.            And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a personal feeling about Russia.            I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it occurred.            These are things that have always had a big impact on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)          THE PRESS:  Thank you.                               END3:06 P.M. PDT

The second fire starts in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high.The flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this firestarting.Thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separatelocations. The FBI report a third. I was not able to verify it from thevideotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behindthe small tower in the second (flag on left) camera angle.The flames coming out of the building are yellow/orange. This is thenormal colour for carbon compounds burning. The flames were those of a solid or confined liquid burning, not of a gas exploding. The explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not anexplosive though. The cloud itself is on fire. This would seem tobe most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather thanthe explosion of a magazine.|>Funny, how considering there was to be a great cache of explosives|>ammunition, etc in the compound, I did not see any series of explosions.Depends entirely on how they were distributed. You would not be ableto identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coveragefrom a mile away. If and when the FBI release pictures from cmerason the armoured vehicles (which presumably exist) it might be possible to get a clearer picture. If anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies thenremember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs.Just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenadesgoing off. Since the building was designed to be blast proof to someextent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off fromthe collapse of the building due to the fire.|>And, oops, the automatic weapons were probably burnt up in the fire|>with the other witnesses.Paranoia.|>Unless, I see videotapes showing the davidians starting the fire, I|>guess I may have a problem believing the feds saying they saw them|>doing it, but couldn`t or didn`t manage to tape it.

EDT          Q  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's protest today?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.  I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game.  So, I think it's good.          Q  Do you think they're moving fast enough?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.          Q  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture?          THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it.            And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

What you say is true, butthe law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has tomake *some* assumptions.

Certainly, I would needa preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that therewas a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.The number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding,the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.

The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,that doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.Dealing Coke -- DeathDealing Heroin -- DeathDealing Pot -- DeathDealing Crack -- DeathThe list goes on and on!!!......JUST KIDDING!!!However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, "spend it to educate people", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  things like drug treatment programs.I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually prescribe and addict his "recommended" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,or cut the amount down to levels where it is "acceptable".  Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.The 60 Minute Report said it worked with "cocaine" cigarettes, pot and heroin.Ryan

EDT     Q  Mr. President, President Havel is here for the Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  All this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision-making process as far as Bosnia is concerned?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the Holocaust is the most extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  And I think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that should be opposed.  You couldn't help thinking about that.  That's not to compare the two examples.  They're not identical; everyone knows that.  But I think that the United States should always seek an opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against inhumanity.          Q  Sir, how close are you to a decision on more sanctions on Bosnia?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, of course, we've got the U.N. vote.  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  And we now are putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at what other options we ought to consider.  And I don't have anything else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on it and will continue to over the next several days.          Q  Following your meeting today, sir, are you any closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there?          THE PRESIDENT:  I have not made any decisions.                                      * * *                                              Q  President Clinton, why have you decided to meet with Mr. Havel?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm just honored that he would come and see me.  I'm glad he's here in the United States for the dedication of the Holocaust Museum.  He is a figure widely admired in our country and around the world, and a very important person in Europe, and a very important person to the United States.  So I'm hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we believe in.

The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is>an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to>deceive the public.Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presentedhere either.  Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywherefrom .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949.This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in thefirst place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.  Similarly the increase incocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase ofcrack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%.  This doesn't eventake into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded,but it does mean that USA Today has (not surprisingly) provided uswith virtually no information.

I agree this is not a legal matter - consentingadults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh'sbeliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not acivil liberties perspective.  I think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not atRay Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), butat Stephen Tice.--| Steve Watson a.k.a. watson@sce.carleton.ca === Carleton University, Ontario ||  this->opinion = My.opinion;  assert (this->opinion != CarletonU.opinion);  |"Somebody touched me / Making everything new / Burned through my life / Like a bolt from the blue / Somebody touched me / I know it was you" - Bruce Cockburn

Why have>you omitted that level from your model?Yes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn't fully articulate the principles of Fractal Federalism.  All government powers derive from thePeople; each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes that power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the lowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case of higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures.  We canof course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our Constitutional Convention :-).  Once a power has been granted, it may be exercised by the legislature.  Powers not in the original Constitutions must percolate upward, starting from the individual.  The ratification process for the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority.Granting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empoweringthe government at that level to restrict the activities of the governmentsat the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process (again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government structure).This government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read-"liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the governmentto force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on).  It is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- "big-government conservatives").  I personally would rather see those typesof people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and economic) that is going on now.This is IMHO a "good" government stucture for those who see the role ofgovernment as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizingthat individuals need to have some influence in the type of community thatthey live in.>> 2) A free market works on government, not just economics.  Succesful>> ideas propogate, unsuccessful ideas die.>What is your definition of a "successful" idea or a "successful">government?One which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for itspeople, while working within the realities of human nature.  You do bringup the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no meansnecessarily a "successful" idea.  I believe that Fractal Federalism wouldat least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunityto democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas.  If theDocialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters aprosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to  check their thesis.  If Libertopia is possible, it will arise.  If a balancedConservative Republic is democratically received as the best level ofgovernment activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best.>> As far as "set the moral tone" is concerned, if a community does not>> collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of>> their kids, why should they have to?

It's called "freedom.">If they don't like the ideas to which their kids are exposed, they can>try to educate and persuade their kids as to why the things that they're>seeing other people doing are wrong or bad.Right, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- "empower thegovernment") except through the amendment process.  That is how the Federal Government is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the Supreme Court put a stop to that "republican government" nonsense.In my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provisionempowering the government to regulate churches the government (whateverlevel we are talking about) could indeed ban churches.  The constitutionalprovision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provisionprotecting free exercise of religion.  The uppermost Constitution is stillthe Supreme Law of the Land.>(I find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free-market>competition among various ideas, and yet support the right of he>majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don't like.)It is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associationsand environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas.One dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, andthey also need to have some control over their environment.  In my"Fractal Federalism" government, certain "rights" are protected by the constitutions.  Other "rights" are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them.  When a consensus is reachedthat the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringedupon.  This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom,but I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutesare a good idea.I am sure that many parents believe that they have a "right" to controlthe environment that their children live in.  People feel that they havea "right" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances.There are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residentialneighborhoods.  I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individualinstances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view themas the people in a community having some control over the type of communitythat they live in.  I see the alternative as near anarchy.Like I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zeroeffect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the rightto restrict that activity.  There are simply not very many behaviors thatfit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomesan issue of one individual or group having power over another individualor group.  I think that the "Fractal Federalism" approach is a sound, ifnot ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power.  The libertarian scenario degenerates to "might makes right," and the system we have rightnow is one of "lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the Supreme Court.">> The problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the>> fundamental dilemma of democratic government: The People have a right>> to exercise a voice in their community, yet individuals have the right>> to be left to themselves.

I am truly interested if you haveany improvements to make on my ideas (I call them "my ideas", but theyall come from an "average guy" reading of the U.S. Constitution withoutbenefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia).>But I have to say that I think that your solution is at least just as>bad.

When I said that "Fractal Federalism" resembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear.  I should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of governmentpower is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of everyindividual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement).  It is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is thesituation we have now.  That is why I think the Supreme Court should bea jury court, with a different jury for each case.  It is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still find it a repugnant idea?

You have to ask the insurer: "Would my policycover an abortion?" to find out.  If it does, you should have aright to decline that "coverage" if YOU DON'T WANT IT.The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for thecoverage YOU WANT.  If basically you want "catastrophic coverage"you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondinglyLOWER premium).  Similarly, you don't have to be COMPELLED totake on a policy covering things like liposuction or hairtransplantation, if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE, again,at a corresponding savings to you.If you don't want to be "covered" for abortion, you should not beCOMPELLED to.  To millions of Christians, abortion is not a"gynocological examination" or a "pap smear."  To them abortionis murder.  To them, being "covered for abortion" means that theyare paying for a "service," which THEY THINK IS EVIL, CLEARLYDON'T WANT, and will NEVER USE.  In such a case, all that ishappening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHERPEOPLE'S abortions.When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT andwill NEVER USE, this is called extortion.When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to "buy" a "juke-box" forthe owner's "protection" this is called racketeering. And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing adefacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion, by promising tohelp pay for other people's abortions (when one is clearlyopposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) andthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficultfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to mysysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In hisdefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it hasbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directedat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at respondingvia netmail...)While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadminto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every postI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were notwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF IAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have himaxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentumad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would havewanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about andseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).The issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken *off the net* from last year. If reposting an articleconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This postdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If onehad posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complainsto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo andbehold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had anaddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUEITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you senda note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; theyonly get "I don't like what that user is doing because...".Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to themin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks forthe info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts arevery interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying toconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warranta message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted andand this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you havesome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...")NWO Indeed!Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up witha new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer postto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefitfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing sideshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in theprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying thata lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and Iwas just getting started.It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to thecontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on peopleon the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seemsto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who doeshe work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is wellknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account herein the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in theprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybea TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

The trap is the easy way out.For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that thedemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You'regoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnicgroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factorsleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually thannot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very fewBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crimestatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you thenworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireableor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction todefine "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerouswhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rationalhumans.It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racialmakeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live inSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, wehave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularlytroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to theirpropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people onthe street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs andcrime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles lastyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! Iremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobswhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleanedfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relativesthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first trulymulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion thatin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*riot!In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting pointsthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring theracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. Asa people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problembecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I trulybelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our currentcourse of denial and repression.I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,luck in avoiding the "trap".

That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the whole thing -- that kind of screw-up really *would* be embarrassing, wouldn't it?  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory -- we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists of bald-faced liars.  From this we can immediately conclude that they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?  Come on, now, think -- who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration?  The answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it.  That's right -- it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans, of course.  And it worked, too: Clinton immediately backed down on the stimulus package, didn't he?>Still, it is something to think about.Uh huh.  Later he writes:>[...] The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heat>despite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributed>to starting the blaze.  Now I'm getting confused.  Did the tear gas canisters start the fire before or after the lantern, and when was that in relation to when the ATF started it?  Oh, by the way, the story I've been hearing is that no canisters were used, since they didn't want to start a fire (but we of course only have their word on that).As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly persuaded.-- Steve Schaffner        sschaff@unixhub.slac.stanford.eduThe opinions expressed may be mine, and may not be those of SLAC, Stanford University, or the DOE.

Few people know that thePilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and acommon food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered thefirst few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made allproperty common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting cropswent into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradfordprivitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to PerryD. Westbrook:  "The change was immediately justified by the increasedindustry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted."Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  "Theexperience that was had in this common course and condition, triedsundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince thevanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some oflater times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community intoa commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiserthan God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed muchconfusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have beento their benefit and comfort."Bradford did not blame this failure on the "strangers", but on the basicselfishness in all men.  He wrote "seeing all men have this corruption inthem, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them."  In otherwords, according to Westbrook, "Bradford found private enterprise to bethe most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state."Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.

My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmerwho makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,"Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.From where I set, looks like Satan has a three-bagger going.In article <1993Apr20.051902.9472@gw.wmich.edu> x86carnell@gw.wmich.edu writes:>In article <C5rLps.Fr5@world.std.com>, jhallen@world.std.com (Joseph H Allen) writes:>> In article <1qvk8sINN9vo@clem.handheld.com> jmd@cube.handheld.com (Jim De Arras) writes:>>>I'm short of patience tonite, but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  >>>than the BDs got.>> >> Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.

The Branch Davidians opened fire first.It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according tothe FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warningover the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenadesdid so under fire from the compound.>>> >> The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was>> an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.

(likely ?).They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicidecould result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I haveis that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for thecounterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complexwas probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de mainthat the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airlinerswas highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone onas long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options,and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.>>Similarly, why the raid yesterday?

This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are notreally scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, ifone believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, thepredictions of psychological experts were proven false, not underlaboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.2. Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire - we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violentlywith the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find itdifficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a humanreaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian responseeither.3. Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way toescape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewisereal. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.4. The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent childrenand not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It isexceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact.We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make itbetter, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn'tmake it so. There is no meaning to this thing.

 17It is interesting, sometimes, to listen to U.S. news as seen throughthe eyes of another country.......B.B.C. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of London,reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank, whenmaking a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosenelamp and that is how the fire started.  Attempts were made by thepeople inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly.Has anyone in U.S. heard anything similar or are U.S. governmentspin-doctors censoring such information?The B.B.C. news is also reporting that about 20 of those that diedwere british citizens.

You could easily defineequality to regard the property in terms of it's significancefor the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewedtoward poorer people.In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal protection.

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and amdisturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in thismanner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided healthcoverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may losenot only my coverage but even my job.I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that healthinsurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory intheir health insurance program, so that it can be declined, withan appropriate reduction in premium.In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in thehealth benefit packages between those who would choose to haveabortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that youinclude a provision in which the reduction in premium resultingfrom the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to theemployee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  This second provision should serve to dissuade employers frompressuring employees into taking one or the other stand withregard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.

It is the "L" word -LOSER !!That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, itis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mailbuffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, noholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were afew "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, anS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators tocontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never hadit so good. In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that onedoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentlertype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots ofdiscourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winningbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no suggestion of losing.But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our "white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another onewith a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'threeyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapsesin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days. Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwoodused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scottdeclaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser." And so on. The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - andDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some "equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asianhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determinedday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) minority.Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do mostconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't carewho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say somethingabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a "neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limitthe pot.Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to bepopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll stillbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, itis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than anyother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even inColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams inthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men !!

 62The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,1993 issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up At Younger Age" by MikeSnider, p. 1A).    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue    and air fresheners, says a new survey.    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds    "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.    "We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters    adolescence," says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and    Human Services.    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long    decline.    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the    following in the 30 days before they were polled:        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;                         cocaine 0.7%.        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;                         cocaine 0.7%.        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;                         cocaine 1.3%.    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%    over 1991.     * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%    tried it in the last year.    Reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of    strategy" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part    of an overall illness prevention plan.    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders    disapprove of them.    "It's scary," Shalala says.  "Dealers are focusing on younger, more    vulnerable kids."Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

For a real case study in revolution, go to Blockbuster Videoand check out "Underground," a film made about the Weather Underground inthe 70's. Even with all the strife back then, the "revolution" never didcome. And Waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times?In the tape, it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dancearound the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a fewof their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs ina Greenwich village townhouse. The problem, one of them said, was thatthey were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* abouttheir own personal safety and weren't "careful." But of course that was*society's* fault, a society that didn't instill a sense of worth inthe people, so they neglect their own safety.Current apologists for Koresh may pick up some important rationalizationtips from this tape!---Joe Knapp   jmk@cbvox.att.com

Remember what Spock said:"the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".As long as government spending does not contradict the ConstitutionI don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected a group of people to make decisions in one direction. And if this is bad, then we should elect a new government. Democratic systems workthis way, and I don't have anything against you raising an opinionin your case.

EDT               MS. MYERS:  Okay, today's schedule.  As you know, the President jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.            At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the Rose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m., he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00 p.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.          Any questions?          Q  Is he moving towards some major decision this week on Bosnia?          MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss his options.  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll continue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but obviously the situation there is very serious.          Q  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.          Q  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 p.m.?          MS. MYERS:  He did.  He answered a question about it yesterday.          Q  Before anything had happened.          MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.  He put out --          Q  Since something has happened he's had nothing to say.          MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.  And we'll have more to say about it later today.          Q  In what forum is that going to be?          MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.          Q  He will talk about Waco at that?          MS. MYERS:  Yes, he'll have something to say.          Q  Is that something we can take live?     \f     MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.  We can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I don't know if it's something you'd want to take live.          Q  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as well?          MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.          Q  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the Attorney General?          MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know that he hasn't talked to her this morning.          Q  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or anyone else?          MS. MYERS:  No.          Q  And he didn't talk yesterday?          Q  What's the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night?          MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she answered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of asking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her 100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind Attorney General Reno.          Q  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of that, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed, et cetera?          MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about the decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led to her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision to go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.          Q  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back now, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened?          MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is lost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the decision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was informed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 percent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the FBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone on for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.            This was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the ground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving forward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the best possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-guessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --          Q  Why not?  They have to --     \f     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I think it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  I think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, it's not useful.          Q  You sound like he's going to order an investigation of what happened and whether --          MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that later, yes.          Q  He will order an investigation?          MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to say about an investigation.          Q  What kind of investigation?          MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.          Q  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely there is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right decision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather -- a debacle.          MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, again, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.          Q  What was the FBI Director's role in this?          MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting up the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke to the President, but I'll double-check that.          Q  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth?          MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what aspects he was involved with.          Q  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House today?          MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe that she'll be here.          Q  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?          MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.          Q  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of -- to the President's detriment politically?          MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I think, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate the facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \fchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome.          Q  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling the, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was talking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at Justice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of thing?          MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening there.          Q  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the President, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to anybody at the White House.  So who --          MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-staff level.          Q  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department was handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?          MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked to a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a number of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number of conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to keep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the day.          Q  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he talked -- he may have at one point.          Q  And was the White House role just to seek information about what happened, or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed?          MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation so the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice Department managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the President was following it very closely throughout the day.          Q  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet Reno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?          MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her this morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  He's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written statement.          Q  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday?          MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've spoken this morning.\f          Q  No, yesterday.          Q  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday.          MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that he stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that Janet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they could, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the time.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 1,000 percent.          Q  One of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her.          MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken this morning.          Q  Why can't we find out?          MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here right now.          Q  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do is pick up the phone.          MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.          Q  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the Davidians?          MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  Again, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.          Q  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was happening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?          MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She informed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't know how much clearer we can be about that.          Q  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the responsibility.          MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.          Q   Does okay mean --     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate responsibility.          Q  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's going to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the administration?          MS. MYERS:  No.     \f     Q  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation?          MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday.          Q  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held?          MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.          Q  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  One that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had a bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  What do you know about those two --          MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts this morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know -- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the compound.          Q  Has the President received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've been able to find out on in the compound now?          MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that they've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it to cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported in the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.          Q  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney General Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so-called experts?          MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands behind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of her advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he supports that.          Q  What about the validity of the decisions made on the ground?  Does he back those --          MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions made.          Q  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the decision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the President says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the decision?          MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed about the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it.          Q  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the decision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --          MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department and FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision and then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the chain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The operation went forward, and the President accepts full responsibility.     \f     Q  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to go back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that came through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement?  What was his involvement?          MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General and the Director.          Q  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?          MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many different ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by the Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney General in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, I want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you know, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about those decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to it, and he accepts full responsibility.          Q  Do you have, based on what you know here at the White House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during this --          MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.          Q  Along those same lines, just in your initial review of the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?              MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do with it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went forward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.          Q  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to Clinton?          MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I think she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.          Q  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed on the situation in Waco?          MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a daily basis.          Q  Who briefed the President?          MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, what conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on the events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.          Q  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a White House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?          MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House staff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects.          Q  Another subject?          Q  On another subject.     \f          Q  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)          MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.          Q  How close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty?          MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech on Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.          Q  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?          MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where yet.          Q  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would you characterize the speech tomorrow?          MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day speech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past positions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much into what he's going to talk about tomorrow.          Q  On or off campus?          Q  Is this at a location outside the White House?          MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We don't know exactly where yet.          Q  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia?           MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.          Q  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today -- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, that the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on?          MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of Eastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.          Q  Is that a question they're going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?          MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of options, including the peace plan.          Q  Does the group that he's meeting with today include Reg Bartholomew?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be among the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General Powell.          Q  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent encounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating the no-fly zone?          MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.\f          Q  Will the President be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?          MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.          Q  As a group, or one by one?          MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here.          Q  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been worked out for him to address the march on Sunday?          MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact details of that.          Q  Not a live phone hook-up?          MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting to Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to the other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on it.          Q  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?          MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.          Q  Do you know what it's on?          MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --          Q  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  When will he be meeting with the President?          MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll talk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.          Q  So he's not going to come immediately to the White House?          MS. MYERS:  No.          Q  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?          MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.          Q  Drug czar?          Q  Do you expect it before the march?          MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.          Q  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.          Q  Why not?          MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\f          Q  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?          MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.          Q  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --          MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on amendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is committed to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up.          Q  When this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to Janet Reno?          MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.          Q  It's become a pressing question for the last several hours.          MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, and I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.          Q  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?          MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered a compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the best alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a second look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that today, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the Mitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.          Q  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that will be at the march on Sunday?          MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the President.  I don't know who yet.          Q  Well, has it been decided how he's going to address?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?          MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but there hasn't been a final decision on that yet.          Q  The official will read the letter, is that what it sounds like?          MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you know what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?          MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come up, but it was about economic issues.          Q  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the target?          MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.          Q  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress speech at the end of May --          MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the President will present the health care plan to the people.  I wouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.                                 END10:08 A.M. EDT

Nonetheless, I decided to providea number of references to support my original argument. Black's LawDictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawfulsexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawfulknowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The ModelPenal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissionersof Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wifeis guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat ofimminent death....

This is possible. Officialsin higher positions than hers have been duped. We have no choice sowe may as well give her another chance. Even if she is truly evil,it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time.I'm considering joining the NRA.Finally, I have one question: What happened to the Federal agents thathad supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization (andstarted this whole debacle)?-------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QEDDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.The early bird got worms.
 11In regard to Woody's post, I thought I would remind him of something inthe midst of his tirade against academia:As a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve (NOT!) Ithink we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow usto directly address the problems of the gigantic federal deficit and debt andcontinue to allow our economy to expand--and I don't remember Woody and co.complaining about academia while Laffer implemented his policy, Stockmanapproved it while being fully aware the numbers not adding up, and Reagancompleting the largest con job of the century which my generation and I will now have to pay for.

If I were representing Mr. Teel, >I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one, or recommend >he plea-bargain.  He's setting himself up to be in hot water.Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various thingsMr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) thosewho win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to theirclaim, and (2) those who lose.Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seencited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in theshow and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says thatan individual has to file a return.Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcastthe next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended topeople who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offerfor Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, andso Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against aclaim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do withthe tax code.--Tim Smith

 164From: New Liberation News Service <nlns>Subject: NLNS: Fascism with a Friendly Face/* Written  8:33 pm  Apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news *//* ---------- "NLNS Packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93" ---------- */Fascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of Anyone?Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that Hitler was original and showed initiative." --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, October 27, 1992.(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was independent and sharp as a scalpel.My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery.Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt.The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days.)Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a RICO indictment.On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For example:On Their Own Qualifications to Control SocietyHitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" (page 577).Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)On Religion as the Basis of a NationHitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ...

(Page 581.)Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social CollapseHitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. They disparage American heroes."

We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)*     *     *To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America.And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

Thus itis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directedfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the politicallessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.In article <1993Apr14.121823.21851@oneb.almanac.bc.ca>, kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (Ken Mcvay) writes:|>As Dawidowicz points out, in "The Holocaust and the Historians," (Harvard |>University Press, 34-38):|>|>"...the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving's "Hitler's|>War."<34> An amateur historian, whose reputation as a German apologist and|>as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of|>notoriety, <35> Irving produced a 926-page work intended to show that Hitler|>was kind to his animals and to his secretaries, that he was "probably the|>weakest _leader_ Germany has known in this century," and that he did not|>murder the Jews or even wish to do so, but that the murder was committed|>behind his back, without his knowledge or consent." Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Doesthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murderbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardentsupporter?One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the systemwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI partyitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there wasnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did notoriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within ituntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler renegedupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced theold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implicationsof their rhetoric. This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies mustbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal ofhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,the gas chambers of Auschwitz.The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man wholead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was theevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an egocult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not howevermean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he andhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism canproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction betweena govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only thelatter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are madenecessary by an essential weakness.It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were theyamoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in thesame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the causeof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in theirlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such partiessuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assertthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocatesof a system that would commit genocide. The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil isinescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not letthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas thatwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils ofthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticalydoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally madethe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also createsa dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For manyin government politics is a method of providing a justification fortheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since thecontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of theessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoliwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is importantto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the rightand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcementof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism throughtheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamicsof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. Theleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only doso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression ofones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermorein taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the wholebefore personal concerns, even of personal security.Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatredand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commitgenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member ofthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibilityof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot affect the system.Phill Hallam-BakerPhill Hallam-Baker

The FBI andthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to theirstupidity and lies.    Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and intotown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, theydidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they gotit.After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they werecoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According tothem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raisedKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                  The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper hesaid:"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raiseDavid Koresh."Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on alogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming thatthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something mustbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about howmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the "Justification" partpart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.But, back to the plan.  It is considered "Cruel and Unusal Punishment" toexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were notsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children weresupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that trainingis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children weresubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind ofthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave thesepeople 51 days.  I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this wholething that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Rickschanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that theoperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federalshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt."It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automaticweapons on the premises.                                                               HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!I hope he gets it.

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuctioncoverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murderfor reasons of conscience.

Or are wegoing to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support ofabortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one'sconscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.eduPS Sure read through the two short form letters I posted at the beginningof this post.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ``a massive spying operation.''      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately  available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official  sources.  It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as  other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and  his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.  ...........  js

The Hirgun, and other branch -   off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of   Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of   terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the   Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British   soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.The Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwantedfogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families orsuch (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also werekilled sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks ofthe Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried tojustify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the armyat one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.   In addition, they   massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing   to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their   very lives.Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't havereffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away,most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to befighters being killed.Those "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if nothounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period.   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part   Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the   Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the   Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the   Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for   German and European anti semitism.What do you mean "screwed over by the Jews"?

If the FBI hadhad the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando typeraid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Insteadhe ordered the murder of the children.In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleivethe words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account giventhe BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were metby gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporterclaim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heaviergrade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposesthey were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D werequite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at anytime. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could haveachieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanesand Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualtiesthan 80.Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the seriousrisk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby overa prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally preparedKoresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than goin prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.Can you think of a better way of getting the children out?A 100% certain way?The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entiregovernment story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would requirethem to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to comeup with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided toset out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow themto get gun control legislation through.This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of itsagents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in themiddle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend thatWACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which itcould be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, itrests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particularthe person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATFagents and 17 children on his or her conscience.There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of societypreach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are thevery people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACOmay not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter groupof the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for exampleand holding several hundred children hostage.The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to preventthem arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high powerweaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiahto set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.Phill Hallam-Baker

Apologies to those who'veseen the following before:]To explain my position on the "War On Drugs," I offer this:Drugs And Crime: A New Approachby Ken BarnesGiven that:1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation.2. People who want drugs (particularly people who are predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get them, whether or not they are legally available.3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs are readily available to those who want them.4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country, and this occurs in a variety of ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are unable to learn, to the spread of disease among addicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking.5. A general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of, and whatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most effective in confronting the nation's drug problem, some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive.While this country's current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking, and designated-driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be said for the "war" on illegal drugs.  There remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, processors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks and their "marketing activities," which include drive-by shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, and smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day.Clearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are linked.  It takes only a moment's reflection to recognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption, a black market has been created, in which greedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a bygone era, have profited enormously from their illegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug users themselves.Were it not for the black market, and the violent monopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be the thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most  would be, I believe, simply people with a problem, either a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a criminal problem.Let me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of Prohibition off the hook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine, or any other presently illegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users, until "the land of the free and the home of the brave" looks like a police state.Here then is my proposal:1. Possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them remains illegal.  'Potheads' can grow their own marijuana (as many already do today), other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops.2. Because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users, the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy them?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek to sell these "noncommercial" drugs even at relatively low prices.  Therefore,3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell, and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices.  But here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their victims.4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be institutionalized until they are clean, and only then will they begin to serve their sentence.  If they choose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they can begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences.5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes:Drug using criminals (and this includes drunk and/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their sources of supply, thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large, and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business.Institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out, before becoming part of the general prison population.While helping protect society from crime, institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals, since drug using criminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up.Institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease, with the potential to benefit both themselves and others.6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves, and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be more readily identifiable, since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test, or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them.  Declining to take the test, they would of course face stiffer penalties.  While each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of a suspect's drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution.7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, noncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money generated should be used to combat their use.  Enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however, and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users, since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing Prohibition.Instead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations, they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession.Revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising campaigns, and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment.8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated.While my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm drugs have on our society, particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we remain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, and freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always have a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking, the results are the same: needless suffering and death.  As a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs, as we are already doing (regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users.  By taking the profits out of their deadly trade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations.The question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you're talking about.  Different drugs have different effects, and some are more addictive than others.  The addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals, and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot resist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as heroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone, others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer.For those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own, we may argue that because they have chosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on their part, or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life.  But for the addicts, while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the time they discover their addiction it is too late.  We cannot hold them responsible for their disease, any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim.  Perhaps they should have known not to go near the water, or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger, but in their present circumstances warnings will not help.  Neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights. --Standard disclaimer-- *.x,*dna***************************************************************(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg.      * Conservative libertarians     ** \\'  KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu    *      for Pro-Balance!         **(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com**********************"I find television very educating.

 32I don't want to attack anyone's personal opinions and thus have notincluded any articles - but it seems to me incredibly ridiculousand pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsightand point fingers at Clinton, Reno, the FBI, or whomever.First of all, it is a knee-jerk judgement.  The facts are quitemuddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while.Secondly, things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatoryfingers.  Pointing fingers is a destructive action.  If everyonesat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get doneand nothing would ever get any better.  And despite the tragedy,we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a constructive manner.  Doesn't it seem that working together ismore productive than working against one another?Thirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame giventhe benefit of hindsight - something that those who made thedecisions did not have the benefit of.  Why not give them the courtesyof acknowledging that they did the best they could with thedata they had - in a very, very difficult situation.  Someresponses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were donewithout regard for the lives of the people in the compound - giveme a break.Be part of the solution - not the problem.And that's MY opinion -david

However, the Founding Fathers(Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it theirlife's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroytheir great experiment... a democratic republic.I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's andMadison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's "(something)andRemonstrance", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells:-( ].  IMHO, Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American'swho ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jeffersonwas a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than theircontemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modernpoliticians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't knowabout y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give memental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending acopy of it.)--In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for onepeople to dissolve the political bands which have connected them withanother, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate andequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitlethem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that theyshould declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are createdequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienableRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit ofHappiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are institutedamong Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive ofthese ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on suchprinciples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shallseem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence,indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not bechanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experiencehath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils aresufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to whichthey are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce themunder absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, tothrow off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their futuresecurity.Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such isnow the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systemsof Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is ahistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in directobject the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  Toprove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent shouldbe obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attendto them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of largedistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right ofRepresentation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them andformidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their publicRecords, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance withhis measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing withmanly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to causeothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable ofAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers ofinvasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for thatpurpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, andraising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing hisAssent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure oftheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms ofOfficers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without theconsent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior tothe Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign toour constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent totheir Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring    Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into    these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protectionand waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, anddestroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries tocomplete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begunwith circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilizednation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seasto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners oftheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavouredto bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless IndianSavages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destructionof all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress inthe most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered onlyby repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by everyact which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a freepeople.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and    settlement here.We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow    these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections    and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice     and of consanguinity.We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our    Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies     in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, inGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of theworld for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by theauthority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare.

Carmel "camp" on Monday.Neither is Atty. General Reno.  The issuance of tear gas might have not beenthe best idea to achieve the extrication of the Branch Davidians, butprevious attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had said that this was to end asap.One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this. Vernon Howell aka David Koresh. It was he who issued the order to start shooting at the BATF agents when they went to serve the arrest warrant on Feb 28. It was the Davidians who KILLED four law enforcement agents, and injured several others. It was Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the legalities in a court of law, with a jury of 11 citizens. (note: I can't saya jury of his peers, as his writings indicate that he thought that he was Jesus. It would be pretty difficult to find that many self-appointed prophets in the North Texas area.)As for who started the fires in the building, there have been numerous localnews reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in facttheir own people were starting the fires.  Once again, it wasn't Reno, or Clinton who lit the matches in this. It was Vernon Howell. The only people in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze,as they had no choice in the matter.

He will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David.           On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave Camp David and fly to Boston.  He'll leave from Hagerstown.

MYERS:  He's going to meet there with a group of citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at around 1:30 p.m.  We're still working out the final times.          Q  At the airport?          MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.       And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And then after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that's it for the weekend.          Q  Has the President seen the report from -- or the letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is his reaction to their call on him?          MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to Secretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their views.  He believes it's an important part of the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.          Q  What is the President's reaction?          MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.  It was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't there before.  And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned about the situation in Bosnia.          Q  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk officers --          MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I think that that is clearly part of the process.  It's something -- their views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who work closely on the issues.          Q  What do you mean, there are options on the table that weren't there before?          MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being considered.          Q  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?          MS. MYERS:  Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador Albright and the President.  But I think the President has said he would certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He's had a number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build some consensus there.            Q  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today?          MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today.          Q  Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action?          MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies at this point.  He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with its allies on this.          Q  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already to take unilateral action?          MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our allies to make sure that we get it.          Q  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?          MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering additional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday were quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The President is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President Clinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to isolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we're considering other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's not enough.          Q  In terms of what you were just talking about, it sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to protect humanitarian --          MS. MYERS:  I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word justify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that's just an explanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action.          Q  The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You're declining to do that this morning.          MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.          Q  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which has been said before explicitly.          MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.  The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.          Q  One other little question.  Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  Secretary Christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President has not seen it.          Q  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --surely, he must have brought that up --          MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about it, but --          Q  Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright recommendation has been rejected, is that correct?          MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.  I said I won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or communications.          Q  She's advocating unilateral action and you're saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.          MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have recommended.          Q  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to that?          MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being considered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter.          Q  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on --additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do?          MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy review underway now.  And the President and his advisors are considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a through review underway, and that their opinions are being very seriously considered.          Q  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this bolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't need right now?          MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate.  It's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.          Q  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the President -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line?          MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome.          Q  Does the policy review include what Madeleine Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --          MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.          Q  The unilateral option is on the table?          MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.          Q  We've had two different --          Q  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?          Q  That would be a change of policy.          Q  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which has been specifically ruled out.          MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  I don't -- that is not --          Q  Are you talking about all options?          MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has been fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he has said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground troops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the beginning.          Q  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?          MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now.  I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked about in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The options being presented and considered are very complicated.          Q  Air strikes on the table?          MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that's been fairly clearly pointed out that that's something that's being discussed.          Q  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the --           MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.          Q  You said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is on the table.  We're confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?          MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this.          Q  Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they don't go along --          MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies on this.  He's continuing to have discussions.  He's continuing to press them for further action.  And I think that's clear.  The conversation is ongoing.  We're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this.          Q  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the Bosnians --          MS. MYERS:  I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I mean, I'm not sure who you're referring to.          Q  The British and the French.          Q  Yes, the British and French.  They've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the U.S. believe differently from that?          MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action.  And I think that process is ongoing.          Q     the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they do not want to do anything.          MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That's all I can tell you at this point.          Q  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference?          MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press conference.          Q  What is the intention?          MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.  He may have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That will not happen.          Q  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is?          MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we are.          Q  After the first hundred days, you mean?          MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.  I mean, this is just generally.  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.          Q  Do you know what the opening statement is?          MS. MYERS:  But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review.  But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not meant to be.  It's just to take questions.          Q  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on.          MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take questions, it's not completely resolved yet.          Q  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, would be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what's the delay on that?          MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think we said it would happen soon.  I don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I don't anticipate that happening today.          Q  What's the delay?  Isn't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.  I think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement.          Q  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn't her appointment announced here?          MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don't know if there's a specific list; I'll have to check and see.  I think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service.  I think there's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, which is Admiral William Crowe.          Q  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government job?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people ever had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected in the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the President believes she's a very competent person.  He's said that -- Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on the President's Foreign Intelligence --          Q  You said she never went up there for a hearing?          Q  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws?          MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Senate.          Q  So you don't think that is any problem?          MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.          Q  She has been appointed to this board, is that a fact?          MS. MYERS:  Yes.          Q  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need confirmation to be a member of the --          MS. MYERS:  No.  It's a presidential appointment.          Q  Usually, announcements are made here at the White House.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?          MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.  People who asked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn't make an official announcement.  If anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names.          Q  I'd like to know.          Q  Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a  matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension?          MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I'm happy to put this out.          Q  Isn't that the standard practice?          Q  That was past practice.          MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.  We'll put out a list of the members of the board today.          Q  Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely?          MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we're happy to put that out today.          Q  What is the board, what is her title, what is the size of the board?          MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the board.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that board is Admiral William Crowe.          Q  And did he recommend Baird?          Q  What's the name of the board?          MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, PFIAB.          Q  What's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) --           MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke?          Q  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn't this appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago?          MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.            Q  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?          MS. MYERS:  She's an experienced attorney, someone who the President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that is not the board's mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously talented and has said that throughout.          Q  Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?          MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.  On December 24th, when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I don't believe there's ever been any --          Q  Earlier than that, during the transition.          MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.  It was announced, again, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was announced.           Q  Are members paid?          MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.          Q  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it's the Texas Ranger reports.            MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.  Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet holes.  I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice Department is looking into it.          Q  Is the President going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of this?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know that he's going to try to mediate the dispute.  I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work together.           Q  Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything?          MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you on that.          Q  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech?          MS. MYERS:  It's going to be fairly general.  I don't think it's going to be any specific announcements.  I think it's going to be sort of a --          Q  Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about?          MS. MYERS:  We're still working on it.  But I wouldn't look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like that.          Q  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my excellent adventure for 100 days"?  (Laughter.)          MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little bit broader look about what's happened in the last --          Q  Foreign, domestic?          MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of domestic.          Q  And overview.           MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific policy announcement.              Q  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday?          MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.          Q  Is that available?          MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure.          Q  Are you going to put it out here or --          MS. MYERS:  We'll probably put it out here on Sunday.          Q  Travel next week?          MS. MYERS:  Unclear.          Q  What was the question?          Q  Likely?          MS. MYERS:  I don't --          Q  Likely?  Possible?          MS. MYERS:  Possible.          Q  What's possible?          MS. MYERS:  Travel.          Q  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have days yet for them?          MS. MYERS:  Not yet.          Q  Can you tell us which order?          MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national service later in the week.          Q  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?          MS. MYERS:  No.          Q  And any report in the aftermath of the day?          MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?          Q  Readout.          MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Jeff Eller will be down there.  I think he can go through what the President did during the day.  We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure here in the morning.          Q   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.  In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice?          MS. MYERS:  Twice.          Q  Why this weekend?          MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on the way home from his father-in-law's funeral.  I think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family.  And this is just an opportunity to do the same.          Q  There's no march there.          Q  It has nothing to do with the march here?          MS. MYERS:  No.          Q  Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) --          MS. MYERS:  He'll fly straight to Boston.          Q  Flying straight did you say?  (Laughter.)          Q  George took a question yesterday on Waco.  The President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the FBI.  And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas.  Do you have an answer on that?          MS. MYERS:  I don't.  I'll check.          THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                 END10:59 A.M. EDT

What is your proof that they "did the best they could"?   Unless  they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger  then "the best they could" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT.  Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a  strong possibility of it.  I, for one, said that in the event of  an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger  either from the assault itself or from a "Jonestown" (my phrase  a week after the seige started) style suicide.  And as I pointed  out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net   who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they  have no right to impose this choice on their children.  Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I   have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their  own or to take the advice of experts.  The cult specialist inter-  viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly "stonewalled"  by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational  tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so   increased the chance of a tragic outcome.>Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were>done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give>me a break.  Give *US* a break!   Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound   filled with CHILDREN?!!   This doesn't seem to show much regard for   their lives or safety.   "Nontoxic teargas" is an oxymoron.  Children  have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions  induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone  subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease.  If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the   madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the  death of the hostage as the madman himself.  These kinds of situations  have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with  tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud-  speakers at all hours.   That approach is idiotic.  >Be part of the solution - not the problem.  The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the "the authorities".  The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the  past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more  trouble than they prevent.    Their confrontational approach reinforced  every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee-  ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed  willingly.   This was pointed out here, on Compuserve, in the press,  just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems  a n.i.h. philosophy prevails.              ---peter

There is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas.  Tear gas is non-breathable    remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually    by siezures and death.  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people    they exposed??  Any potential heart problems among the B-D's??2.  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister??  Tear gas is produced by burning a    chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a     warning printed on the side of it.  "Contact with flamable material can result    in fire."  Now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building     they admited was a fire-trap??This whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are heldaccountable.

 25  A Alan Brock 4/14/93 Orange County Register Editorial titled "A case for  repealing the income tax" got my attention.  Some quotes:   "... a tax on income, because of the flexible definition of that   concept, invites the government to snoop into every nook and   cranny of our lives. Encouraging people to snoop on one another   and report transgressions against the almighty state, which most   Americans deplored in Nazi or communist regimes..."    "... Although most Americans paid no income tax at all 50 years ago   -- withholding began only during World War II, as a "temporary"   exigency, and in 1948 the median family federal income tax was $9..."   "Last year the federal government got only 37 percent of its income    from income taxes... How long ago was it that the federal government    somehow managed to stagger along on 63 percent of its 1992 revenue?    ... Would you believe five?..."   "... The income tax has converted a free people into a society of    the fearful and the snitches..."

(yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for anyabortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay forany abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women whohave reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it ontheir own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because ofecononmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortionin the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for anyabortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that thegovernemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.This involves *more money*.Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women whodesire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not wantan abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they cannot afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will beable to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How thenare you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" bythe cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all becausewe remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often usedas an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for justbecause it is desired and can not be afforded.)If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to havean abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for"the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.Why should you pay for someone else's choice?

It is possible that someone inside the community startedthe fire because they "thought" God told them to or because they simplywould rather die than surrender. Who knows? We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Whyhaven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not theyheard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don'tremember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seemsto me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as theyhad promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify theFBI's lying as well?Will an "internal investigation" really reveal what happened, if in factthe BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in thenow-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in acourt of law.There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out whenthe fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed thestairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.Only those in another part of the house escaped.People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came runningout of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather thangoing back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I thinkthe FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically, btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the "evil feds" by any means.

Jamesthe Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier, but there isevidence that the church survived him. There is no evidence that it stillexisted after the assault on the city. The individuals historicallyassociated with that church disappear at that time. 2. The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknamessuggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time (Zealotes,Iscariot, "Sons of Thunder").3. For cult psychology, there's an extensive literature.4. For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalemchurch, there is a mixed collection of sources. The Anchor Bible has someinteresting articles, but one thing I've noticed about biblicalscholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach arenotably lacking. You basically have to spread your net wide and thenwinnow. (For example, Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas,but they were both "over the top.") Many interesting ideas have not beenfollowed up, mostly due to religious reasons. What was the connection ofearly Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and proto-gnosticism? (SeeStephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of thecrucifixion.) Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could beupdated, especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskianmaterials. And so it goes. (For instance, the convincing statisticalevidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has beencompletely ignored by biblical scholars.)I don't track this area much any more. (My coursework is 20 years old.) Ihave a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during thecourse of the Jewish Revolt. I suspect Mark was written before the fall ofJerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Roman-sympathizers off theback of the local Greek Christians. Matthew and Luke were written withsimilar goals, but incorporating additional materials. Given the evidencein the Gospel of Thomas (Chenoboskien), I suspect Q came from a Samaritan(proto-gnostic) milieu. In any case, they were written in an environmentcut off by time or circumstances from Jerusalem, not expecting furthercontact, and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of thedoctrines held by the Jerusalem church.Sorry about the lack of documentation, but the time is hard to find.-- Harry ErwinInternet: erwin@trwacs.fp.trw.comHave found some interesting work...

It's similar to collecting coins,or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or modeltrains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just abouteverything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it somethingof an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;it's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use inhaving TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historicalsignificance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the firstone to do it this way), rarity, and so on.Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, youuse your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of yourcollection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, itcan enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collectfirearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearmsthey collect.  It's just personal preference.Oops, 'personal preference' ... I guess we're not supposed to have that anymore, are we?J.Baker.

Yes, and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that ratherthan hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the next time around.

"private nonprofit foundationshave to make money somehow", and I think that it's about time thatthey acted like the private hospitals that they are.  Personally,I'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone thattheir health care is free when we are actually buying insurance(that's one at you, Bob Rae!!).>>The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total>>outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield >>the 13-14% figure for the U.S.>>But don't the US figures include dentistry and optometry where the >Canadian one (until recently, anyway) didn't?Since we have always been evaluated in an OECD style, I don't seehow ... remember, OECD counts both private and public funds, andin Canada like France and Germany, 30% of health care spending isprivate funds (i.e., not the basic health insurance money).>>>So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.>> >>How?

Remember that our "system"is only an insurance policy.  But our costs aren't rising fastenough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year,Quebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of "$5" asthe necessary hike that could be done through a copayment ratherthan give the QMA a raise.  And it's not contract time yet, asfar as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ...Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from theConservatives with a mildly "libertarian" faction, holds our publichealth insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have tobe reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is morefiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting publicspending all over the place, and bringing back the death penalty, withlittle haste if elected.>I know that, for Pete's sake, I live right on the border.

If provincial governments (as bad as some of themare; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by theConservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible,there is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important thatit's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violentinsurrection outside of the hockey rink.

Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate havinga population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ...and in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakeswith that population or larger.Anyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than thosein the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, suddentransients in spending are unlikely.  In fact, the health allocationis one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so anytalk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border.>If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back, the>things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like>luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable.This won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canadato have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a badthing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments andfrustrate the socialists chanting "Hey, it's *free*!").gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representativesis "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)but in practice is less.

As any entry level political science course will tellyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level ofgovernment to "attack" which presents them with the best chance ofgetting what they want.  With national "interest groups" it is simplya very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact alaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less "contributions" to make.        Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate atthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the littlestate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,medicine, and most other questions.      Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what itshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-localinterests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get theirrules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level becauseit can impose its will on the lower.      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congresof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposedto a local crime?      The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell"it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of "special interests"is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.>|>       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than>|>enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its>|>original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.>>If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current >"no state subsidy motto" they would be better placed.

Iremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capableof educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And ifyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in thatstate.  And since industries can't concentrate their political powerand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and getwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off"states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.>|>       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,>|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically>|>wanted to avoid.

The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they havemore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitutionthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power isharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposingnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried outwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats theentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in differentareas, different solutions may be called for.       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my localand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going tothe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather themajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and endup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off inWashington with half a million or more constituents.

You argued against them,I never argued from them.

Your comparison is a totalfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis inreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assertthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the onehand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather thana hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twinsmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing eachother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describein now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisionsare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations wherethey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claimthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has aclaim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens toits claim?

Whatis different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell thisout for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the onecase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a bornchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetuscan), and in this case you recognize a significant differencebetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are atstake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction areirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inactionanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and haveborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have ahealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat asshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks atparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, andthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntarythan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.Dean Kaflowitz

 48Greetings,    Specious reasoning alert!  Sorry folks, I don't like gun controltoo much, but this is just too crazy.    1)  The main gun control law is similar to (or even BASED ON) aGerman gun control law.    2)  Germany was Controlled With Evil Nazi's at the time.    3)  Nazi's are bad.    Therefore gun control is bad!  (If this seems reasonable to you,try reading it as GunControlIsANaziPlot!  That's pretty much what it'ssaying.)    Look, let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense, not bytrying to appeal to emotions, and threatening conspiracies.  DenounceGCA '68 as wrong because it's WRONG, not because it's based off of alaw from someone else's government.    As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's, So Their LawsHave No Place On Our Books!'  Well, lots of brave men died fightingEngland.  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books?  Oh,but they're our ALLIES now, so everything's hunky-dory.  I'm *VERY*sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books whichis similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  HOWEVER,that does not give invalidation in and of itself.    WE, THE PEOPLE, must state that we find the law unappealing andcontrary to our freedom.  We must use logic, and reason, and compellingarguments.  To use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselvesto the level of your enemies.    A side issue...  When talking about the Amendments, it bothersme to see people acting as if they empower them, but require noresponsibility from them.  Free speech also assumes restraint, wellarmed militia expects well TRAINED militia, the right to vote expectsthe citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonabledecision.

In order for U.S.  industries to>compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't>has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government intothe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  Therewas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support ofstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding wasmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not thatmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers withlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds fortravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and auniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as wellas salary.During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that purescientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This isprobably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to tryto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solutionemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used todiscussion about their problems, the job got done.The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for thefuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress wasunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into thefuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedlykeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,making it more difficult for them to act to support research.The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in whichthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance ofa graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I askfor one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now themoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level itcomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member fromgetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projectsget supported, and how much.  Also, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So insteadof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily researchinstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came intobeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluatingreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposalhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator concealsalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I amproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrowI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright ideawhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach tosomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, itis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than wouldhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the governmentis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.-- Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399Phone: (317)494-6054hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)

Much too big brotherish for my tastes.The drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary, not coerced,and does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V.Those convicted who are drug users, as evidenced by the test,are in need of treatment for their problem.  Institutionalizationof these adddicted criminals is, I would argue, the best way tohelp them straighten out.  If they refuse the test and are convicted,their sentence can be appropriately harsher, since they, unlike theaddict, have no "excuse" for their crimes.> |5.

My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminalbehavior.  If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting aharsher sentence if they are convicted, why is that not a goodthing?  If fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals, BTW)can find victims, why is that not a good thing?  If fewer drugusers, such as drunks, 'potheads,' etc., commit crimes out offear of being cut off from their sources of supply, why is thatnot a good thing?I'm certainly willing to debate my position.You have to read it carefully though.--Standard disclaimer-- *.x,*dna***************************************************************(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg.      * Conservative libertarians     ** \\'  KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu    *      for Pro-Balance!         **(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com********************** "I find television very educating.

The Vice President will take part in the "Kids World Council: Plan It for the Planet" from 2-5 PM (EDT) Saturday (4/17) in Orlando, Florida.  He will tour a display of student environmental projects, then videotape the town hall meeting where he will discuss with student delegates their concerns about the environment and their plans for an environmentally sound future.     The town hall meeting will be moderated by Linda Ellerbee and taped for a news special, "Nickelodeon Special Edition:  Plan It for the Planet," which will air on Sunday, April 18 at 8 PM (EDT).  It is sponsored by Nickelodeon and the Children's Earth Fund.     "Young people care about the environment because they know it affects our future.  Across the country and around the world, young people are speaking out about the environmental challenges we face.  They are identifying problems, thinking about solutions, and they are demanding action from their leaders," the Vice President said.     The Kids World Council delegates are meeting for three days in Orlando to discuss how to save energy and switch to renewable energy.  They will be following the format and goals of the Earth Summit that took place last year in Rio de Janeiro.  The Vice President led the Senate Delegation to the Earth Summit.     "I look forward to hearing what young people have to say about the environment and their future.  Their insight into the world around us is important," the Vice President said.

This was a no win situation,although the final raid was a tragic failure - they should havebeen able to get more people out alive.-MikeP.S.  The title for this thread is ridiculous.  Feds couldn't give a hootabout their religous ideas - weapons was the problem.  Similar situationshave popped up with those "I'm not gonna pay taxes" freaks in Idaho, etc. where religion clearly has no bearing.  Religous freedom here, as an issue,is a complete smokescreen.

THANK you for playing, but obviously you are not reading the   material as it is presented.  According to the report I've got in my   hands, the Newsweek article (which reported that "2 to 3 percent" of the   population is gay) used the criteria of "No heterosexual contact in the   past year."  But at the same time, the University of Denver study points   out, quite dramatically, that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have > had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year. I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual contact of any kind in the previous year, they are counted as heterosexual.Even if they didn't intend it that way, that's how the figures are being used.

EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.            The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.           He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.            This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.          I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.            Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.          Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.          I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.            Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.          Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --          Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --          THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.          Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --          Q  Mr. President --          THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.          Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?          THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.            I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  There were no shots coming back from the government side.          I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:          Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.          Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.            Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.          And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.          So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.          The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.          Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.          Q  Mr. President --          THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.          Q  Can you address the widespread perception --reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?          THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.            There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.          I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)            I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.            But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.          Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?          THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.            There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.          Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.            Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  That's what they thought.          Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?          Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?          THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.          Go ahead, Sarah.          Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?          THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.          Q  What federal laws --          THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.            They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.            In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.          MS. MYERS:  Last question.          Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --          Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?          THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.           What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  That's the first thing I wanted to know.            Thank you.          Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.            She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.            Thank you.

There have been a number of posts defendingthe BD's as some persecuted religous minority, which is sheer bunk.Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term "cult", etc.,but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff.It was a weapons raid.  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's religion, but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic weapons is a threat.  This goes for neo-Nazis and other non-religous groups.So I have this question: If your religious group isn't stockpilingautomatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity, why is thisevent a blow to religious freedom? -MikeP.S. The analogy between BD's and Jews of the Holocaust is so insultingand mind-numbingly stupid I won't even touch it with a ten foot pole.P.P.S.

As a left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing asyou are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor autodealers.  But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other specialinterests cannot influence public policy.

(yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for anyabortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay forany abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women whohave reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it ontheir own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because ofecononmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortionin the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for anyabortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that thegovernemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.This involves *more money*.Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women whodesire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not wantan abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they cannot afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will beable to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How thenare you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" bythe cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all becausewe remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often usedas an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for justbecause it is desired and can not be afforded.)If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to havean abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for"the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.Why should you pay for someone else's choice?  Why should I pay more to*restrict* someone's choice?>(a bunch of other stuff deleted - not related to me :) )>>>>A pro-choice majority would not be enough for one of the two pro-choice>>candidates to win, however a pro-life majority *should* have been enough>>for the only pro-life candidate to win.

I personally think it is >  stupid to vote for someone because of their stance on *one* issue :) .   A pro-lifer who does not consider abortion an *extreemly* important issueis an oxymoron.  If it's not important enough for you to vote the way youfeel because of "other issues", then why should anyone take your insistancethat "abortion is wrong" seriously?>>>                                                      People's perception>>>of the economy and Bush's apparent indifference (coupled with a liberal>>>media) were more likely explanations.  It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*,unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there wouldhave to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of themiddle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heardabout.  Of course, then we would know once and for all how the country*really* feels about it, and then what could we argue about?>  (other stuff deleted- left for Ralph to answer :) )>>>>>                          Ralph D.
