Mr. D. McCarty
Managing Director and Chief Commercial Officer
Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. McCarty,

I am writing on behalf of the Mackenzie Delta Explorers Group who are a
group of seven E&P companies with current and proposed exploration
activities in the Mackenzie Delta area. The member companies include
Anadarko Canada Corporation, Alberta Energy Company, Anderson
Exploration/Devon, Burlington Resources Canada Energy Ltd, BP Canada Energy
Company, Chevron Canada Resources and Petro-Canada Oil and Gas.

We are assessing alternatives to transport natural gas from the Delta to
southern markets and will soon be engaging in a feasibility engineering
design study to assess routing,  construction techniques, optimum sizing,
pressure requirements, capital and operating costs, liquids handling,
gathering systems, environmental considerations and other relevant design
parameters.

We are contacting potential strategic alliance partners in the pipeline
arena to determine the level of interest of  participating in the study
and/or contributing information to the Feasibility exercise.

If you require more information and wish to discuss this in more detail,
please fell free to contact me (403-296-4824) or Rod Maier (Chevron Canada
Resources 403-234-5433).

Thanks for your consideration.

Ken, 
    I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.  Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?  We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.  Are you going to do anything about it?  I think that a lot of people would like to know.

Dan

John,
     Just one suggestion. I think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file CH.11.  In the first paragraph, final sentence, could we change it to read "These actions were necessary to ensure that our loans would not be called by the banks due to the cross defaults, and to preserve the value in our core energy business".

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Julie,
Deb refers to "bowl tickets".  I assume that she means "playoff tickets", since the bowl tickets won't be allocated until teams are selected for the BCS Bowls (which is after the playoffs in Dallas).

Subject:	Bingaman/Murkowski

A development out of Washington today was Daschle's instruction to
Bingaman to take energy legislation directly to the floor of the Senate
and bypass the mark-up process in the Committee. Although this doubtless

primarily driven by ANWR dynamics, we do not know whether any Alaskan
gas line legislation is to be part of a Bingaman bill or not. It does
underscore the need to make a vigorous representation to the Senators
from our re-enlistment group. I'd appreciate that you can provide a
response to my email from yesterday containing a draft letter from
ANNGTC/Foothills on behalf of the re-enlisting partners. I'll be in my
office throughout the day . So look forward to your help.

Kim and John,
     I agree with Kim's second point.  I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific.  I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself.  Can we clean this language up a little?

Thanks John.  For your convenience in reviewing the language, I have attached a redline copy that shows the changes that John made to our original language.  Regarding his changes:

1.	A big omission in his new section is the covenant  not to construct or cause to be constructed a natural gas pipeline within the right of way.  I thought that was a covenant we wanted.  If that is not the business deal, then the change is fine.
2.	I think a 10 business days is fine.  That being said, you usually don't indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer.  We could submit a binding acceptance but I don't think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that Ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated.  I also don't think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money.  Maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back.  (If you and Danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price, we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well.)  The easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a binding acceptance to their offer.

Let me know your thoughts.  Kim

Here's John's response to the Right-to-Match language.  His client's main interest is in participating in the construction of new assets, which is the purpose of the last sentence.  This seems reasonable to me.  Dan suggested ten days response time, which John is agreeable to.  Please advise if we can work with this.

Kim, I believe I have the schedules, which I will fax to you for scanning.

John- try this on for size...I haven't vetted it on my end yet, but see how
you feel about it:

Section 4.06  Right to Match.
Buyer agrees that within one year of the Date of this Agreement if it
receives a bona fide offer (the "Purchase Offer") to acquire the right to
construct or to place into service natural gas and/or liquid pipelines
within the Company's right-of-way, Buyer will first, by written notice to
Seller, offer to Seller the right to construct or to place into service
natural gas and/or liquid pipelines within the Company's right-of-way on the
same terms and conditions as the Purchase Offer (the "ROFR Offer").  The
written notice provided by Buyer shall state (i) that Buyer has received the
Purchase Offer and intends to accept such Purchase Offer and (ii) the terms
and conditions of the Purchase Offer.  Seller shall have five (5) business
days from receipt of the ROFR Offer to indicate its willingness to match the
Purchase Offer by submitting by wire transfer to Buyer's designated bank
account the Purchase Offer in immediately available funds..  If Seller does
not indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer or does not respond
within five (5) days, then Buyer may consummate the transaction with the
counterparty, provided that the transaction consummated with counterparty is
on the same terms and conditions set forth in the ROFR Offer.  If the
transaction with counterparty is modified in any respect from that set forth
in the ROFR Offer, the modified terms and conditions shall be deemed to
constitute a new Purchase Offer and Seller shall be entitled to a new right
to match the Purchase Offer as set forth above in this Section 4.06.  In the
event that Seller matches the Purchase Offer by submitting funds to Buyers
designated bank account, Seller shall assume all other terms and conditions
of the Purchase Offer, including, but not limited to, any limitations,
restrictions or preferences of the selection of the construction company or
any other contractors normally associated with the construction, operation
and maintenance of gas and liquid pipelines.

Subject:	Organization Changes

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Stan,
       Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.  Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.  We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and Lorraine would sell for incremental revenue.  If this doesn't prove fruitful, then I would intend to pursue the FERC decision.  Agreed?

Tony + Kim,

Several of the rejoining partners of ANNGTC have contacted me asking if Enron is interested in selling its residual claims.  The answer is most definitely affirmative.  Please advise on the following-

What are the bankruptcy court's requirements to undertake a mandated auction?
Is it possible through the bankruptcy court to extinguish liability claims arising prior to NAGC's withdrawal from the ANNGTC partnership?  If so, how?

Here's how I would like to proceed-
Prepare an offering letter that identifies what we are selling and preferred terms + conditions
Distribute to each partner, possibly other interested parties (ANS producers)
Obtain bids and evaluate best offer

I would like to begin the sales process asap and would appreciate your feedback most urgently.

Richard,
       Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.
       Judy and the kids are doing fine.  We do see London alumni on a regular basis.  Are you going to be here over the holidays?  We'd love to see you guys. Let me know what your calendar looks like.

Hey Danny,

Everyone here at ICC is praying for our Enron "alumni" back in Houston, and
I hope you and the family are ok.

I just wanted to check in on you and see how you are weathering this storm;
it's got to be indescribably gut wrenching.
fyi, we are coming back; me in January to work for Stan Babiuk in Major
Projects and the family will return early March.  Everyone is still in
denial, but it is best for me right now.  EP Europe is definitely not where
I need to be in the short term.

Drop me a note back if you get a spare minute.
take care

Danny,
CTN, a subsidiary of the SGA, is  seeking a corporate sponsor for the special security broadcast described  below.  We hope Enron will join other industry leaders as  a sponsor.  We would also welcome someone from you organization  on the program, should you wish.  Sponsors will enable us to make the  program available to companies as a web cast and to include more agency and  government presenters by using studios in D.C. 
Major sponsorships are available for this  broadcast at $15,000 and $25,000.  Host sponsorships are $2500.   Your sponsorship will enable you to receive the program down linked at  your office and be invited to the dinner with participating executives on  October 31.  
Please let me know who else I should  present this opportunity to at Enron.  We plan to send the initial news  release this Friday.  I will have additional content information after the  committee meets later this week.  
I attached the brochure from our Special  broadcast in October so you can see the type of publicity we will be  sending.  Our standard viewer reach is 100,000 employees.   Because of the nature of this broadcast, we expect the numbers to be much  higher.  Vicky Bailey or Joe Kelleher, Asst. Secretary, DOE have agreed to  be on the program, pending no significant changes in world  events.  FERC Commissioner Brownell and Andrew Lundquist from V.P.  Cheney's office have also expressed an  interest.

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron

Pam,
     I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.  Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.  I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.  If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop. 
     When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia?
     Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.

Pam...
You are correct...the mock-up room has been disassembled.  We have one station of the new product set up on our floor, but as you noted, it is in the middle of our work area, and it would be disturbing to have people walking through all day.  What is the objective to walking people through?  Is it just for informative purposes?  If so, we might be able to arrange a group presentation at a later date.
Thanks!

Is this possible right now? I'm not sure if/when you will have the furniture built-out and ready for viewing. Do you still have "the room" set up, or will you have a viewing area available, so people could look without having to go into someone's actual work space?  

As for Julie's proposed schedule for viewing... at the moment, Joan Lipuscek and I have more than we can handle just trying to get all the churn requests done for the next two weeks, so we really cannot commit to manning the room for the hour to show the furniture as suggested below. Do you have any suggestions as to the best way to handle? I defer to your judgement. Thanks for whatever you can do to help!

Danny requested that we set up one day next week for the ETS employees to view the new furniture. A memo would be sent out to all ETS employees inviting them to come by and view the new furniture. 

Please advise the exact location of the room that showcases the furniture and Danny suggested that the assistants being on hand in the room (which I understand is now located on the 4th floor).  Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you, Joan and the assistants each covering one hour.  A hour coverage will not impact anyone's schedule and allow everyone an opportunity to view the furniture.  

I propose Tuesday, September 19th and the following schedule.  The assistants will be notified of the schedule once we confirm the date.

This article demonstrates the difficulty Bingaman will have trying to change current law and roll over the Alaskans.

Article from Today's CQ Monitor



Terrorist Attacks May Tilt Gas
Pipeline Route Toward Alaska

The debate over federal support for
a pipeline to transport natural gas
from the North Slope oil fields of
Alaska to the lower 48 is expected to
accelerate during the next few weeks
because of the terrorist attacks.
Alaska lawmakers, who already
were pushing for federal dollars to
subsidize a pipeline that stays within
their state for much of its route, now
are citing the threat to world energy
supplies as a new justification. Until
now, arguments over a route have
turned on economics, with the oil
companies that own the gas supply
arguing that the route sought by
Alaskans is simply not supportable.
They want no congressional dictates
on routing.
Even before the Sept. 11 attacks,
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., described the development of
the natural gas pipeline as both an
"economic and national security
issue."
Now, ranking Republican Frank H.
Murkowski, R-Alaska, says the attacks
will bolster congressional support for
the project. "These attacks are evi-dence
to the American public that as
we increase our dependence on for-eign
sources, we abrogate our national
security responsibilities."
One possible route, commonly
referred to as the northern route,
would stretch 1,619 miles from
Prudhoe Bay under the Beaufort Sea,
come ashore in northern Canada and
extend up Mackenzie River valley to
Edmonton. The other route, com-monly
referred to as the southern or
highway route, would extend 1,982
miles from Prudhoe Bay south to
Fairbanks, Alaska, and then toward
Edmonton. This route would parallel
the Alaska Highway.
Northern route supporters, which
include the Canadian government, say
that it is the only economically viable
route. Alaska's Democratic governor
and all-Republican congressional dele-gation
support the southern route.
They say the pipeline's construction
would create jobs for Alaskan workers
and allow Alaskan communities to tap
into the gas supply.
Last week, Joe Handley, resources
minister for Canada's Northwest
Territories, told a business conference
in Yellowknife that Tuesday's attack
may have harmed prospects for the
northern route. "They may decide that
even though the Alaskan pipeline isn't
economically viable, they may decide
to go ahead with it anyway just to
maximize their self-sufficiency,"
Handley said, according to a Canadian
Broadcasting Company report.
Although Bingaman has vowed to
include language in his comprehen-sive
energy bill (S 597) that would
"streamline the regulatory approval
process" for construction of a natural
gas pipeline from Alaska, "he has
always been route-neutral,"
spokesman Bill Wicker said.
However, the chairman is a realist.
"If people put in provisions specifying
a route, so be it," Wicker said.

Eric,
      FYI, I had my Assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--John never called once.  I called him yesterday and left him a lengthy message and received no return call.  I called again today and received no return call.  You may have a good relationship with these guys, but I think that John may be a bit flaky and would question his veracity.  I'll try one more time, then I'll call it quits.

Bob,
      I've not kept up with Brian for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that Brian worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  Brian really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by Brian and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that Brian and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). 
      As for enemies at Enron---I think that they are all gone (Ken, Amanda, Cliff, John Stokes and crew).  I think that Mark Frevert still thinks highly of Brian and understands that Brian was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the Ken and Amanda thing).
      I do know that Brian has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very Christian and has a lot less ego than he once had.  If I could hire him back, I would.  I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.  I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me.
      Let me know if I can help further.

Brian called me last week and shared that you had suggested he call.  As you
know, he has some significant holes in his resume' and has a few enemies
within the Enron family.  I never worked with him so I don't know his
genuine abilities.  Could you shed some light on your experience with Mr.

Danny,

To keep you updated, we are reorganising our Merchant Energy function
globally, and John Hushon, CEO of Europe (my direct boss) is leaving end of
the year.  As a result, I have put activated my own return to the US and it
looks like I will be moving to Jay Holm/Stan Babiuk's group as Director of
Project Development in Major Projects.  It could be fun, depending on how
much running room they will let me have.  It will be nice to get back up to
speed on the US side as well.

I'll be back in Houston effective January 1, and the family is moving end of
February.  It should be official by the end of the week, as soon as I get
some HR items nailed down.  Anyway, you know before most El Paso people do,
so please don't mention anything just yet.

Also, I know it's tough times right now.  Just wanted to let you know that
I'm praying for you and my many other Enron friends right now.  Hang in
there man.

I'll be in touch.

Stan,
      As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (Rod's and Corps.) stands at $800m.  Rod has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.  Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.  As for the PSA, Staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being.
      If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.  I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value.
      Let me know your thoughts on this one.

Dan

Kim and John, 
     I agree with Kim's second point.  I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific.  I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself.  Can we clean this language up a little?

Thanks John.  For your convenience in reviewing the language, I have attached a redline copy that shows the changes that John made to our original language.  Regarding his changes:

1.      A big omission in his new section is the covenant  not to construct or cause to be constructed a natural gas pipeline within the right of way.  I thought that was a covenant we wanted.  If that is not the business deal, then the change is fine.

2.      I think a 10 business days is fine.  That being said, you usually don't indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer.  We could submit a binding acceptance but I don't think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that Ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated.  I also don't think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money.  Maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back.  (If you and Danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price, we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well.)  The easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a binding acceptance to their offer.

Let me know your thoughts.  Kim

Here's John's response to the Right-to-Match language.  His client's main interest is in participating in the construction of new assets, which is the purpose of the last sentence.  This seems reasonable to me.  Dan suggested ten days response time, which John is agreeable to.  Please advise if we can work with this.

Kim, I believe I have the schedules, which I will fax to you for scanning.

John- try this on for size...I haven't vetted it on my end yet, but see how 
you feel about it: 

Section 4.06  Right to Match. 
Buyer agrees that within one year of the Date of this Agreement if it 
receives a bona fide offer (the "Purchase Offer") to acquire the right to 
construct or to place into service natural gas and/or liquid pipelines 
within the Company's right-of-way, Buyer will first, by written notice to 
Seller, offer to Seller the right to construct or to place into service 
natural gas and/or liquid pipelines within the Company's right-of-way on the 
same terms and conditions as the Purchase Offer (the "ROFR Offer").  The 
written notice provided by Buyer shall state (i) that Buyer has received the 
Purchase Offer and intends to accept such Purchase Offer and (ii) the terms 
and conditions of the Purchase Offer.  Seller shall have five (5) business 
days from receipt of the ROFR Offer to indicate its willingness to match the 
Purchase Offer by submitting by wire transfer to Buyer's designated bank 
account the Purchase Offer in immediately available funds..  If Seller does 
not indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer or does not respond 
within five (5) days, then Buyer may consummate the transaction with the 
counterparty, provided that the transaction consummated with counterparty is 
on the same terms and conditions set forth in the ROFR Offer.  If the 
transaction with counterparty is modified in any respect from that set forth 
in the ROFR Offer, the modified terms and conditions shall be deemed to 
constitute a new Purchase Offer and Seller shall be entitled to a new right 
to match the Purchase Offer as set forth above in this Section 4.06.  In the 
event that Seller matches the Purchase Offer by submitting funds to Buyers 
designated bank account, Seller shall assume all other terms and conditions 
of the Purchase Offer, including, but not limited to, any limitations, 
restrictions or preferences of the selection of the construction company or 
any other contractors normally associated with the construction, operation 
and maintenance of gas and liquid pipelines.

John,
     I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?

Ballentine tells me now that he is renegotiating some terms of his deal with his client.  Our Stock Sale agreement is acceptable to both parties but won't be signed now until John can work out his other deal.  We are postponing signing the agreement until Monday, November 12.

Any more word from Mr. Babiuk?

Stan,
     The initial numbers from El Paso (as a Seller of their interest) would have equated to a 14 to 15x  EBITDA  with a valuation more in the range of $180m.  While we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price, we expect that they would come in at $80-$90m.  They have yet to respond.  In the mean time, we are sitting on Deb's lowball (by her own admission) offer for two to three more days.

At 7 to 8 times EBITDA I think the valuations should be in the range of $85 to $100 million.  Both EOTT and NBP's have bought assets in this valuation range.

Phil,
       Due to the increasing demands on Stan, I'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field (Hayes, Harris, Neubauer, Miller, Kilmer, and myself).  Stan's already taken, and I'm sure that you have taken, more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism, so we'll help tow the line.  Would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future?  Let me know.

Joel,
      I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.  Try Geoff Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, Rich Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.  I know that Duke is still hiring, too.  The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.  I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.

     Take care.

Dan

Ever really want someone to wake you up from a bad dream...

The good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence. The word is, basically, sell yourselves to someone or liquidate.

Any suggestions on where I should start looking?

Our house hasn't sold in Indy yet, but the job market there is pretty slim. Think we'll go ahead and plan to stay here in Houston.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

Rod,
   I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock.
   I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.

      I thought you had talked to Susan about covering for Julie on Friday afternoons.  She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.  I had phones shifted over to Audrey after I got a call from Cindy looking to find Julie or me.  If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.

Drew,
      The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.  Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.  Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-Enron counterparty.  Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?  If not, we could have a big hole for next year.

     I thought we were moving towards limiting the reference to the Withdrawn Partners solely to the attempt to reconstitute the old Partnership, by a simple modification to Paragraph 1.  I think it's still pretty fuzzy, don't you?  What was wrong with Duke's proposed changes?

     I had approved an offsite Happy Hour for our Market Services Group following our string of emergencies (about a $2500-$3000 expenditure).  Considering everything that has happened, we're reviewing all costs, whether previously approved or not, and cutting where we can.  This is one that I don't think I should pull unless you feel strongly that I should.  Let me know your thoughts.

Mr. D. McCarty
Managing Director and Chief Commercial Officer
Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. McCarty,

I am writing on behalf of the Mackenzie Delta Explorers Group who are a
group of seven E&P companies with current and proposed exploration
activities in the Mackenzie Delta area. The member companies include
Anadarko Canada Corporation, Alberta Energy Company, Anderson
Exploration/Devon, Burlington Resources Canada Energy Ltd, BP Canada Energy
Company, Chevron Canada Resources and Petro-Canada Oil and Gas.

We are assessing alternatives to transport natural gas from the Delta to
southern markets and will soon be engaging in a feasibility engineering
design study to assess routing,  construction techniques, optimum sizing,
pressure requirements, capital and operating costs, liquids handling,
gathering systems, environmental considerations and other relevant design
parameters.

We are contacting potential strategic alliance partners in the pipeline
arena to determine the level of interest of  participating in the study
and/or contributing information to the Feasibility exercise.

If you require more information and wish to discuss this in more detail,
please fell free to contact me (403-296-4824) or Rod Maier (Chevron Canada
Resources 403-234-5433).

Thanks for your consideration.

Steve,
    It looks like you're going to need some help on your bonus numbers based on your team's performance.  I have an extra $24,500 that you can have now.  Use it if you need to.

Eric,
      Bob will be reporting into the Asset Development Group (which is you), but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here.  It is important to TCPL and all of the others to know that Bob does have direct access to Stan and me.  This is consistent with what Bill had originally talked to Bob about.  Okay?

Danny,

It's ok by me if Bob reports to you on ANNGTC - - - I'm ready to step in any time if this reporting structure becomes burdensome and will stay in the info loop at any rate.

This afternoon I called Paul to let him know that I am getting involved with the A to B Alaskan activities on behalf of Enron, not Northern Border.  He was ok with my involvement and will let Tony Palmer and Dennis McConaghy know.  He asked if you were remaining involved and I said yes that I would report to you on this project.  He asked me to let you know that he has a call into you regarding getting the joint development agreement going on the B to C line.  Bob Hill

Dan - We would like to invite you and your wife to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha.  This year, we are having a combined ETS & NBPL party with the social hour starting at 6:30, dinner at 7:30 followed by service awards program.  Bill Cordes is inviting Stan and if it works out that you could get a company plane, we would then ask Rod Hayslett, Shelley, and possibly Phil Lowry depending on seats available.

All of us would love to have you attend.  Let us know at your convenience.

Danny,

I met with Phil Lowry, Jerry Martin, John Keller, and Kevin Hyatt to discuss the revised cost estimates for Sun Devil.  My blood pressure has eased somewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers want to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further squeeze the cost bundle.
  
Here's a quick recap-

$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open season.
$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season.
$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc

The difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM.  

Of this, $218 MM relates to-

-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)
-[$44] MM for 36" pipe vs 30" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to be confirmed by the engineers.
-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)
-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition
-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in original estimate)
-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the original scope)

We can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original project scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won't overbuild with 36" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippers pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on finding other potential savings.

The remaining $109 MM comes under the category of "identified risks".  Estimates are provided in current dollars and the "escalation" component highlights the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little recent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs for Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discussions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - - seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust.

Dave,
   FYI. I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination. Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything. How can we get these answers?

     I understand your concern, but at this point, I may have to tell you who the "right" person is for the time being.  I am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done, why and when.   Whatever is done, I can assure you that your "right" choice to fill any position will be from within our group, and will make sense from an overall ETS Commercial perspective.

Subject:	Storage Business

Danny,

Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business.  The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction.  We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group.  This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group.  Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group.  If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa.

This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people).  We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.

Shelley,
       I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.  I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible.  After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.  Thanks.

Dan

Pam,
     Forget the monitor and video cart, I had Julie order them off iBuyit today.  Who should we call to test the CATV cable that was installed, as it appears not to work, and who do we call to remove the 36" TV and entertainment center that was delivered to us last week?  Thanks.

Stan,
      Last week we coordinated with Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro, Joe Hartsoe and the Washington office, so that they would make sure that our objections (as outlined in Dennis's communication below ) to certain portions of Bingaman's proposed legislation would be heard. They've all been working on the issue this week and will continue through the Bingaman hearings. Williams, El Paso and Duke have all done the same.

Dan

Tom, as you probably are aware Senator Bingaman is holding hearings on the Alaskan pipeline situation next Tuesday in Washington. As Foothills and ANNGTC, 
Mike Stewart and I are going to be appearing before that committee. Other notables will be the producers and state of Alaska. We will be finalizing our prepared 
remarks on Monday and I will undertake to email a copy prior to our appearence. The basic messages will continue to be: 
  
  
          a view that no legislative action is required at this time. In fact, any unsettling of the legislative status quo may actually slow down the overall commercial         process pariticularly if two conflicting statutues were to be put in place.
          genuine commercial activity is progressing, both in terms of dealing with the liabilities issue within ANNGTC and a commerical proposal to the      producers     from a reconstituted partnership
          ANGTS continues to remain a viable and expeditious means of bringing this resource to market within decade, particularly from the broadest      stakeholder   perspective

We have been advised by our Washington counsel that it would be extremely helpful if the Withdrawn Partners ,or "to be" re-enlisted Partners, would provide the 
Chairman will some communication on thier view of the need for any legislative initiative at this time. 
I understand Williams is intending to communciate to the Chairman in this manner. 
I offer you the following attachment drafted by our Washington counsel for your consideration as a basic framework if you see merit for Enron in providing a 
contribution to Senator Bingaman. 
However you wish to proceed, I dutifully provide you with a copy of our prepared remarks prior to our appearence.

Eric,
     Considering the number of fires we have at Enron right now this is about the last thing on Stan's mind.  Hill and Hartsoe are appropriate to be attending this meeting.  Again--I think that this is a bit more of Dennis' overkill.  Do you think he goes dove hunting with grenades?

Gentleman, 

The two attached email items from Van Ness describe draft legislation which Senator Murkowski is considering introducing and the likely timing of such action. 

As the note describes, Murkowski would: 

ban OTT; and 
introduce a "trigger date concept", presently Jan. 1, 2003, for ANGTS would have filed with the Secretary of Energy a proposal which the Secretary certifies to be the substantial equivalent of a complete Section 7 application for public convenience and necessity; in the event the trigger date is not met, allow the "producer enabling" legislation, which would provide ANGTA-type expedition for any NGA Section 7 application to build a pipeline in Alaska, to come into effect. 

Currently, our best sense is that Murkowski could unveil this alternative as early as next week, either as part of a Republican energy bill or an amendment to pending legislation. 

Concurrently, the Democratic side , via the staffs of both Daschle and Bingaman, are preparing a comprehensive energy bill which will contain an Alaskan gas pipeline title.  At present, we do not yet have a sense of what that title would contain, and we been assured the current "placeholder" in the draft does not indicate that Daschle and Bingaman have 
decided to support producer legislation. 

While it is not certain that Murkowski could force this issue alone, it is in our collective best interests to forestall any producer legislation by demonstrating real progress as soon as possible. This is particularly true because the current political situation could make it easier for Murkowski or others to bypass the usual process and proceed with an amendment to non-energy legislation from the floor. 

Based on the advice from our advisors in Washington, we believe that we should execute and publicly announce the MOU no later than November 15, and earlier if feasible.  We also believe  that the signatories to MOU should be available in Washington on the 15th to meet face to face with Murkowski, Binagman and Daschle to convey: 

progress on the re-enlistment as represented by the MOU; 
our commitment to the development of a commercial proposal for ANGTS that results in serious face-to-face negotiations in the first quarter of 2002; and 
our continued position that any legislative action by Congress at this time is premature because 

we have resolved, in principle, a key obstacle identified by the producers; 
with all parties coalescing around an Alaskan Highway project, ANGTS remains the best vehicle for expediting the actual construction of the pipeline; 
because we need the Producers as shippers, there is no possibility that we could exert undue commercial pressure on them; and 
establishing a deadline would provide the producers with the incentive to simply run out the clock. 

Although circumstances politically might suggest our being in Washington ahead of the 15th, I recognize that the 15th better conforms to the reality of commercial progress.  I plan to speak to this on the Wednesday commercial meeting in Calgary. I would hope that at the Wednesday meeting your representatives would be able to confirm your participation for meetings on the 15th with the three Senators. 

Obviously, it is our view, at Foothills/ANNGTC, that we want to deflect the Congress from enacting any legislation at this time, and particularly anti-ANGTS legislation like that Murkowski is considering.  We need the help of Murkowksi and others to cause the Producers to match the serious steps and compromises we have made, not to enact a statutory scheme that encourages and rewards their unwillingness to develop a comprehensive pipeline package.

- Fuel prices stay below Plan numbers and we can not hedge at a price even close to what is in the Plan as a base amount much less meet stretch.

-Basis spreads between East and West stay depressed causing the Mavrix and remaining Red Rock space to be valued at margins of $.00 to $.05 going West (also, the demand stays low out West because of weather).

-We can not renegotiate the ROFR contracts prior to expiration and we end up getting the capacity handed back to us in a depressed market.

To get things moving, I could take the development agreement that El Paso and Northern Border negotiated 3 years ago on the Illinois-Wisconsin Pipeline Project and make a few wording adjustments and then offer it to each of you as a first draft of the B-C project development agreement.

Julie,
      All I really wanted to ensure is that we were striving to get as many tickets as we could, since the employees would take as many as we could get.  I was concerned that with all of the cost cutting, someone would just assume that we could get by without the tickets.  I thought that Deb could get eight (8), I'd buy them personally, and I'd use four (Hayes and me), and would give the other four to employees.  If Mary Kay wants four (4), that's fine.  Let Deb know, however, that employees using them for personal use (which I'm sure will be all of them), will be expected to pay for them themselves.

Stan,
       In response to your questions today:

            1. Research Group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks, we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on NNG payroll (Sean Bolks being the lead).  As long as we keep these two, we could get by without them all together.

            2. Government Affairs--we only use one individual out of the Corporate Staff (Pat Shortridge).  Other than that, they provide no value.
      
            3. Aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial (coach) flights.

            4. Strategic Sourcing--TAP does provide a cost effective service.  We could do without it, but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves.

Julie, here is an email invitation, and I'll bring the hard copy tomorrow.  I have registered Danny on the website, so you'll get a confirmation (or he will) by email.  Here's the basic program:  There are only four private nominations from Houston on the torch relay.  The four companies asked to submit a nomination were Enron, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and a technology group from Rice University.  These four companies have one torchbearer each (me from Enron) who will be briefly honored at the reception.  Then the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Utah will thank Danny for Enron's nomination of a torchbearer (me), and three other companies will receive the same honor, and that's it, so it shouldn't be very time consuming for him.  They said the presentations would begin at 7:15 pm.

If he would care to participate in the torchbearing event itself, I will be running the torch from Washington @ Roy Street to Durham @ Rose, on Monday, December 10, at 2:30 PM.

Thanks for your help with this  (The RSVP link below gives you about the same info that you see here.)

In preparation for your Wednesday meeting with Heath, here are some supporting documents.  Will be calling on Tuesday to answer any questions.

1. This is the main argument and rebuttal document  
2. This is the document Heath presented to his investment advisory board, incl. Lay and Whalley  
3. This is a presentation describing the current skills of the team and ensuing organizational structure of the deal  
4. Some backup numbers on valuation this is IdleAire's   and Xtransco's  note they are based on different business models.
5. Some backup documentation on fuel idling burn  (we are conducting tests with Grady Olson that are yielding the same results) and results from a prelim survey we conducted on truck drivers regarding their views and interest in value prop  (note these results are very rough--you should receive a better version before your meeting no Wednesday.)

I will be in Lake Tahoe starting Wednesday morning, but am reachable 24/7 on my mobile 713-269-1777.

Kent,
     I understand your concern, but at this point, I may have to tell you who the "right" person is for the time being.  I am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done, why and when.   Whatever is done, I can assure you that your "right" choice to fill any position will be from within our group, and will make sense from an overall ETS Commercial perspective.

Danny,

Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business.  The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction.  We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group.  This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group.  Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group.  If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa.

This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people).  We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.

Subject: Overview of Investor Conference Call


Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Stan,
     The teleconference today (with TCPL) held nothing really new.  We did agree not to bring in any other third parties, such as El Paso, at this time.  TCPL noted that they would be interested in a roles as the developer (and perhaps as the operator or some or all of the new line), and would also expect to be responsible for all Canadian legal and regulatory matters.  They acknowledged that we have more expertise in the areas of US rates and regulatory and legal, finance, commercial and marketing activities and would expect that we take the lead there.  We are working toward a first cut on a JV structure over the next two weeks.

Attached is a NON BINDING letter of interest to Questar for their Southern Trail Pipeline - west leg.  This is their crude pipeline that was purchased with the intention of converting it to a natural gas line but apparently, their interests have changed.  The west leg runs from near the California border to Long Beach.

The importance of this non binding bid is to get us into the data room so that we can really take a close look and gather information to see how interested we really are in this pipe.

Please let me know if you have any comments.  This letter has gone through legal and will be faxed to Questar today.

Cindy,
    Check and see if PROFITX software is on Stan's computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).  If so, find out if he uses it and let Julie know.  Julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $135.00/mo., and it is not a critical tool for us.  Thanks.

    If you need to reach me the afternoon, you can get me from 3:30 on at 713-345-3271.

But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.  Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage.

I agree it uses an interactive tool, ie  hottap, but I feel what FERC wants is interactive bidding on the posted capacity, so that all have a chance to see others bids and anti up their bid-  EOL doesn't allow that-  MK

Steve, do you see a problem with using EOL as the IOS process for the operational capacity deals?  I don't propose that we get into this level of detail with Staff at this time, but if they like the overall proposal, at some point we'll need to let them know that what we mean by IOS is the EOL process.  (I don't see why we'd have to design a new IOS from scratch if EOL works fine)  Is anyone nervous that the idea of using EOL as part of our capacity posting and sales process will make it harder to sell a settlement to the Indicated Shippers?

I am OK with this but with one note. The interactive open season (IOS) mentioned in 1.b. will most likely utilize Enron Online going forward. The current IOS process is no longer available because of system changes. Therefore, any new IOS system will cost us some investment($?).

I would like to recommend a Personal Achievement Award for Audrey Robertson in the amount of $1000. Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   

If you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval. Thanks.

Danny,

Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis.  He was not happy about the last one, in particular.

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away.
We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate.
We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk.
If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution.
Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen. Murkowski.  We will make our own.

Guys,
      Fran Fagan will be sending you a worksheet for year end bonuses for 2001 and a worksheet for 2002 merit increases.  Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.  Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to Fran Fagan by December 28.  As guidelines:

       1. We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels.
       2.  Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, Stan, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good.
       3.  I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.

Energy Insight News for Thursday, September 20, 2001:


Expectations fall for Canada's natural gas 'frontier'

Canada's arctic north may not be North America's next big natural
gas-producing basin after all.=20

In what one geologist said was a "major, major" reduction in estimated
natural gas potential, the Canadian Gas Potential Committee-a volunteer
group of 50 geologists and other professionals who assess Canada's
undiscovered gas potential-last week reported that Canada's frontier basins=
,
which include the arctic and Mackenzie Delta regions, may hold no more than
60 to 65 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas that ultimately could make it to
market.=20

The new estimate falls short of previous estimates that 300 to 400 tcf of
gas could be found in the Beaufort Basin, the arctic islands and Mackenzie
corridor. It was those estimates that helped encourage geologists, producer=
s
and a number of U.S.-based power plant developers to consider the north as
almost a second Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Gas from that
historically prolific yet now declining basin makes up around 15% of U.S.
imports.=20

"We thought the gas was greener," said Rob Woronuk, a senior analyst with
the Canadian Gas Potential Committee.=20

Still more potentially bad news came from the committee's report.=20

In what Woronuk said was an "embarrassment," the committee has now decided
that Canadian coalbed methane may have less of a role to play than was
previously thought.=20

The committee reversed the findings of its 1997 report that estimated
coalbed methane could account for up to 270 tcf of Canada's overall 570 tcf
natural gas resource.=20

Greg,
     I talked with Kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding, and he is fine with it being handled out of Omaha.  He would like assurances that he and Teb are in the loop during the review process.  This is not the deal that I had with Mary Kay, so I will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through.  Please circle back with Rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks, and I will talk with Mary Kay.
     Also, I do want to be able, at any point, to severe all TW and NNG functions IFF I'm required to--meaning Kilmer has to be in the loop on all TW matters.

Stan,
    I just glanced at your new org. chart and thought I'd make a comment (or really more of an observation).  Jesus had 12 direct reports and screwed up on one of them, so while I agree that a flat organisation is best, I think that you'd better be very careful or you get a godlike ego.

Stan,
     Eric Thode's comment reported by Dow Jones yesterday that "most of Enron's critical employees are under contract" is not sitting well with my people--particularly Mary Kay, Rob and Steve.  He also made a comment that bonuses were "scheduled to be paid in mid-February" (a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made).  I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.  I want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to Dynegy.  And mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness. Could you raise the concern at you 11:00 meeting if possible?

Subject: DealBench in 2002


As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

John,
      I want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it.  All I want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week.  Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate, Forecast or both, I don't care.  Just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow.

I talked with Rod and Bob Hayes and they say the discussion with Stan at his meetings tends to compare the current month to that month in the last Current Estimate because (which I didn't know) the Current Estimate is the last number that Corporate has seen.  The QTRly Forecasts are not published upstairs.

In an effort to produce a document on the Web that all the VPs could use, would you consider publishing the Weekly Net Commercial Contribution Summary that compares to Current Estimate instead of the QTRly Forecast or try to squeeze a comparison to Current Estimate also?

Whaddya think?

Danny, in the past the pipes have chosen different comparisons when they have issued their individual margin comparisons each Friday onto the Website.   Some have chosen to compare the current month to the current month in the 3rd Current Estimate OR to the current month in the last QTR Forecast.  

Now that we are providing you a Summary page we need to be consistent on that Summary at least.  I would recommend that we compare the current month to the current month in the last QTR Forecast since that is the last published Forecast you and Stan have seen.  Any objections?

Eric,
    Julie has asked to take vacation on Friday, so we'll need Susan to cover phones, faxes, and general office business on Friday until 6:00 Eastern/ 5:00 Central.  Based on our efforts in Washington this week, Friday could be a very busy day.

Rod,
      This would be preferable, but I don't understand what rules could be =
changed to alter the existing accounting treatment.  Also, Kent's numbers d=
o not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet =
that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after th=
e project was initially developed.  The other thing to keep in mind is that=
 there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.  =
We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term =
market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage =
to capture short term market anomalies).  Are you okay with that?  I am.

Maybe there is a way to skin this cat.     The service fee can have any num=

I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do=
 we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off=
?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that=
 we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think abo=
ut it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and v=
alued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been =
done.        =20

I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goa=
l line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that =
we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a num=
ber of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?

Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to l=
ook for a better deal?=09

Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can=
't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense ov=

Rod,

Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.

Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected=
 wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei=
r original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and a=
re expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to mod=
el and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would=
 be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing =
the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out t=
he project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to=
 treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob =
Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent ha=
s indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.=20

As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into =
a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells =
and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f=
ield.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu=
lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s=
pend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 y=
ears of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield=
 well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has c=
ommitted $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to thi=
s project for a total of $1.5MM.

Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that =
they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Hallibu=
rton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the re=
ason for high return requirement. =20

The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a=
n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third=
 party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, prelimi=
nary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b=
etween $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for =
the out years. =20

Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming u=
p with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   =
An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up =
with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have revi=
ewed the proposal?

Rod,

We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term=
 project that has negative short term cash flow.

We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen=
ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi=
ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This proj=
ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=
tandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =
identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=
d.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=
onomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=
%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=
 expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=
ears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=
ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =
negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=
terested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.

What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=
s in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=
nron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a gre=
at project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative e=
arnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this=
 financial hurdle??????

Brian,
     If that is the case, I think that I have $0 left.  There was a request earlier this week for  $750 from NNG.  I guess we'll have to put this on hold for now.  I'll get back with Steve Harris.

	You started off 2001 with a $9,000 PAA pool.  To date, there have been nine awards totalling $8,250.  Thus, you have $750 remaining.

	I would suggest that in Audrey's case, we award either $500, but no more than $750, which is in-line with most of the other awards.

	For the rest of the year, you should know that there may be additional funds available if the other divisions are not close to exceeding their allotments.  

	After your decision, I'll have Fran oversee the processing.

I would like to recommend a Personal Achievement Award for Audrey Robertson in the amount of $1000. Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   

If you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval. Thanks.

Pam,
     I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.  Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.  I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.  If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop. 
     When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia?
     Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.

You are correct...the mock-up room has been disassembled.

What is the objective to walking people through?  Is it just for informative purposes?  If so, we might be able to arrange a group presentation at a later date.

Is this possible right now? I'm not sure if/when you will have the furniture built-out and ready for viewing. Do you still have "the room" set up, or will you have a viewing area available, so people could look without having to go into someone's actual work space?  

As for Julie's proposed schedule for viewing... at the moment, Joan Lipuscek and I have more than we can handle just trying to get all the churn requests done for the next two weeks, so we really cannot commit to manning the room for the hour to show the furniture as suggested below. Do you have any suggestions as to the best way to handle? I defer to your judgement. Thanks for whatever you can do to help!

Danny requested that we set up one day next week for the ETS employees to view the new furniture. A memo would be sent out to all ETS employees inviting them to come by and view the new furniture. 

Please advise the exact location of the room that showcases the furniture and Danny suggested that the assistants being on hand in the room (which I understand is now located on the 4th floor).  Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you, Joan and the assistants each covering one hour.  A hour coverage will not impact anyone's schedule and allow everyone an opportunity to view the furniture.  

I propose Tuesday, September 19th and the following schedule.  The assistants will be notified of the schedule once we confirm the date.

Rod,
    I just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ENA contracts asap.  I'll let you know when I have them.

No, and I'd like to know who in my group is using it for 135.31/mo.  Can they tell me that?

Hi Julie.  I'm checking with all of the people who are current users on the Prophet X software (FIMI) to see if they still want to keep their access.  Danny was added as a user several months ago.

I will be removing a few users who have left the company, and I just thought I would check with you and see if Danny was still interested in maintaining his access to the Prophet X software.  FYI, the monthly charge to his RC is $135.31.

Please let me know what he would like to do as soon as possible, and I will take the appropriate action to either maintain his connection to the server or have it deleted if that's what he wants to do.

Thanks for your help!

that it is correct and would you supply any information that is missing.

Also, would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for
eg. , MOU, Technical, Regulatory, Commercial or Legal.  I will update the

Mary Kay,
      At what point can we expect the CPUC and IS's to take their lumps and get on with picking at some other issues?  Hasn't Kern River done something that they can spend their time fighting about?  How do you think this one will go from here?

For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.

      We've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months (weather, terrorist attacks, internet outages, etc.), all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group.  With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.  So, if you have the opportunity, put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler, take a gas controller to lunch, buy a customer rep. a drink (or two) , do what you can to recognize their efforts. Thanks

Mark, 
     I hate losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.  So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.  Thanks.
 
Dan

I tried to call you today to let you see the announcement I am running on a number of org changes including Steve Hotte. Unfortunately you were both in the air and I am away next week, so I've run it anyway. I'm pretty sure we have all the bases covered and  you guys wont have any problem with it.

Cindy,
     For what it's worth, I am quite opposed to going forward with the Enron Christmas Party as planned.  With as much negative press as we've gotten, we are assured that the local TV stations and the Chronicle will cover it, and will put the "lavish" affair in the worst light possible.  Can't we stop it now??
