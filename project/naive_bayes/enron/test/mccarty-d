Subject	RE Agreement NEW LANGUAGE Thanks John  For your convenience in reviewing the language I have attached a redline copy that shows the changes that John made to our original language  Regarding his changes 1	A big omission in his new section is the covenant  not to construct or cause to be constructed a natural gas pipeline within the right of way  I thought that was a covenant we wanted  If that is not the business deal then the change is fine 2	I think a 10 business days is fine  That being said you usually dont indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer  We could submit a binding acceptance but I dont think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that Ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated  I also dont think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money  Maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back  If you and Danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well  The easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a

right-of-way Buyer will first by written notice to Seller offer to Seller the right to construct or to place into service natural gas andor liquid pipelines within the Companys right-of-way on the

and ii the terms and conditions of the Purchase Offer  Seller shall have five 5 business days from receipt of the ROFR Offer to indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer by submitting by wire transfer to Buyers designated bank account the Purchase Offer in immediately available funds  If Seller does not indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer or does not respond within five 5 days then Buyer may consummate the transaction with the counterparty provided that the transaction consummated with counterparty is on the same terms and conditions set forth in the ROFR Offer  If the transaction with counterparty is modified in any respect from that set forth in the ROFR Offer the modified terms and conditions shall be deemed to constitute a new Purchase Offer and Seller shall be entitled to a new right to match the Purchase Offer as set forth above in this Section 406  In the event that Seller matches the Purchase Offer by submitting funds to Buyers designated bank

language I have attached a redline copy that shows the changes that John made to our original language  Regarding his changes 1      A big omission in his new section is the covenant  not to construct or cause to be constructed a natural gas pipeline within the right of way  I thought that was a covenant we wanted  If that is not the business deal then the change is fine 2      I think a 10 business days is fine  That being said you usually dont indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer  We could submit a binding acceptance but I dont think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that Ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated  I also dont think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money  Maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back  If you and Danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well  The easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a binding acceptance to their offer Let me know your thoughts  Kim  File

Washington Gentleman The two attached email items from Van Ness describe draft legislation which Senator Murkowski is considering introducing and the likely timing of such action As the note describes Murkowski would ban OTT and introduce a trigger date concept presently Jan 1 2003 for ANGTS would have filed with the Secretary of Energy a proposal which the Secretary certifies to be the substantial equivalent of a complete Section 7 application for public convenience and necessity in the event the trigger date is not met allow the producer enabling legislation which would provide ANGTA-type expedition for any NGA Section 7 application to build a pipeline in Alaska to come into effect Currently our best sense is that Murkowski could unveil this alternative as early as next week either as part of a Republican energy bill or an amendment to pending legislation Concurrently the Democratic side  via the staffs of both Daschle and Bingaman are preparing a comprehensive energy bill which will contain an Alaskan gas pipeline title  At present we do not yet have a sense of what that title would contain and we been assured the current placeholder in the draft does not indicate that Daschle and Bingaman have decided to support producer legislation While it is not certain that Murkowski could force this issue alone it is in our collective best interests to forestall any producer legislation by demonstrating real progress as soon as possible This is particularly true because the current political situation could make it easier for Murkowski or others to bypass the usual process and proceed with an amendment to non-energy legislation from the floor Based on the advice from our advisors in Washington we believe that we should execute and publicly announce the MOU no later than November 15 and earlier if feasible  We also believe  that the signatories to MOU should be available in Washington on the 15th to meet face to face with Murkowski Binagman and Daschle to convey progress on the re-enlistment as represented by the MOU our commitment to the development of a commercial proposal for ANGTS that results in serious face-to-face negotiations in the first quarter of 2002 and our continued position that any legislative action by Congress at this time is premature because we have resolved in principle a key obstacle identified by the producers with all parties coalescing around an Alaskan Highway project ANGTS remains the best vehicle for expediting the actual construction of the pipeline because we need the Producers as shippers there is no possibility that we could exert undue commercial pressure on them and establishing a deadline would provide the producers with the incentive to simply run out the clock Although circumstances politically might suggest our being in Washington ahead of the 15th I recognize that the 15th better conforms to the reality of commercial progress  I plan to speak to this on the Wednesday commercial meeting in Calgary I would hope that at the Wednesday meeting your representatives would be able to confirm your participation for meetings on the 15th with the three Senators Obviously it is our view at FoothillsANNGTC that we want to deflect the Congress from enacting any legislation at this time and particularly anti-ANGTS legislation like that Murkowski is considering  We need the help of Murkowksi and others to cause the Producers to match the serious steps and compromises we have made not to enact a statutory scheme that encourages and rewards their unwillingness to develop a comprehensive pipeline package Dennis McConaghy  403-920-2011

DL-GA-allenronworldwide1 Subject Overview of Investor Conference Call Today Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview  of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot  of significant events that led to our current situation -- In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments -- Because of these bad investments weve become over-leveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging -- Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under stand financial and operating disclosures and -- On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our 8-K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses non-core businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include -- Natural gas pipeline businesses -- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe -- Retail businesses in North America and Europe and -- Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple  of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity  concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships Non-Core Businesses Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than 8 billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect  that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately 29 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit Rating10-Q Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that  our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows -- Moodys at Baa3       Under Review for Further Downgrade -- Fitch at BBB-             Evolving Status -- SP at BBB-              CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our 1 0-Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov  19 We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference  call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next  few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings 20 20 In

Cc09Centilli James Subject09RE Redfield Deliverability Project Rod Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei r original levels  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and a re expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years  The cost to mod el and rework these wells is estimated to be 573MM  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing  the program at a cost of 768000  If the test program did not prove out t he project would be terminated at this point  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred Bob  Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment  This would result as Kent ha s indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years20 As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into  a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells  and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f ield  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s pend an additional 496MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 y ears of the contract  NNG currently budgets 300000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability Operations has c ommitted 300000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to thi s project for a total of 15MM Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer but has indicated that  they would require a 25 to 30 return for assuming the financing  Hallibu rton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the re ason for high return requirement 20 The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate  Even at an estimated 30 return prelimi nary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b etween 400000 to 500000 the first 5 years and  25000 to 275000 for  the out years 20 -----Original Message-----From 09Hayslett Rod 20 Sent09Friday October 12 2001 705 AM To09Gilbert

Rod We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation  This proj ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s tandpoint  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of  identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte d  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec onomics and have shown that the project has a great return in excess of 30   Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all OM expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y ears of the project  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we dont have this  negative IBIT flow in the first years however Halliburton has not been in terested and has proposed a 30 finance charge for this structure What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost s in 01 to avoid the negative 02 and 03 earnings impact or is there an E nron company that would financeextend the expense payments  This is a gre at project that we should do however it is difficult given the negative e arnings impacts in the first couple of years  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle
