the high pressure shutdowns be reset as close to MAOP as possible without shutting anything down AT MAOP  It may take a little adjustment to find out where that point is for each station  Any problem Jeff -----Original Message-----From 	Vaughan Pat Sent	Tuesday March 05 2002 817 AM To	Whippo Jeff Subject	RE protecting MAOP Jeff The regulations are pretty clear  192619a says     no person may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure which exceeds the lowest of the following     and goes on to talk about design pressure test pressure and highest operating pressure issues  There is no leeway  The regulations provide for the built in problem of buildup pressure in relief devices by giving us up to ten percent above MAOP to achieve full relief capacity IF we need it due to failure of a pressure control device or system  Operator error or roll back due to system demand changes are not acceptable justification for exceeding MAOP From the communications below it looks like the high pressure shutdowns are being used more as a pressure control device than an overpressure protection device  If this is to be the case then the shutdowns must be set at the MAOP not at some percentage above MAOP  If this is done then the relief valves must be sized adequately to prevent operating pressure to exceed the MAOP plus the allowable 10 percent buildup  I believe that some compressors are relying on shutdown switches as primary OPP since existing relief valves are inadequately sized  I dont know if this is the case here My thoughts are that if the operating pressure of a pipeline exceeds the MAOP by any amount then the control systems should be recalibrated to prevent a reoccurrence  If the control system has unacceptable dead band then the economics should justify replacing it  The economics cannot under any circumstances justify operating at any pressure that exceeds MAOP Pat -----Original Message-----From 	Whippo Jeff Sent	Monday March 04 2002 619 PM

times since I have been here  According to the Advisors our shutdowns for high discharge at the mainline stations are set at 1020  This is 12 PSI over MAOP  These shutdowns should prevent the pressure from ever getting high enough to actually blow a relief valve at 10 over MAOP Although we are allowed to set overpressure protection devices to prevent overpressuring by more than 10  I dont believe that this gives us permission to operate above MAOP  My opinion is that we should set the high discharge shutdowns closer to MAOP so that rollbacks due to reduced demand other conditions resulting in high line pack or manipulation of pressure to excavate a line dont result in us exceeding MAOP I need to run this by Pat Vaughn Gas Control and probably a few others but I thought I would start by

grains at Atoka 2 into the West Texas lateral  The instruments that NGPL uses at the Indian Basin plant may not see Butyl Sulfurs  If this it the case we may have the same problem that we have at Atoka 2  If we dont have enough other inputs to blend the gas this can become a quality problem for deliveries at other locations Since this is a 50mmcfd input to our system I sure think we need the

Control can accept control valve operation by NGPL which is included in the current drawings  The installation of 2 control would give us problems with them fighting each other  We have an OBA with NGPL and we will monitor their future compliance to volume requirements   We might have to address in this in the future if the fail to comply but for now were okay NGPL has basically the same tariff as TW and they feel protected from total sulfur at the tailgate of the Indian Basin Plant  The Delmar H2S at the NGPLTW point  will protect us both from H2S  We may want to grab a sample from the IB plant to baseline the current sulfur content and verify accuracy  Darrell and myself are comfortable with the current plans to not install total sulfur at our interconnect with NGPl  The cost of this new instrument is around 40000 and I dont believe either company has plans to replace  NGPL total sulfur instrument Arnie and Terry please review and let us know if Operations can comply with our

date  Chanley Earl  David the IC has not been approved to date a PA has been submitted and is being routed for approvals   We gave a heads up to Jerry and Darryl that a potential interruption to flow could occur in the near future as a result of tie-ins for this IC  Jerry and Darryl then requested that the tie-ins be made during our LaPlata outage which is a three day outage during April 2nd 3rd  4th   Chanley Earl   Talked with Darrel and the Hot tap date will coordinate with other outage of April 2 2002 Line pressure has to be lowered to 702 for welding  I asked that Jerry and Darryl discuss the time frame of tie-ins for Questar with you as I could not say one way or the other if you could mobilize by then  Chanley Earl   trying to get material ASAP for tap Working on details of who buys material for the IC Will know more next week JerryDarryl I did however discuss with the Team to determine if the tie-ins occured during the same time frame as the La Plata outage what would be the impact to manpower and scheduling of tasks at La Plata  The Team committed to the tie-ins during the same time frame but will be asking for 4 days of down time at La Plata now versus the 3 days origianlly requested  They will look at options such as contract labor support team etc to see if they can squeeze this back to three days but it will be a few weeks before that information is communicated   Chanley Earl  David EC will have the contract crews Inspector and others in place to lessen the impact to their schedule   Chanley Earl  The team choice to extend the outage should not be based on the tap as EC will supply any support needed if the team has concerns contact me and we will work them out Chris Gaston will be the team point of contact for the Questar tie-ins  Blackie Foutz will be the Team point person for measurment related issues related to designinstallation Earl can you provide the team with the work order number so that payroll can be charged as they become involved   Chanley Earl  As soon as it is approved and funded  Also can you provide the tentative date of commissioning the interconnect so that we can insure George Kniesley is available to participate along with the team   Chanley Earl  IN service is requested for May 1 02 but will know more after meeting with Questar on who will purchase material and build Team charge time to the work order only as support is requested from EC andor is necessary as part of start up and commissioning If I can do anything to help please give me a call ---------------------- Forwarded by David

November 2001 How Enron Blew It How Enron Blew It Less than a year ago the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything mon ey power glitz smarts new ideas and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo st important company in the world Now its stock is down wall street is be arish and the CEO is gone What went wrong by Mimi Swartz magissuesauthorsmimiswartzphp THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTONS DOWNTOWN feels like th e international headquarters of the best and the brightest The lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c ompanies like Shell and Texaco nearby Enron in contrast throbs with mod ernity The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white b rown Asian Middle Eastern European African as well as American-born T hey are young mostly under 35 and dressed in the aggressively casual unif orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis polo shirts and Banana Repu blic button-downs Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin g intently like winners Enron is nothing if not energetic A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva tors while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe ople entering from the garage A sculpture of the corporate symbol an E ti pped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi s a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe inated Multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratula ting Enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between e levator banks declares Enrons simple if grandiose goal From the Worlds  Leading Energy Company to    The Worlds Leading Company For a while that future seemed guaranteed as Enron transformed itself fro m a stodgy troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000  It was a Wall Street darling with a stock price that increased 1700 per cent in that sixteen-year period with revenues that increased from 40 bil lion to 100 billion The very mention of the company in energy circles th roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates a firm that provides ma rket intelligence to the energy business This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling a visionary determine d to transform American business Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b y then-CEO Ken Lay Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old  formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then  selling it to refineries and other customers Instead it evolved into a co mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water If you had a risky drilling venture E nron would fund it for a piece of the action If you wanted your megacorpor ations energy needs analyzed and streamlined Enron could do the job If y ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning  power needs Enron was there to build and build Basically if an idea was  new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative Enron wanted the first cra ck And with each success Enron became ever more certain of its destiny T he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo rld and in February of this year Skilling reaped his reward when he succe eded Lay as chief executive officer Enron says Skilling was a great mar riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me ntality of the financial markets The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en d of the twentieth century Like the high-tech companies it emulated Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and in turn the Americ an economy Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a  culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but t he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh o could see the future versus those who could not The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital With the best and the brightest a company couldnt possibly go wrong Or could it Today Enrons stock trades at around 35 down from a high of  80 in January The press cast Enron as the archvillain of Californias ene rgy crisis last spring and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market A long-troubled power plant pro ject in India threatened the companys global ambitions Telecommunications  in which Enron was heavily invested imploded Wall Street analysts who o nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices Some of the cha nge in Enrons fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer tain times that has afflicted all of American business But the culture tha t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame ENRON JEFF SKILLING SAYS HAD a totally different way of thinking about b usiness-we got it At Enron in fact you either got it or you were gone -it was as simple as black and white It is not coincidental then that th e color scheme of Skillings River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he  once headed Here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahoga ny floors Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand In the entry white orchids cascade from a b lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white mar ble There is only one off-color note After almost twenty years Jeff Skil ling is no longer associated with Enron having resigned abruptly after jus t six months as CEO Once Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch Gene ral Electrics masterful CEO as one of Worth magazines best CEOs in Ame rica anointed in 2001 and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc hained adventure junkets in which a friend told BusinessWeek someone cou ld actually get killed Today he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr istmas morning I had no idea what Id let go of Skilling says of all th e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron20 From a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons Skilling clarifies The demands o f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances Divorc ed he lived in a 2200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash er He almost missed his brothers wedding Learning a foreign language-I  never learned a foreign language he exclaims He never once took his youn gest son to school Im interested in the kids You dont do kids in fifte en-minute scheduling Travel You cant go to Africa for a week and get a nything out of it Skilling includes the study of architecture and design  on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs Im not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEOs job he says finally  Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it s pragmatic edge It would have been easy to stay he says But that wou ld not have been good for me20 Hes a smallish ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight hand some in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assi duously stolid gaze But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r eporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are  bitterly skeptical of his need for family time His shrug stretches the lim its of his shimmering blue button-down and his matching blue eyes look put upon Im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understa nding this PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni neties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfo lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building From nine t o five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the prist ine silver skyscraper to smoke They perched on the chrome banisters or lur ked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad They always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed Whatever people knew about Enron in tho se days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with th at scene Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters  in Houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past What macho engineer would have put up with s uch humiliation But this company was a child of another time that period in the mid-eighti es when chaos enveloped the gas business Federal deregulation of natural g as turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies freque ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a v olatile free-for-all The situation was compounded five years later by fede ral deregulation of the pipeline business So it happened that a gentlemanl y gas pipeline company Houston Natural Gas HNG found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation Oscar Wyatts less than gentlemanly firm HNG wa s then run by Lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and Transc o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy His doc toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V ietnam War Lay who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar dly-to Texas brashness had done well enough Thanks to canny expansions H NGs pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat e of Texas HNG fended off Coastal but to protect the company from other takeover atte mpts Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska  pipeline concern called InterNorth one of the largest pipeline companies i n the country at the time Then a funny thing happened HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like  Coastal What the Nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being call ed the merger back in Houston and before long following some particular ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston the companys center of gr avity started shifting toward Texas and shortly after that Ken Lay was ru nning a new company called Enron Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with Enron at tha t time He never fought change He embraced change Lay had won but what exactly did that mean Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had  exclusive use of its pipelines Without new ideas-for that matter a whole  new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s tarted20 LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES Jeff Skilling ha d spent a lot of time in the Midwest and he was self-made-at fourteen he h ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora I llinois His mother would drop him off there every day after school I l iked being successful when I was working and I was smart he told Busines sWeek earlier this year But unlike many of his Enron colleagues Skilling  wasnt deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five oclock he  was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than w hat he would come to call intellectual capital He loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people He graduated from Southern Meth odist University went into banking-assets and liability management-and too k on Harvard Business School where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi s class Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped-up path to American success He joined Manhattans McKinsey and Company as  a business consultant and that is where Ken Lay found him in 198520 It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless  and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked While everyone else was worr ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he al one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses And so in a world w here credit was nearly impossible to come by Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers Enron would not be  a broker but a banker It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the  risk involved And Enron would make money on transactions much like an inv estment bank would Skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling The n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec utives He had a one-page presentation Almost to a person Skilling says  they thought it was stupid Almost After Skilling left the meeting dej ected he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized Lay listened and th en said Lets go The Gas Bank was not an overnight success For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze ns of colleagues who had assisted him In fact he had come upon one of tho se divides that seem to define his life I believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way Skilling puts it today and  even if he is typically immodest he was right Fairly soon after launching  the company sold 800 million worth of gas in a week True to Skillings  character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new He says the joke around Enron was that if a companys CEO was under fifty We were in  And he was in too In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation a new division created just fo r him In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned 11 million in profit  After that says Skilling we never looked back Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldnt work unless it ha d a trading component Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w ould make the project go But by buying and selling enormous quantities of  gas Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin ate it The company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the b est access to supplies That in turn attracted more customers who wanted  to be part of the play With so many customers in its pocket Enron could b etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p rice of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but wi th startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could  have ever imagined THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m ade He created within Enron a new culture to match its new trading busin ess The idea was to build a knowledge-based business which demanded a s kill set not exactly prized by Enrons employees from the old HNG days Mos t were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most o f them men of course-the kind of people youd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government But now the company needed b older people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make  money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains The peo ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had na rrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people He wanted the s martest people from schools like Harvard Stanford and maybe Rice And be cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he  wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big gest and best investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B oston In addition to being smart Enron people were also supposed to be a ggressive You were right for Enron if you didnt want to wait until you w ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization20 You could see what he was looking for on Super Saturdays at the Houston h eadquarters eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts their problem-solving a bility their passion for hard work and what at Enron was called a sense  of urgency People who scored less than 25 were scratched The shrewdest  candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired These were t he types that automatically turned down the companys first offer knowing  Enron would come back with more The starting salary was around 80000 Ma ybe it wasnt a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus about 20000 was more  than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof ts being renovated close to downtown Enron people didnt live in far-flun g suburbs Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office For the lucky winners Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a nd-talented program New associates learned the latest techniques for struc turing energy deals and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g lobe The hours were long but every possible need was taken care of A com pany concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning th e house planning a vacation Of course a lot of people who worked for Enr on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou ld use the company gym and the companys personal trainers If they were ov erweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join Enrons Wellness Progra m Massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until t en at night They were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time They really thought about th e psychology and what it took to keep these people going Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts  associates directors and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos e titles didnt really matter Money did Instead of competitive salaries a nd decent bonuses Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus es-with no cap If you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says Ken Rice who stayed with Enron for 21 years un til resigning recently as the head of the companys faltering broadband div ision Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed Gas traders  with two or three years of experience could wind up with a 1 million bonus  And the more you produced the closer you got to Jeff Real hot dogs join ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia Land Cruiser racing in Australia or of f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1000 race ending at a sp ectacular Mexican villa Every time hed speak Id believe everything he d say one loyalist says20 And why not By 1995 Enron had become North Americas largest natural-gas m erchant controlling 20 percent of the market But at a company where the b uzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop Skilling and Lay belie ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv ice at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for Enron they bega n barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power compa ny presidents who with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se rvice areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who wer e somewhat more receptive thanks in part to Enrons generous lobbying effo rts But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling In 1997 Ken Lay m ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company By then  the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity The divisio n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from  2 billion to 7 billion Mr Skillings experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the New  York Times noted Everyone would certainly have thought so Enron and Skill ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran sforming another FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within sang the New York Times in 1999 In the staid world of regulated utilitie s and energy companies Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis crowed For tune in 2000 Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl e and Enron in 2000 obliged with second quarter earnings of 289 million  up 30 percent from the previous year That year the company seemed to dis cover a market a minute Under Skilling Enron was trading coal paper ste el and even weather No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client People drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedg e against the usual winter downturn But most exciting to the financial world was Enrons entry into high-tech c ommunications Because of the companys marketing dominance EnronOnline be came another overnight success handling 335 billion in commodity trades o nline in 2000 Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi d price and the asking price Then there was the broadband business To Enr on trading excess capacity in large high-speed fiber-optic networks empt y lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from tradi ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines So Enron created a market for wha t the industry calls bandwidth Soon after it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes Enron looked like a company that couldnt lose Its strat egy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commo dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market BusinessWeek insis ted There was however another reason Enron did so well in such a short time  the companys hard-nosed approach toward its customers The old notion of c ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust omers to keep them But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t o come to it Over time the company stopping referring to its business cli ents as customers and began calling them counterparties Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable Gains were m aximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur e quickly-such as Zilkha Energys new high-tech approach to drilling for oi l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un derwrite the project if it ever would But because Enron invented its mark ets and subsequently dominated them Enron could set the terms of its deals  from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene d at all20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as mark-to-marke t accounting for instance Enron used it on an unprecedented scale The c ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enrons idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt ge t deals And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an nuities over a period of years Enron took most of its profit up-front How ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year If a few analysts thought there mig ht be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting inves tors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in As the mark et fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a projec t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent  going to be high enough Enron is known for leaving people at the altar  says one former employee Winning the highest possible profits for the comp any could even extend to Enrons attitude toward charity When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission a literacy group called on Enron for a c ontribution it was suggested that he start raising money for Enrons compe ting literacy charity Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron he says As Enron became more and more successful the culture Skilling had created  took on a dark side The competition turned inward As one member of the En ron family put it It became a company full of mercenaries The change st arted at the bottom As Enrons domination of the energy market grew most  of the recruiting frills fell away New associates were treated much like t he commodities the company traded Global Changes Enron spies reported ove rhearing orders like I need a smart person-go buy me one or Buy me an in telligent slave quick Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl e sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa rody A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months It was to o disruptive People couldnt get their work done And of course Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension  The Performance Review Committee which had initially been installed by S killing in the Capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking s ystem in the country Employees were rated on a scale of one to five and t hose with fives were usually gone within six months The PRCs nickname qu ickly became rank and yank It was a point of pride that Skillings divi sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year As one Skilling assoc iate put it Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store Skillings approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro ns attitude toward its workers In time it would become many workers att itude toward the company Teamwork never that valuable in a trading cultur e went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus If protocol required an Enr on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World he might help-or he might not depending on whether another potentially m ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed  They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s ight of the future says one former employee Anyone who couldnt close de als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores as were the higher-u ps who had backed them Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase No old tapes became a n Enron clich People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former Enron executive In such a hothouse paranoia flowered New contracts contained highly restr ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company E-mail was monitored A former executive routinely carried two laptops on e for the company and one for himself People may have been rich at Enron  but they werent necessarily happy One recruiter described the culture thi s way They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y ou bleed to death BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the worlds leading energy  company into the worlds leading company he had to make one more change J ust as he had done ten years before Skilling had to purge the company of i ts remaining old order Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea lt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who d ealt with intangible assets Pipelines power plants-they may have been Enr ons pride but Skilling wanted them gone Expensive long-term building pr ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm ous returns on investment capital and Skilling knew it It wasnt the tim e for long-term approaches an Enron executive says of Wall Streets mood It was the technology era To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past Skilling had to take on Rebe cca Mark long considered his rival for the CEOs job Mark was for many ye ars the poster child for the Enron way Young attractive aggressive-her n ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th e requisite Harvard MBA Mark was largely responsible for the success of En ron International the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed  20 billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for 40 percent o f Enrons profits in 1998 For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on e Enron executive estimated 10 million-and adoring press clips including  two appearances on Fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo rate America But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol Indi a one of the largest ever constructed She had played the game the Enron w ay Taking Enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes 20 p ercent instead of the usual 53 and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c hanges in government But the time and expense needed to make India and oth er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enrons goals  and Skillings impatience with Mark grew Forcing Mark out however was no easy matter Key executives left divisio ns were dismantled but she remained The truth was Enron didnt mind firin g lower-level employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relen tless people it tended to promote The company preferred humiliation-keepin g a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title One particularly d ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis A company a s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa ster So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar k her own company Despite Skillings contempt for asset-heavy businesses  Enron spent more than 2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti lity that could serve as Enrons entry into the emerging world of water pri vatization Mark was put in charge of making Enron yes the worlds greate st water company Azurix as the new business was called looked like anoth er sure thing Its IPO in 1999 raised 695 million20 But Mark had to succeed on Enrons increasingly abbreviated timetable in a  business fraught with political and emotional complexities Water is not li ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money The company stumbled layoffs commenced an d confidence evaporated By August 2000 the stock price which had started  out at 19 had fallen to 5 Marks resignation followed and Azurix much diminished was folded into Enron I think its best for Rebecca to start afresh Lay who had been a mentor to Mark told the Wall Street Journal Or as one critic put it They were more interested in destroying the old  culture than running a business20 As 2000 drew to a close Skilling was in total command In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable The best time for the succession to occur is wh en the company is doing well he told the press Enron is doing extremely well now In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEOs job ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED Enrons domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac le Both PBSs Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron portraying t he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington L ay and Enrons political action committee are the top contributors to Georg e W Bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo od or electricity Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent  anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the companys jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif ornia as both tried to buy power online The Times reported that Lay had t ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d eregulation The bad press was to say the least ironic Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence Wall Street was discovering its we aknesses By late March the stock price had slid to 50 a share from 80 in January Within Enron the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline The  India plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of  constant turnover within Enrons management team But the California situa tion was more visible and therefore more damaging despite Enrons claim th at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population  and never properly managed those it had For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us says Mark Palmer a vice president for corpo rate communications We were a Texas company There was a Texan in the Whi te House California was a state that didnt put him in office and his big gest contributor was a Texas energy company Performance is going to take c are of our stock price The truth will take care of Gray Davis Californi a utilities still owe Enron 500 million another reason stockholders might be panicky But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skillings al l too apparent lack of contrition Facing down his critics he cracked a jo ke comparing California with the Titanic At least the Titanic went down  with its lights on But the biggest problem was Enrons telecommunications division which had  been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from 155 billi on in 2001 to 383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst So too d id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster For the first tim e in its confoundingly successful life Enron had nothing new to take to ma rket Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enrons most important cheerleaders t he stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant D uring the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who chal lenged Enrons financial reporting an asshole When the company reported  hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profit s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse ts Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enrons accounting Skilling pr omised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner Th ere wasnt any positive news Carol Coale of Prudential Financial says n ow Basically he talked me out of a downgrade The business press so generous in the past turned surly Fortune had aske d in March whether Enron was overpriced Start with a pretty straightforw ard question How exactly does Enron make its money The routine cashing  in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray ed in the media as a fire sale Skilling had sold 33 million worth Ken L ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount Then the Wall Street Jour nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with in the company It was essentially risk management against Enrons possibl e failures Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th e stock price By late August it had fallen below 40 Enron so institutio nally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine When Wall Stre et is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting  says Carol Coale When a company falls out of favor all these issues ca rry more weight This fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started e xperiencing an attack of conscience Those who had looked the other way as  the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th eir ways It just created an attitude one executive still at Enron says If senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard Th ere was a real culture of Were above everyone else20 Loyalty had never been prized at Enron so there was no reason to expect it now An old-fashioned slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road But as one Houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit h someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporati on thats better suited for good times than bad As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too As the sto ck price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration Then after a trip to visit the families of three employe es killed at a plant in England he had an epiphany Life was short for hi m Enron was over Ever stoic Ken Lay returned to the CEOs office named  a new president arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors  and promised a kinder gentler Enron in the future Trading anything and  everything was out The company Lay says will still innovate but innovat e much closer to our core As for the culture Things like the Performanc e Review Committee I think we could have applied better By trying to cate gorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a mo rale problem That Skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence Despite Skillings lengthy tenure wi th Enron hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always belie ved in cutting losses and moving on But now that he was abandoning them wh en the company was in trouble it was different Even Jeffs biggest detra ctors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back Look he s ays with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron Were my int erests aligned with the shareholders Absolutely Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims elf back into the world of ideas His eyes flash as he talks about new tech nologies The first wave never gets it right he says The stand-alone d ot-coms didnt work but the technological applications will create a secon d wave that will change the world Houston he promises will become the w orlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it In f act he is already shopping for office space This is the second wave and Enrons got it he says almost breathless  There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g et it
