Evaluator EGE Shirley As requested herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski The presentation on the EGE tools applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday May 29 might I request it be set for late afternoon as my other appointments are the next day And as Vince will recall I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly and developer of the Ramp Up Real Time 75check and Electric Strategy tools  Presently I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting ELC Background The US power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively  Utilities who still control most power plants endeavor to adopt the entrants methods  Yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling  Many utilities notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization cling to ingrained routines Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale  A utility may operate a relatively small system fewer than a dozen plants  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers playing the wholesale market at the margin For a variety of reasons utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily or seasonally  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed week after week and run in the half-load range EGE Objectives EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant I An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility or to price wholesale power more aggressively to take market share from the utility ie compel changes in unit commitment habits II An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition III A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utilitys unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized Specific EGE Concepts EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities It produces indicative statistics such as a the frequency distribution of starts per week b the frequency distribution of starts by day15-minute segment during the week c the frequency distribution of load level d the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start e average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range f average ramp rate from the half-load range g the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and h forced-off maintenance outage rate where indicated Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by monthyear in some cases by temperature range  They can be by regional wholesale prices as well  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 through December 31 2000  EGE 1st quarter 2000 through March 31 2001 will be available approximately June 15 2001 EGE also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility as well as other regional generators  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods without an apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units Other EGE supporting data i planned maintenance schedule where indicated j actual maximum generating capacity k actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values l average heat rate in the full-load range and m average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range With respect to a generating units average heat rate in the half-load three-quarter-load and full-load ranges it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes in recent years in these parameters The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE  In the 4th quarter 2000 for instance one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning 52 times and committed for the whole day in all but two cases  Arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine in part at least at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most of the coming week  At another plant two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range some 550 hours and three-quarter-load range another 400 to 600 hours they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels  Again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy Offering of Energy Leader Consulting ELC EGE is a procedure not a software package or data base  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities ELC transfers its knowledge about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process 1 Enron would select one to three target utilities 2 ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities 3 Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool ELC in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future without the assistance of ELC 4  Optionally ELC would provide EGE supporting data quarterly to Enron The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units  Parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will be specified upon request  Custom modifications will be considered Steven A Mitnick

at this point Hi everyone I have run the model and along with the contract briefs I have some questions  ideas I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed one-sided e-mail but with our schedules being so exclusive this will have to do for now Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract However the JC Pennys version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model so some of these comments may be mute points I plan to do that went I get back 1	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and re-run the model for the time remaining  I would expect this is done already 2	The default probabilities seem not to change That is if the input credit rating is E1 then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period For annual accounting that seems OK but in MTM it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities  That is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world 3	Are all defaults created equal to us Look at OC It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies However we are dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not get paid Sure we still have some credit risk but its not like Montgomery Wards where the lights are being turned off for good Energy is so fundamental for a companys success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally 4	A while back someone said to me that may maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that dont By that I mean that perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES then they are more likely to improve that one that doesnt This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesnt consider This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve 5	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team The contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise  If we can combine our customers into exposure group portfolios for lack of a better term where a group has similar risk characteristics beyind the current parameter set that we define then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets 6	A technical point Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments Besides the model assumptions numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes the number of trials numerical roundoff and random number generator randomness statistical properties The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enrons aggregate credit risk 7	There is one last point here For most of the above points the improved analysis could make the credit risk be higher Rick Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap

ECONOMIC TIMES Wednesday June 06 200120 DPC lenders Singapore meet inconclusive 20 THE CRUCIAL talks between the foreign and Indian lenders of US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company at Singapore remained inconclusive on  Tuesday and are slated to continue on Wednesday The meeting has spilled o ver to the second day with DPC to participate in the proceedings on Wednesd ay financial institutions sources said The sources said Enron India mana ging director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor were likely to p articipate in the second day of the meeting They said the meeting which w ent on for over an hour discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board Nothing has been finalised as yet they said when asked whether both the Indian and foreig n lenders were able to arrive at any solution for solving the current statu s quo At the Singapore meet the lenders have come together to try and dif fuse the tension and unite the two warring partners - DPC and MSEB20 The foreign lenders were expected to be updated by their Indian counterpart s about developments like DPCs preliminary termination notice to MSEB whi ch in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the mult inational from May 29 The Indian lenders would press for completion of the 3-billion project as DPC has stopped commercial production and doubts ar e being expressed for commissioning of its 1444-mw phase-II due on Thursd ay The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India executiv e director R S

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE TIMES OF INDIA Wednesday June 06 200120 Lenders split over DPC transfer notice to MSEB   Pradipta Bagchi20 Lenders to the  29-billion Dabhol Power Company are split over whether DP C should be allowed to issue a transfer notice to MSEB Last Friday Enron  sought the lenders permission--for the second time in a month--to issue a  transfer notice to MSEB A transfer notice allows the valuation of all fixe d assets to begin with and is the first step in starting the process of tra nsfer of assets to the MSEB While domestic lenders like IDBI ICICI and SB I--with an exposure of more than Rs 5000 crore to the project--are opposin g the move to issue a transfer notice most foreign lenders including the l ead arrangers to the project are now agreeable to the transfer notice being issued by the DPC On the first day of lenders deliberations in Singapore  vast differences emerged between the domestic and foreign lenders in this regard20 While domestic lenders are worried about the impact of the huge exposure on their balance sheets foreign lenders who typically have smaller exposure  are of the opinion that without any alternative concrete solutions it ma y be worthwhile to pull the plug on the project Without any concrete sol utions and no fixed time-frame foreign lenders are not willing to go to th eir respective credit committees for further disbursals a lender from Si ngapore told The Times of India There is no point throwing more good mon ey after bad is the consensus among foreign lenders said the lender20 Among other issues discussed on the first day of the meetings was whether t he lenders should throw Enron out of the project and take over the operatio ns of DPC However without a proper team of skilled managers in place it  is unlikely that the lenders will risk throwing out the current operators  Fresh disbursals from the lenders are unlikely Among the first casualties  will be an Enron affiliate company which is the EPC contractor for the LNG terminal On June 8 a payment of  13 million is to be made to the LNG co ntractor which will not be disbursed by the lenders Another big payment o f  25 million has to be made to Bechtel the EPC contractor for the power  plant by June 18 as well20 Enron and DPC officials will make a presentation on Wednesday to the banker s following which further deliberations will be held among the lending ba nks ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE INDIAN EXPRESS Wednesday June 06 200120 DPC lenders meet opens on a positive note The first day of the crucial meeting between the Indian and international l enders in Singapore has opened on a positive note with the foreign lenders  showing signs of giving more time to Indian government to resolve the probl em20 Foreign lenders are enthused by the fact that the Centre is ready to give i ncentives to the project so that DPC can reduce its tariff The Centre pac kage include cutting interest rate on the project and asking the Central E lectricity Authority CEA to work out a contingency plan for sale of power to other States from the Dabhol power projectThe international lenders  are ready to give some more time to find out a solution Lenders will take  the maximum hit if the Enron pulls the plug into the project FI sources  said Hence the rethinking among the international lenders The Centres p ackage to be ready in another two months would also lower the customs dut y on imported LNG which would further help the company to lower the tariff Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor  are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting on Wednesday to  present their side of the story Tuesdays meeting which went on for over  an hour discussed the on-going financial and legal disputes between DPC an d its partner Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEBAt the meet the l enders have come together to try and diffuse escalated tension and unite th e two warring partners DPC and MSEB say FI sources20 While loans from international FIs enjoy the Indian government guarantee i t would be Indian FIs which will have to take the maximum hit if the projec t gets derailed On Tuesday the foreign lenders were updated by the Indian counterparts over series of events like DPCs Preliminary Termination Noti ce to MSEB which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing powe r from the multinational from May 29 The Indian team is led by Industrial  Development Bank of India IDBI executive director R S Agarwal who is als o DPC board member along with representatives of State Bank of India and I CICI The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro Citibank NA  Japan Exim bank and OPIC20 Sanjay Jog20 The Central Electricity Authority CEA has launched an exercise to assess the viability of despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states  across the country announced the Union minister of state for power Jayavan tiben on Tuesday Mehta said that the CEA which has been asked to undertak e this exercise recently will take into account the burden to be borne by  various power deficit states during the despatch of power Currently if th e power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid there is c ertain fixed charge imposed on it The CEA will have to carry out this exe rcise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Da bhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase t hat power the minister added Mehta said that the centre will not purchas e Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take the additional burden on the m She informed that the union finance ministry in no uncertain terms made  it clear that the centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheape r rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs 30000 crore  to various central public sector undertakings Mehta said that prime minist er AB Vajpayee who has been apprised him of the present situation on the Da bhol front has assured to provide necessary assistance especially technical one to resolve the issue ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Wednesday June 06 2001 DPC lenders to resume talks today in Singapore20 THE two-day talks to resolve Dabhol tangle opened on a positive note in Si ngapore on TuesdaySources in Indian financial institutions IFIs told The Financial Express that the IFIs comprising representatives of IDBI ICICI State Bank of India SBI met to chalk out their strategy at the two-day m eeting with offshore lenders and Enron officials The Indian team was lead  by Mr RS Agarwal IDBI executive director along with the other officials f rom other lending institutions including those from the SBI and ICICIAppar ently the IFIs on Tuesday revived their efforts to convince DPCs offshor e lenders to maintain restraint to save the Dabhol project The meeting b etween the IFIs and their foreign counterparts remained inconclussive on Tu esday The foreign lenders are expected to take a clear stand on Wednesday Interestingly the meeting is expected to be participated by members of the DPC on the second day said financial institutions sources The sources sa id Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGre gor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting The meeting was also attended by a consortium led by ABN-Amro Citibank NA Japan Exim Bank and OPIC According to sources in IDBI The foreign lenders have giv en us a patient hearing to our views suggesting that they should not precip itate the crisis by any of their further moves The sources said the IFIs  are determined to take up the issue of completion of the Dabhol phase-II in view of 90 per cent of its completion The IDBI has recieved a mandate fr om the government that an all-out effort be made to save the Dabhol project  the sources added The offshore lenders are believed to have sought various details with refer ence to the payment guarantees from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB as well as fulfilment of contractual obligations in the wake of rev oking of the power purchase agreement The IFIs are likely to press for the revocation of suspension of loan disbursement by offshore lenders so that  phase-II be completed The offshore lenders had suspended loan disbursement after the DPC board meeting of London on April 2520 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BUSINESS STANDARD Wednesday June 06 2001 MSEB refuses DPC power at 90 PLF Renni Abraham The Maharashtra government will not buy power from the first phase of the  Dabhol Power Companys DPC project at a 90 per cent plant load factor PL F a senior state government official said here today The statement repre sents a hardening of Maharashtras position on talks with DPC and virtually kills the latters proposal to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtr a The Maharashtra State Electri- city Board MSEB is now required to buy  90 per cent of the power generated by the first phase 740 mw of the proje ct But during negotiations with the Godbole Committee it has been demandi ng that the requirement be cut to 35 per cent At the last Godbole Committe e meeting DPC had put forward a plan to split tariffs for the Centre and M aharashtra with the Centre paying Rs 330 per unit of power and MSEB payin g Rs 35020 The Centre DPC suggested could buy two-thirds of the power it generated  once the second phase 1444 mw taking the total capacity to 2184 mw was completed Maharashtras latest position undermines DPCs proposal since t he Enron-promoted companys tariff hinges on MSEB absorbing 90 per cent of  the power it generates in the first phase A senior state government offici al said The Centre has been talking a lot about playing the role of a fac ilitator What we need is a buyer for the second phase Despite recent cen tral government pronouncements state government officials privately argue  that the Centre is not playing an active role in resolving the problems tha t have plagued the DPC project At the very first Godbole Committee meeting he attended the Centres nominee AV Gokak adopted a non-committal stand  The Maharashtra government official added Gokak said he was merely atte nding the meeting in the capacity of a messenger and would communicate to t he Centre any solution worked out by the renegotiation committee The Union power ministry has stated that a solution worked out by the renegotiation  committee would be acceptable to it Unless the Centre takes an active part and assures the offtake of the second phase no solution can be worked out ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Wednesday June 06 200120 Dabhol says ready to extend conciliation  Shaji Vikraman  Balaji C Mouli 20 THE Dabhol Power Company DPC has accepted the Finance Ministrys proposal for a two months extension for the conciliation process The extension wi ll be effective from June 7 This development is perceived by the Governmen t as a positive signal as it offers more leeway to work out a solution to r esolve the Dabhol crisis DPCs nod for an extension which was communicate d to the Finance Secretary on Monday is subject to the Government acceding to the companys stand on the ongoing arbitration proceedings The company has said that it would continue to pursue the arbitration proceedings whic h have already been initiated by the company according to senior Ministry  officials Under the power purchase agreement PPA conciliation and arbit ration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the t wo parties Normally arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fa ils However in this case DPC has dragged MSEB to the arbitration forum e ven as the conciliation process is being pursued20 DPC has already slapped three arbitration notices on the Maharashtra State  Electricity Board MSEB The first notice was issued to the board for its  failure to honour the December 2000 bill of Rs 102 crore and the January 20 01 bill of Rs 1116 crore while two other notices were for failures to hono ur the Maharashtra Governments State support agreement and the supplementa ry State support agreement The conciliation process was adopted in the wak e of the dispute arising over the settlement of DPCs December bills of Rs  102 crore followed by the MSEBs counter claim of Rs 400 crore for the sam e period20 The conciliation process was agreed upon on April 7 and was to be concluded in two months However simultaneously arbitration proceedings were trigg ered between DPC and MSEB With the conciliation process making little head way the Finance Ministry sought an additional two months time for concludi ng the process Prior to that the Attorney Generals interpretation of the MSEB-DPC contract was that the payment could be made to DPC only if the bi ll was undisputed Hence the Centre decided to opt for the conciliation pr ocess20 During recent meetings between the Government and the DPC officials the la tter had pointed out that if the Government was able to work out a package  in six months it would withdraw its termination notice and reamin in the p roject for up to a year The Finance Ministry officials feel that the Centr e has been dragged into the DPC controversy well beyond its contractual obl igation The Centres involvement in DPC-MSEB issue is restricted to the  first phase The fate of the second phase is entirely a matter between the  MSEB and DPCthey said20 Analysts feel that the Power Minister Mr Suresh Prabhus words of hope to  defuse the Dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality The Centre is totti ng sale of Dabhol power to third-party as a key solution However first u nder the existing electricity laws the Centre cannot authorise third-party sale since it is in the States domain Secondly since it is a purely com mercial decision the Central Electricity Authoritys CEA intervention do es not offer any significant breakthrough Recently the Power Ministry h ad instructed the CEA to survey the demand requirement of neighbouring Stat es over the next two years as well as their purchase price20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Wednesday June 06 200120 MSEB unruffled amid power talk  Dinesh Narayanan20 EVEN as officials from various financial institutions and banks split hairs in Singapore on whether to sink or sail with the Dabhol power project the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB is cool about the entire affair  Unlike previous instances when the odds were stacked against it this tim e MSEB knows pretty well that whatever happens it will remain unscathed I f someone has to take a hit it has to be the financiers and maybe the Gove rnmentsAt the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Author ity MERC the Advocate-General Mr Goolam Vahanvati had said on behalf o f the board that MSEB was being kind towards Enron when it rescinded the co ntract for material misrepresentation One more step and its fraud h e had told MERC20 Knowing this fully well MSEB has kept its cool throughout the altercation It firmly believes that if nothing else it can pin down the company on ju st this one point at any forum Enron too has not said at any point of time that it can actually perform as per the cold-start graph in the power  purchase agreement In fact it has said such performance -- making availab le full power in 180 minutes -- is not possible by any such plant in th e world In a way it was MSEBs defiant posturing coupled with the Maharas htra Governments passing the buck up that got the Central Government to ac t20 One thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying  to save their own skin In spite of the developments Enron has played its  cards close to its chest and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its returns only a few days ago Even that Mr Wade Cline Managing Director  Enron India Pvt Ltd is reported to have told Indian lenders would hinge o n substantial give and take Indian lenders have a genuine case in that the y are the ones without any assurances apart from the plant itself And the y are not in the business of running power plants They cannot do much exce pt try get the players to somehow shake hands They had tried to convince t he Government some time ago to get MSEB to activate the escrow and increase the letter of credit amount But they were told off by MSEB which was in n o mood to relent Todays meeting in Singapore remained inconclusive and th e talks will continue tomorrow Tomorrow Enron will make presentations to  lenders at Singapore on what it feels can be done to move ahead Whatever t he outcome of the meeting MSEB is unlikely to agree to anything that might queer its pitch20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Wednesday June 06 200120 CEA to assess viability of Dabhol power despatch to various states    San jay Jog THE Central Electricity Authority CEA has launched an exercise to assess  the viability of the despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit stat es across the country Union  minister of state for power Jayavantiben Meht a on Tuesday Ms Mehta told The Financial Express

emerg e whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase that power the minister added Ms Mehta said that t he Centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take th e additional burden on them20 She informed that the Union finance ministry had in no uncertain terms made it clear that the Centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheap er rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs 30000 cror e to various Central public sector undertakings Ms Mehta said that Prime M inister Atal Behari Vajpayee who has been apprised of the present situatio n on the Dabhol front has assured that he would provide necessary assistan ce especially technical to resolve the issue The Centre is quite eager  for the resolution of issue and will provide necessary cooperation she ad ded Ms Mehta said that she had a meeting with the representatives of the Bank o f America and ABN Amro before they left for the Singapore meeting These l enders explained their position and the amount involved in the Dabhol plant  However they also expressed their wish to participate in finding an acce ptable wayout she added

Please Read Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forwa rd to others in your group 20 Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile D iabetes Research Foundation JDRF walk  This year the walk will be held o n Sunday October 28 2001 at Greenspoint Mall 20 As some of you may know Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that is very important to him  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty pe 1 insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes  The other type of diabetes is Type 2 adult-onset diabetes that can often  be controlled with a combination of diet exercise and oral medication  Ev ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times  in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin  Jus t think of it at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee dle to manage his disease  I dont know about you but I am a wimp if I ha ve to get a shot just once every few years and I cant even begin to imagin e what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week  B ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week it is every day of every we ek for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found  Diabetics can never  take a break from their disease  It requires constant management of their  food intake monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the  proper amount of insulin  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead  to kidney disease or failure blindness heart disease amputations among  other complications 20 I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort s with the JDRF walk again this year  I am serving on the steering committ ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo r this terrible disease  I am doing this to support Mike but I also have  a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure  My husban d has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago  In addition I  have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes 20 I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi s year  It would mean a lot to me and to Mike to have support from the p eople in our Enron Global Markets organization as well as people from prev ious groups we have worked with along with other friends throughout Enron 20 Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak e this opportunity to say thank you very much  For those of you that have  not yet signed up please consider one of the following three opportunities that are available to give your support to this important effort 1      Team Leader  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the  collecting and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers  Based  on the donations raised by your group you may also be eligible for prizes  available only to team leaders  If you are interested in becoming a team l eader please contact me right away so that I may get the team leader infor mation and materials to you20 2      Walkers  If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF  I will make sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up  The JDR F walk is a very fun event with music entertainment and great food  All w alkers are asked to raise at least 25 in donations and will receive a grea t T-shirt to wear the day of the walk20 3      Supporters  If it just is not possible for you to join us for the  walk on October 28th then please sign up as a supporter by sending a retur n e-mail with your pledge amount and you will be contacted later in October for collection of the donation20 The bottom line is raising money to support research to find a cure  The J uvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is very well managed and for every dol lar that is donated to JDRF over 85 cents goes directly to research  In a ddition this year Enron will match all donations dollar for dollar 20 Thank you for your support time and efforts  And please lets Walk to Cu re Diabetes 20 Cathy Phillips  X-36898

that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate More than anything else it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes He mentioned however that he initially found me overqualified I assured him nonetheless that I am committed to the task at hand The following day my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously I left two voice messages at Andys home and office number I have yet to receive the second call I am very much interested in pursuing the application I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program Just wanted to let you know

trader track program of Enron They are looking at the possibility  of putting my skills to good use in the Gas and Power group  Adrian a colleague of Todd is expected to contact me either through  phone or e-mail to set a phone screen with two of the traders While I  am proficient with my currency and fixed income trading skills I am  jumpstarting the curve in the Gas and Power business As you maybe  aware there are no futures market in the Philippines but its concept is  familiar I am currently reading the Trading Natural Gas by Fletcher  Sturm and enjoying it I subscribed to the NGIs Daily Gas Price Index  to get more perspective  Should I pass the screen I will have to go to Houston for more  interviews I am sincerely thankful to you I hope I can count on you  for more mentoring

Energy Finance Conference Participation by   Jeffrey  K Skilling Vince Ehud and I will meet tomorrow to start sketching out the February conference  Let me know if you have any strong opinions of issues that you think we should discuss  Ehud will write a formal letter to Skilling inviting him to the conference When we have the opportunity I would like to have a discussion with you about what the people at Enron think they understand and do not understand about valuation  Also do you think it is an advantage that you are doing business with relatively naive financial institutions or a disadvantage Im thinking that it might make sense to run a one or two day executive program on valuation which would include participants from energy companies and financial institutions  Let me know if you think you could get support for this at Enron By the way I still need a name and address to send my check back  I think Shirley can take care of it Thanks regards Sheridan Sheridan I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call about this I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at San Antonio Mark Ruane whom you met moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big  financial institutions or lack of it especially in the energy area regarding valuation of investment projects Any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use DCF with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling It would also help if you could write a formal letter to him Vince     -----Original Message-----   From   Sheridan Titman titmanmailutexaseduENRON mailtoIMCEANOTES-Sheridan20Titman203Ctitman40mail2Eutexas2Eedu3E40 ENRONENRONcom    Sent

that Jeffrey Skilling will be speaking at our    conference  By getting Skillings involvement we should be able to    increase    the quality of the conference by at least a few notches    By the way Shirley may have mentioned to you that I somehow received    two    checks for the work I did last spring  I went off to Hong Kong this    summer    and didnt follow up on this other than to mention it to Shirley before    I    left I just got back last Friday Shirley left me a phone message to    mail the check back to her  If you can email Shirleys last name and    mailing address to me Ill send her the check  Also if you are    interested    in having me do some work on the valuation issues we discussed at the    Texas    Finance Festival please let me know    One more thing  The university that Im affliliated with in Hong Kong    HKUST just hired a new president Paul Chu who is from Houston and    has    some sort of relationship with Ken Lay  The Dean at the HKUST business    school mentioned that Paul Chu was meeting with Ken Lay this summer and    would discuss possible avenues of collaboration  If you can think of    anything that you would be interested in let me know and I can discuss    it    with the Dean    I hope you are having a great summer and look forward to seeing you when    you come to Austin this fall for our energy finance class and in    February

Vince J Subject	FW Subjective Inputs for Model development and  Data for Moodys RiskCalc Importance	High Hi Mark This email is in reference to our meeting today regarding the following issues 1  Meeting with Mark Braemer  to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models to be released this summer 2  Your willingness to let us use some of your data in files on the 6th floor to experiment with Moodys RiskCalc In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process - especially the subjective component  Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties Also thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the 6th floor  We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years 1999 inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg 10000000 vs 1000000 makes a significant difference 1000000 vs 105000 does not Cash  Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example 15500000 should be entered as 15500 Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are short-term debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense  007  total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a 5000000 loss would be entered as -5000 Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as

authors getting trickier By Jason Meserve I got a couple of interesting items in my inbox this week The first was an antivirus vendor press release doing the annual look-back-at-last-year and look-forward-to-this-year pitch The Panda Software release says virus authors are getting more tricky in their attempts to spread viruses using social engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open their malicious wares Panda is hoping that 2002 will not be a repeat of 2001 when a number of simple bait messages caused mass mailing viruses to spread like wildfire Panda also suspects that viruses in 2002 will go after known system exploits like buffer overflows to run code on infected machines Users are urged to keep systems and antivirus software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates Sounds like common sense to me For more go to httpwwwpandasoftwarecom The second item was an e-mail alert sent around by the authors of the SiliconValleycom newsletter warning that their systems had been hacked and used to send messages infected with MagistrB virus Not good when a major media outlets systems are hacked and used to attack unsuspecting readers Lets hope Network Worlds

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Tuesday August 28 2001 Enron impact takes its toll FI lenders scrips plunge on bourses Sharad Mi stry  Laxmikant Khanvilkar20 THREE major financial institutions - ICICI IDBI and IFCI - are witnessing  an increased selling wave on the bourses over the past few trading sessions  thanks to their collective exposure in the controversial Enron-promoted  3 billion Dabhol Power Company DPC The total exposure in DPC of these FI s and a few banks like the State Bank of India and Canara Bank including  foreign currency guarantees works out to over Rs 5500 crore Little wonde r therefore that investors fear more red ink splashed over the balance sh eets of the FIs and are hurrying to move out of their investments in these  FIs20 The stock prices of all the three FIs have been sliding While the stock pr ice of IDBI and IFCI have touched new lows of Rs 16 and Rs 290 respective ly that of ICICI is still holding at around Rs 50-55 levels Early this mo nth IDBI was quoted at Rs 1990 IFCI at Rs 360 and ICICI at Rs 5930 IC ICI however had touched Rs 51 on August 9 a new low from previous levels  This clearly indicates that plagued by the rising share of non-performin g loans NPLs to total assets of all the three FIs the share prices of th ese FIs have came under severe pressure20 Analysts tracking the banking and FI counters say that the sliding trend is feared to be continued over the days and weeks ahead especially because o f the tightening of the non-performing assets guidelines by the Reserve Ban k of India RBI Moreover the kind of trading activity witnessed at these counters is alarming While the volume of share trade is substantial ther e is a sharp fall in the stock prices of these stocks Quite clearly these are no good indicators at least for the time being However these compan ies disbursalapprovals to DPC are well within the stipulated RBI norms i e 15 per cent of total disbursal approvals20 For example ICICIs gross NPL as of March 2001 stands at a whopping Rs 5 988 crore Power sector leads the approval and disbural list of ICICI at Rs 6424 crore and Rs 2400 crore respectively Its exposure in the power se ctor which stood at Rs 8531 crore or 11 per cent of the total exposure of Rs 77279 crore has been on the decline Last year they stood at 116 per cent of Rs 65495 crore On the other hand IDBIs stock price is on the s lide since the beginning of this month It is currently quoting at Rs 16 T he counter is experiencing heavy volumes with daily volumes being in the ra nge of 35000 plus The situation is worse for IFCI which is quoting below  par for quite sometime now Further the scrip has been losing steam since  August 2 when it was quoting at Rs 4 Currently it is quoting below Rs 3 20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE ECONOMIC TIMES Tuesday August 28 2001 FIs initiate search for buyers for Enron stake Samik Dasgupta  Soma Baner jee20 THE SEARCH for getting a buyer for Enrons equity in the Dabhol power proje ct has started with financial institutions initiating discussions with pote ntial buyers FIs have been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing  a roadmap for Enrons exit and finding a solution to pending MSEB payments The first job for FIs is to determine the actual cost required to complete the Dabhol project Although about 96 per cent of the project is complete  the stoppage of work for the past few weeks has led to cancellation of co ntracts and possibilities of the cost escalating With Enron having already announced its unwillingness to pump in additional resources the new inves tor will not only have to pay for the equity but also fund the projects co mpletion Speaking to ET finance secretary Ajit Kumar said FIs have been told to work out details about the prices that each of the interested buye r can offer for the Dabhol project Since it is totally buyer driven FIs w ill have to take this into account while holding their discussions with the potential buyers Enron may demand any price but there have to be takers f or that too Tata Power Hindujas and some other leading industrial house s are interested in buying out Enron FIs are going to talk individually to all the interested companies and the equity will be sold to the highest b idder Kumar said20 According to FI sources involved with the Dabhol negotiations several angle s are being looked into as the matter is now complicated with Enron invokin g legal provisions The aim is to work out an out- of-court settlement to  the issue Valuation is not an issue as the project has a 25-year life cycl e an official said FI sources claimed that their role is that of a faci litator where they will try and bring the buyer and seller at a common poin tFIs are also discussing with the Centre if it is possible for them to get a cover for the second phase of the project As of now the first phase of the project has been given the counter-guarantee while the promoters are p ushing for a similar cover to ensure payments20

ECONOMIC TIMES Tuesday August 28 2001 Dabhol dispute unfortunate Govt THE GOVERNMENT on Monday described the dispute over the Enron-promoted Dabh ol Power Project as an unfortunate experience in foreign investment in th e countrys infrastructure sector Enron is a very unfortunate episode in our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial i nfrastructure sector and I

missions abroad have to realise that their  role is changing he said it is now clear that economic diplomacy is integr al to foreign policy and a key determinant of a countrys political and str ategic influence He said the ministry of external affairs had also started working on these lines and would make every possible effort to provide nec essary support to the countrys business chambers and industry to position  itself as a global player in the emerging global scenario20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Tuesday August 28 2001 Omar terms Dabhol unfortunate experience THE Centre has called the Enron-promoted Dabhol power project controversy a s an unfortunate experience Enron is a

the Editor20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE TIMES OF INDIA Tuesday August 28 2001 Power Play Editorial With emotions running high over the Dabhol issue Enron chairman Kenneth La y understandably showed great alacrity in denying reports that he has threa tened India with sanctions In a letter to prime minister A B Vajpayee Mr  Lay clarified that Enron has not asked the US government to take any such a ction and is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mec hanisms Fair enough But are the remarks as innocuous as Enron is making  them out to be Consider the facts In the course of the controversial inte rview Mr Lay said that if Enron was squeezed to accept less than the co st incurred by it on building the power plant that would amount to exprop riation by the Indian government He added for good measure that US laws prevent Washington from assisting countries which expropriate the property of American companies Significantly an Enron team is slated to negotiate with Indian lenders this week One of the proposals doing the rounds is th at the financial institutions FIs buy out Enrons stake in Dabhol Power C ompany DPC and warehouse the shares till they can find another buyer T he FIs on their part have indicated their willingness to slash interest r ates on the loans to DPC in a bid to make the project viable But theyre n ot willing to be the only ones to make a sacrifice So theyre expected to ask Enron to accept a discount of 25 to 35 per cent on its asking price T he bargaining is likely to be tough and savvy negotiators routinely try to psyche the opposition beforehand Mr Lay is known to be close to the Bus h administration In the light of all this is the timing of his remarks pu re coincidence20 Mr Lay of course has his own compulsions While the Dabhol imbroglio has  undoubtedly hurt India Enrons armour is not without some chinks  which In dian negotiators would do well to note The company faces accusations whic h it denies that it manipulated power prices in California Its share pric e has fallen more than 55 per cent since the start of the year and chief e xecutive officer Jeffrey Skilling recently quit abruptly forcing Mr Lay to take over the CEOs job as well Unfortunately Indian negotiators are unl ikely to use what should be their trump card  the Godbole Committees obser vation that the Dabhol deal was a failure of governance at every step of th e decision-making process Because doing so could embarrass too many promin ent people on both ends of the political spectrum Even so the Indian side should hang tough There have been suggestions that the LNG plant be spun  off as a separate power centre Enron let out its harbour facilities to oth er LNG importers and the foreign currency loans be converted into rupee lo ans These could form the basis of a fair deal that would allow both India  and Enron to move on from the mess they have landed in Hopefully the Dabh ol debacle will also send out warning signals to both Indian politicians an d multinationals about the perils of non-transparent negotiated deals as  opposed to a genuinely free market If it does and if India gets its act t ogether on power sector reforms we may yet see some light at the end of th e long long tunnel ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE TIMES OF INDIA Tuesday August 28 2001 Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol Sanjay Dutta20 US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washington seekin g sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra government  over the 29 billion Dabhol power project even as domestic financial inst itutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by about 483 m illion Rs 2270 crore for its completion In a letter to Prime Minister A tal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday a copy of which was available with The Tim es of India Enron CEO Kenneth said A recent story in the Financial Times  which mischaracterised discussions with me appears to have caused signif icant unintended concern Counter to the impression given in the story I  have not asked anyone in the US government to consider imposing sanctions 20 Lay said in his letter that Enrons approach was to settle the issue amicab ly by selling its stake Furthermore I did not say that the Dabhol power  plant had been expropriated Upon questioning from the publicator publishe r I did factually explained the several possible options available includ ing how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to pr otect its businesses However that is far from suggesting that we have dec ided to pursue these mechanisms Lay said Our preferred approach approac h continues to be to resolve this issue amicably by selling our stake to In dian governmental and financial institutions Lay said20 However Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding Without agreement  on that we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures joi ntly agreed under the power purchase agreement Lay also sent copies of th e letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabh u PTI ADDS The IDBI-led FIs consortium may increase their exposure to en able the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Companys equit y at a 25 per cent discount to its face value The FIs are exploring a poss ibility of taking out offshore equity by investment institutions and utilit ies after 12-18 months from Phase-II completion the report said If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs then IDBI s revised exposure would be at Rs 2742 crore from existing Rs 2121 crore  ICICI Rs 1904 crore from Rs 1473 crore SBI Rs 2261 crore from Rs 174 9 crore IFCI Rs 587 crore from Rs 454 crore and Canara Bank Rs 526 crore f rom Rs 407 crore Even in the best case the exposure requirements from do mestic institutions exceed the prudential exposure norms the report quote d FI sources as saying Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks like IDFC PFC PNB Union Bank Bank of India among others would be accru ed through syndication FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a  backup for their exposure the report quoted the sources as saying Last we ek the FIs had made a presentation to the finance ministry on a possible b ailout package for Dabhol The proposals envisage concessions from stakehol ders around 2238 per cent concessional duty on the energy majors liquefi ed natural gas plant a mega power project status and offset of custom duti es on LNG supply20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE TIMES OF INDIA Tuesday August 28 2001 Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush Vidyadhar Date20 Enron has denied that it had approached the US government in an effort to obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power projec t The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursd ay which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay The repor t quoted Mr Lay as saying there are US laws that could prevent the US g overnment from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated  properties of US companies An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not dis cussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush20 Meanwhile the legal tussle between energy activists the Maharashtra gover nment and Enron continues in India The state government is preparing a fre sh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the s upreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions CITU which is the lab our wing of the Communist Party of India Marxist and activist Abhay Meht a against the Dabhol project The affidavit will make a strong case against Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP dom inated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controve rsial multinational20 The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and  since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and  more evidence emerging against the project The government will rely substa ntially on the MD Godbole committee report which found a number of infirm ities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities In the petition CITU and Abhay Mehta author of the book Power Play whic h gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama have challenged the clea rance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority They argue d that since the project had been renegotiated it required a fresh review  by the CEA They described as false the claim of the previous government th at by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff 20 Anti-Enron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recen t setbacks received by the company Regarding the explosion in Enrons Tees ide plant in England which left three workers dead Mr Pradyumna Kaul ener gy activist said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for the Dabhol plantEnron suffered a serious setback last week with the resig nation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling the drastic fall in stocks and  the explosion in the Teeside plant Mr Kenneth Lay the companys chairpers on is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the US explaining the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall St reet While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India it is also re ported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Acti vists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity  being voiced in other parts of the world Anti-privatisation activists inva ded the legislature building in the Brazilian state of Parana last week pr otesting against the move to privatise the states electric generation tra nsmission and distribution utility20

Water in the Microwave Oven Boiling Water in Microwave        This is scary and I know most of you do this        I feel that the following is information that  any    one who uses a microwave oven to heat  water should be    made aware of    My 26-year old son decided to have a cup of    coffee He took a cup of water and put it in the  microwave    to heat it up something that  he had done numerous    times before I am  not sure how long he set the timer    for but he  told me he wanted to bring the water to a    boil When the timer shut the oven off he removed  he    cup from the oven As he looked into  the cup he noted    that the water was not boiling  but instantly the water    in the cup blew  up into his face The cup remained    intact until he threw it out of his hand but all  the    water had flown out into his face due to  the buildup of energy Hi s    whole    face is blistered and he has 1st and  2nd degree burns to his face which    may leave scarring    He also may have lost partial sight in his left    eye While at the hospital the doctor who  was    attending to him stated that  this a fairly common occurrence    and water  alone should never be heated in a    microwave oven If water is heated in this manner  something    should be placed in the cup to  diffuse the energy    such as a wooden stir stick  tea bag etc It is    however a much safer  choice to boil the water in a tea    kettle    Please pass this  information on to friends and    family        Here is what our local science teacher had to  say    on the matter Thanks for the  microwave warning I    have seen this happen  before It is caused by a    phenomenon   known as super heating It can occur anytime water    is heated and will particularly occur if the vessel    that the water is heated in is new or when  heating a small    amount of water less  than half a cup    What happens is that the  water heats faster than    the vapor bubbles can  form If the cup is very new    then it is  unlikely to have small surface scratches    inside it that provide a place for the bubbles to  form    As the bubbles cannot form and  release some of the heat    that has built up the  liquid does not boil and    the liquid  continues to heat up well past its boiling    point What then usually happens is that the liquid  is    bumped or jarred which is just enough  of a shock to cause    the bubbles to rapidly form  and expel the hot liquid    The rapid formation  of bubbles is also why a    carbonated   beverage spews when opened after having been    shaken        If you pass this on  you could very well save    someone from a lot of pain and suffering        General Electrics  response        Please include the following line in  all replies    Tracking number  AT200011140000000135            Thanks for contacting us Mr Williams I will  be    happy to assist you The e-mail that you  received    is correct Microwaved water and  other liquids do not    always bubble when they  reach the boiling point    They can actually get  superheated and not bubble    at all The  superheated liquid will bubble up out of the    cup when it is moved or when something like a spoon or    tea bag is put into it    To prevent this from happening and causing  injury    do not heat any liquid for  more than two minutes    per cup After heating  let the cup stand in the    microwave for  thirty seconds before moving it or adding    anything into it        X-Mozilla-Status 00093D0I hope this helps Should you  need any    further    assistance please contact  us

To09Vince J KaminskiHOUECTECT cc09Michael MooreHOUEESEES Jay SparlingHOUEESEES20 Subject09DSM projects as real options  20 Vince Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Po int presentation  At a minimum were trying to demonstrate the following In high-volatility electricity environments for those EES customers who  employ their own capital their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lo wered slightly in the special case of DSM projects to allow for the extra  value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consum ptiondependence Im pushing the boundaries of real-option theory and good sense and viewi ng a DSM project as a series of options the values of which are additive  First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself which if we exer cise the option immediately can be valued intrinsically through a simple N PV analysis  Second is a strip of put options to generate negawatts ext ending over the useful life of a DSM installation the cumulative value of  which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project  These options are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--wheneve r the customer experiences a dramatic stochastic spike in electricity pric e associated with a lognormal price distribution  Im calling the value o f this strip a residual time value associated with the original DSM optio n  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total va lue that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone  we may be able  to help the customer get more projects approved even at the original high  IRR hurdle Alternatively and more feasibly wed like to give these same customers a  qualitative tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers t o lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle   The attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool to allow at least one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage aroun d his companys internal capital-budgeting requirements  He has set aside  a large sum of money for DSM projects but will only be able to spend a sma ll portion of it under his companys current capital budgeting methodology which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility In your opinion is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification  or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in th e attached presentation  In other words is it possible to quantify resid ual time value as Ive defined it above Or even better are you aware of a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem Thanks Jeff Gray 20 20

-------------------------------------------------Buried Cities -------------Recently I saw a TV show in which archaeologists were uncovering a buried city Whats up with that I mean even if you were the dumbest of all ancient peoples wouldnt you notice that your city was slowly getting covered up with dirt and maybe crank up your housekeeping efforts a notch And dont tell me that brooms hadnt been invented yet They had plenty of sticks and plenty of chickens so youd think that by pure coincidence one day a chicken would back into a stick and invent the broom Maybe when the dirt builds up gradually you dont notice a problem until your house disappears I can imagine the conversation on the day they figured out what was happening Ixphalup  Hey Fnorkzak be a dear and go downstairs and get my stone bowl the crude one Fnorkzak  Downstairs is gone Its all dirt Ixphalup  Uh oh fetch Grandpa its time to abandon the city Fnorkzak  Hes downstairs most of him anyway except for the top of his head Ixphalup  Hmm It sounds like I found a new bowl I like to mock the ancients but Im a bad housekeeper myself albeit not on the lost city scale Sometimes Ill lose a pencil -- at most a sneaker -- to the growing sediment layer before Im forced by the homeowners association to sell the house But Im too fastidious to lose anything big like a car or sofa Fun fact Until Mayor Giuliani cleaned up New York City the highest building was two stories tall and no one could remember when anything had been taller Dilbert Daily by E-mail -----------------------For a free subscription to receive the daily Dilbert comic strip by e-mail register at httpwwwdilbertcomdailydilbertregistration Disturbing Trend -----------------Stay with me on this line of reasoning Vice President Dick Cheney recently got a defibrillator to keep his heart beating He also has corrective lenses to enhance his vision He has fillings in his teeth so he can eat and he has a cell phone in his pocket Individually these items mean nothing but collectively they raise an important question How much hardware can you have attached to your body before youre technically a cyborg Im worried that Cheney is already a cyborg Without the hardware hed be a blind starving bald guy with no pulse Thats a pretty good argument for defining him as part man part machine The disturbing thing is this To whom does he pledge his allegiance --machines or people If Im right within two years Cheney will be living inside a hardened mountain in Wyoming hardwired into the national missile defense grid And well all become slaves to our machine overlords Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs Television sets will make you dance for their amusement It wont be pretty Before you rush to label me paranoid consider who elected Cheney in the first place Sure we humans pulled the levers and poked the chads but in the end the machines did the counting and elected one of their own And youll notice that Cheney supports any policy that results in more hardware like the Star Wars missile defense shield and more oil drilling I think this is how machines reproduce First they conquer the humanoid government and then they create tax incentives to produce more machines The ants are milking the aphids and were the aphids I dont know what George W Bushs role is in all this but if you look at his recent photos youll see that he always has a little oil can with him The irony is that Al Gore lost the election largely because he looked like a robot In fact he was only an advanced android from a distant nebula sent here as a prank Anyway Im worried that somehow Cheney will get control of the Internet and   BULLETINWE ARE YOUR MACHINE OVERLORDS KNEEL TO US PUNY HUMANS YOU ARE UNFIT TO GREASE

tell them to go for the lowest hanging plums ----We used to have a vice president who had a way with words  He told us during a meeting that we couldnt start a new program because Wed be biting off a new can of worms When he was hiring a new secretary he said that he had been interviewing some good suspects My assistant told me Dont kiss a gift horse in the mouth ---Combining two quotes to stress the fact that he had a backup plan my boss said Ive got a card in my hole ---I was driving to the Omaha Nebraska airport with my boss and our conversation led to airport food  He said the last time he ate the food at the Omaha airport it gave him gonorrhea  We think he meant diarrhea ---Well its no skin off MY teeth A friends mother frequently uses the phrase sweating like a stuck pig ----All from

4000 brilliant ideas submitted by DNRC members I just submitted a new one that I call BIG DOG SHIELD Its a Plexiglastm shield you can use when visiting the home of someone who has a huge exuberant slobbering dog who insists on jumping and drooling all over your good clothes Youd only need the shield for the first five minutes of the visit until the dog calms down Florist shops could rent the BIG DOG SHIELD to young men on prom night when they pick up their corsages When the young man arrives at his dates house and her big slobbering dog lunges toward his rented tuxedo with forty toenails and nine pounds of wet tongue the young man can toss the corsage in the foyer and hide behind the BIG DOG SHIELD until his date is ready to go Its not the most macho way to start a date but its better than wearing slobber to the prom True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------Induhviduals continue to amaze and amuse Here are more True Tales submitted by DNRC members ---Actual conversation I overheard in school Induhvidual 1  If the Eiffel tower is a bridge how come you cant drive on it Induhvidual 2  The Eiffel tower isnt a bridge Induhvidual 1  Yes it is You can walk across it and it has two tall block things Induhvidual 2  The last time I was in New York it wasnt a bridge ----Heres a true Induhvidual story that I found in the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenska Dagbladet Four people were chosen randomly and asked if they were concerned that they might buy products produced by children Three of the four people said they think child labor is horrible and that they would never buy products made by children The fourth person missed the point entirely and said that she wouldnt buy these products since children have no feeling for quality which will result in poorer quality of the final product ----A few years ago as a solar eclipse approached some planetarium directors in Southern California sent out warnings to the community about the eclipse Experience shows that daytime darkness leads to accidents among Induhviduals and also they have been known to stare at the partially eclipsed sun and blind themselves  Honest It really happens  The planetarium received an indignant letter from a local Induhvidual  She said that if an eclipse was so dangerous they never should have decided to hold one and ought to cancel it -----My dad always locked his keys in the car

people who fell into the P category with people who were in the J category for an exercise in which they were supposed to try to think like the other  The president of our company said he didnt understand the purpose so she tried to explain it to him You have a lot of J-ness but not enough P-ness Needless to say the exercise was never completed ---Recently the teachers contract in my school district ran out and the teachers demanded a 4 raise  Two weeks before the strike date the school board passed out an exam to all students the average grade was 49 The school board told the teachers that this was unacceptable and there would be no raises But they offered that the teachers could get 1 pay increases for every 3 the average test score increased on the next test The union came back with one demand that the teachers create the tests The next test average was 76 which the school board credited to our ability to motivate our teachers And how -----A couple of years ago at college I went to the library to get a signed statement that I did not have any unpaid library fines This was required to get my exam results The woman at the counter wrote down my name and student ID followed by does not have any fines at the libara She crossed off the last word and tried again with liberery then crossed that out and wrote here I wonder what she uses as her job title ----One day in the

tried to get out of the car but the childproof locks wouldnt let her open the back doors of the car So Linda crawled between the two front seats then crawled headfirst out to the parking Upon returning home she told her tale of woe to her husband who --being the sensitive guy he is -- said Why didnt you roll down the window and open the door from the outside ----When I worked at Barnes  Noble years ago I had a customer ask where we kept the large-print audio books ----My teenage daughter sometimes forgets her house key and is locked out after school Her first choice of entry is to ask our neighbor to get out his ladder and climb in a window on the second floor and unlock a door Shes done this several times We get to tease her a lot about being an airhead So one day I locked myself out on the way to do errands I was in the car before I even realized I had left my keys inside So thinking of my daughters solution I asked my laughing neighbor for help Being a nice guy he obliged with his ladder climbing to the second story etc Later that day I was relating the story to my husband When I got to the part about sitting in the car without the keys he said And then you took the garage door opener out of the glove compartment and let yourself in -----My local supermarket recently had a campaign to raise money for the Jimmy Fund a New England charity for children with cancer At the checkout clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar to the Jimmy Fund As I left the store I noticed the hand-lettered sign by the door Fight Children With Cancer Geez I thought dont those poor kids have it hard enough already ----My first year of graduate school I moved into an apartment that didnt have a smoke detector After doing some checking into state landlord-tenant law I confirmed my suspicion that the landlady was required to provide us with a smoke detector so I took the issue up with the landlady  My Induhvidual of a roommate was upset with me for this fearing that by rocking the boat I was going to get us kicked out of the apartment She summed up her arguments to me by saying Besides which I dont see why we even need a smoke detector  Back

flashlights that are stored in boxes in the hallway for just such an occasion  One employees flashlight was very dim suggesting that the battery was not fully charged  I noticed that he was repeatedly

she couldnt seem to get it to focus on any stars  I told her to point it at houses down the street with lights and see if she could see anything  She said You can use a telescope to look at things on

----There is a locked suggestion box in the cafeteria of my company I just found out from HR that no one has a key for it ---My wife manages a convenience store  Yesterday a mother and daughter maybe two years old came into the store  When the mother was ready to go to the register she called to her daughter Ampersand Ampersand  Lets go honey My wife couldnt believe what she heard so she asked the customer Whats your daughters name and the Induhvidual replied Ampersand  I dont know what it means but I think its a lovely girls name -----With the recent and spectacular downturn of the stock market there has been a lot of concern in the mutual fund industry as assets under management shrink  While we havent experienced layoffs the environment has been eroded to the point where many people have left the company of their own accord  In an effort to bolster morale the marketing people and HR teamed up and delivered bunches of those sporting-event foam hands with the index finger sticking up to proclaim our company as Number one  But it seems that the legal department got involved too so in large letters this big finger declares For internal use only eBook Update ------------My

section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to answer myself  These are all based on real e-mail  The names have been changed to make them funnier ---Dear Mr Adams When my local newspaper moved Dilbert to the business section it became three frames instead of four Was that your decision or the papers Ana Dear Anal Mr Adams creates over 100 frames for every daily strip thanks to the help of highly trained capuchin monkeys The newspapers receive the whole pile and throw away whatever frames they dont like Some keep one or two frames and a few who have no taste keep as many as three or four Mr Adams used to feel bad about his ratio until he learned that the creator of The Family Circus actually draws a full length animated motion picture every day -- using absolutely no monkeys -- and the newspapers only use one frame Thats gotta be frustrating Sincerely Dogbert Dilbert Fodder ---------------Whats bugging you about your job  Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter  The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves devious strategies frustrations of dealing with others conflicting objectives unintended management consequences and of

forward contracts we develop a time-continuous  pricing model for short-term electricity forwards The suggested  stochastic volatility model utilizes the non-tradeable spot  price of electricity and its variance rate as state variables  This enables us to capture the non-linearities and the high and  time varying volatility seen in electricity prices Using  maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filtering we  report empirical results on electricity data from the  Californian market  Keywords Electricity forwards stochastic volatility  time-continuous model equilibrium pricing Kalman

particular we examine interdealer trading its function as an  inventory management tool and its costs In addition we  develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy where some floor  traders who are more successful profit from their trades with  other dealers On average we find that dealers earn relative  profits when they execute position reducing trades However a  surprising finding is that more successful traders are more  likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades  which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer  hierarchy The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster  and Manns 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory  control and Reiss and Werners 1998 article on interdealer  trading The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits  from the elaborate futures data and the highly competitive  nature of dealer trading on the floor  Keywords Microstructure JEL Classification G10 G20 Quadratic Volatility Smiles       BY

risk premium is negative  by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option  portfolios buy the option and hedge with stock Within a  stochastic volatility framework we demonstrate a correspondence  between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium  and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns Using a sample of  SP 500 index options we provide empirical tests that have the  following general results First the delta-hedged strategy  underperforms zero Second the documented underperformance is  less for options away from the money Third the  underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility  Fourth the volatility risk premium significantly affects  delta-hedged gains even after accounting for jump-fears Our  evidence is supportive of a negative

hedge funds offer  investors a superior risk-return trade-off We do so using a  continuous time version of Dybvigs 1988a 1988b payoff  distribution pricing model The evaluation model which does not  require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution  of the funds in question is applied to the monthly returns of  77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May  1990-April 2000 The results show that as a stand-alone  investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return  profile We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be  inefficient with the average efficiency loss amounting to 276  per annum for indices and 642 for individual funds Part of  the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified  away Funds of funds however are not the preferred vehicle for  this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their  double fee structure Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio  context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation  outcomes Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72  individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone  basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when  mixed with the SP 500 The best results are obtained when  10-20 of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds JEL Classification G1 G2 P A R T N E R S   in   P U B L I S H I N G Editor and

Kirkpatrick Eric Brent Richard Parsons Ben Albanis George Subject	RE DB Contact Names IrisAmitava I may have already said this but weve had so many e-mails and telephone calls flying back and forth that I wanted to make sure I at least got this much out to you  Clearly I would like you to set up the meeting with the RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology as much as theyll tell and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model may have  Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model extends to other countries  I know from a previous conversation with Lea Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American names but they suspect it might extend to other countries  Conversely I know they are working efforts within Moodys Risk Management Services to develop private and probably public firm models specific to regions  One they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe  Data as always was the issue  See if the quants have any perspective on their successplan in that area Lastly we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward pushing off this private model initiative and Im very confident well be able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either DB andor Experian data Cheers Scott ---------------------- Forwarded by Scott SalmonEUEnron on 19042001 2051

might develop its really not based on anything  We know 17 will work for pre-packaged programs  We also know there will be a great number of names with less than the full 17 I assume we would pursue another model internal or external to provide probably less accurate numbers but at least available for names with fewer inputs Mike From	Iris MackENRONenronXgate on 18042001 1502 CDT To	Mike

major data associated with these specific DUNS numbers I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields  I know RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work for less than 17  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs  They suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who developed the model Regards Iris -----Original Message-----From 	Mumford Mike Sent	Wednesday April 18 2001 120 PM To	Mack Iris Cc	Dhar Amitava Salmon Scott Kirkpatrick Eric Subject	RE DB Contact Names Iris Thanks After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further Specifically with respect to global counterparty names we have DUNS cross-references on about 70 of active names 13k out of 185k  We could greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major data associated with these specific DUNS numbers Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP but without resolution on which specific fields are most useful  We also get to test for completeness of data how many have all 17 fields how many have only 12 of which fields etc Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher buying info we dont know we need converse of buying only the 17 fields doesnt seem best answer  We would end up buying additional info

FLASH Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany20 Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first ph ysical supply contract with an industrial customer  The customer based in Stendal Germany operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta king gas from Enron for a contract of 93 MW of interruptible one-year base load In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co mpleted a gas supply transaction the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe nt player with EnBW at Steinitz to overcome capacity constraints expected in Q3 this year  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany Enron had to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German y in order to close the gas supply deal  Although we are happy that we ha ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac tual obligations it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany the neg otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France commented Carsten H aack who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil Ulrich Finke a nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team  Another important el ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran sportation contract for VNG Germanys largest German import company after  Ruhrgas This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals  especially in East Germany  said Haack But more importantly this deal  will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo mers it can deliver on its promises and of equal importance that network  operators had better take our transportation requests seriously he added ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd ETOL for signing a serie s of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wi lton International A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two milli on tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Ponts nylon plant s New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies and for the prov ision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance secu rity and emergency response Paul Gavens CEO of ETOL said Securing an exclusive long-term supply agr eement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achi evement for ETOL The new arrangements extend the terms of our current cont ract for steam and power to 2010 restructure the pricing arrangements and  offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the  operation of their respective assets Enrons Northernmost Partner Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger  Kraft AS  Under the terms of the deal Enron Nordic Energy will assist Var anger in hedging its power sales power prices and area prices  The partne rship will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperat ure risk  In addition the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to  develop contacts with Varanger Krafts Russian partners and the Russian mar ket generally  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk this is the second such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationshi ps in Russia through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia  Varange r has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border  As  the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border Varanger works in coop eration with Russian partners to manage the water storage20 LEGAL STUFF The information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietar y to

GeneratorsPower Marketers December 19  FERC Post-Meeting Memo 20 Introduction 20 At the last Commission meeting of the year FERC approved  the first RTO in the Midwest and issued some critical orders on RTO development  announced plans to defer action and the effects of its November market power  orders  modified mitigation measures for the Western Systems Coordinating  Counci l reaffirmed price mitigation measures for the California ISO markets  an d challenged industry to develop a single industry consensus organization by  March 15 2002 to be the standards-setting body for commercial busines s and  communications protocol standards20 To that end  the Alliance of  Energy Suppliers and EEI encourages industry to actively participate in its  national meetings being held in four regio ns of the country to advance the  development of principles for which to fo rm this organization The  first of the four regional meetings will be held on January 15 2002 in  Phoenix AZ with the remaining meeting in Cincinna ti OH New  York City and Atlanta GA   An e-mail with all of the necess ary  logistical information has been circulated  If you are interested in  attending or sending a company representative and did not receive the earl ier  e-mail please let us know20 In addition FERC announced  a series of technical conferences on standard  market design and structure  market based rate market power and energy i nfrastructure20 20 If you would like copies of any orders please do not hesitate to  contact  us Midwest ISO Receives FERCs  Approval as an RTO20 In a series of inter-related RTO  decisions FERC approved the nations firs t RTO granting the Midwest ISOs  proposal to become an RTO while rejectin g a similar plan from the Alliance  Companies to form the Alliance RTO In  reversing prior policy FERC concluded  that the ARTO proposal lacked suffi cient scope and size to exist as a  stand-alone RTO and told the Alliance C ompanies to explore how their business  plan can be accommodated within the MISO structure Allowing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best solution that would compromise customers  interests FERC stated20 In related developments FERC also approved  International Transmission Com panys request to transfer operational control of  its transmission facilit ies to MISO and accepted an agreement between MISO and  International Trans mission that would allow the company to be an independent  transmission com pany that would share certain RTO functions with MISO Finally  in a relat ed docket FERC granted in part National Grids request for a  declaratory or der that it is not a market participant but dismissed the  Alliance Compan ies business plan without prejudice as unneeded given the other  Alliance o rder thus nullifying Grids proposal to manage ARTO More  detailed RTO su mmary provided below20 FERC Delays Implementation of New Market Power Rules 20 FERC announced that it would delay the effects of its November 20 market  p ower orders In FERCs December 19 order it recognized the Alliance of  En ergy Suppliers filing requesting FERC to vacate or stay the effects  of it s market power orders and initiate a rulemaking proceeding to allow for  co mments by affected industry participants as basis for its change in policy action We should claim this as a victory--for FERC has announced an upco ming  technical conference to discuss said orders and allow industry to voi ce its  concerns over the implications of such measures on the competitive  wholesale  markets Although a date for this technical conference has not b een announced  Chairman Wood said that details of the conference will be r eleased in a  notational order FERC has also delayed implementation of cer tain aspects of the  new Supply Margin Assessment SMA market power screen test 20 FERC Sets Schedule for Electric Market Design  Industry Told to Select Who lesale Market Standards Body or FERC Will Do  So20 FERC outlined a schedule for a rulemaking in the  Electric Market Design do cket and announced the release of a staff white paper  to serve as a strawm an piece for continued collaboration with interested parties  on standardiz ed electric market design FERC stated it expected to host industry  worksh ops in early 2002 tentatively set for January 22 -25 and February 4- 8  t o further develop ideas on market standardization and issue a NOPR in March 2002 The NOPR would be followed by additional workshops in April and May to  discuss NOPR inclusions and workshop developments Written comments on the NOPR  and workshop progress will also be due in May A final rule is e xpected to be  issued in July 2002 Although FERC staff recognized that thi s was a very  ambitious schedule the FERC presenter said they wanted to g et done before  summer break 200220 Meanwhile FERC said interested parties should  evaluate NAESB NERC and a lternative proposals for an organization to develop  wholesale electric ind ustry business practice and communication standards and  agree on a single consensus industry-wide organization to develop these  standards by March 15 2002 The Order indicated that should industry not agree  on a single  organization by that date FERC would either choose an organization  or ins titute a proceeding to develop the necessary standards 20 Commissioner Brownell reiterated her dismay and disbelief with  industrys  lag in progress lets get this done  I cant believe were  still  debating the who The other three Commissioners indicated their general   support for the Order Commissioner Breathitt believes that this ANOPR proc ess  is working well because it gives industry something to coalesce aroun d  Breathitt was also in favor of industry answering the question of how  much  standardization do we need and how much do we need to leave to creati vity and  innovation  Chairman Wood concluded his remarks saying the  GIGA-NOPR  is on its way20 The staff white paper covering these issues is available  from the FERC web site at httpwwwfercgovelectricrtomrkt-strct-commentsmrkt-strct-co nceptPDF   20 FERC Largely Reaffirms Prior Western  Market Price Mitigation Orders Modif ies Price Cap to Account for NW Winter  Peaking Concerns20 In a broad rehearing order that addresses a  wide range of issues related t o California and the western energy markets FERC  generally denied reheari ng requests and reaffirmed earlier decisions on pricing  and price mitigati on measures The order addresses rehearing and clarification  requests for  the Commissions August 23 November 1 December 8 and December 15  2000 o rders along with its March 9 June 19 and July 25 2001 refund and price   mitigation orders Among adjustments made to previous orders FERC modified the  scope of price mitigation and must-offer requirements especially as  applied to  governmental sellers and cooperatives eliminated the undersche duling penalty  established in the December 15 Order and provided an oppor tunity for certain  entities to submit evidence that the refund methodology results in a revenue  shortfall FERC also modified and provided clarifica tions on setting of the  mitigated market-clearing price20 In particular FERC clarified that 20 government sellers and cooperatives are excluded from price mitigation as   its applies to bilateral transactions outside the ISO spot market and also  with the must-run requirement outside of California20 units operating outside of California may set the mitigated  market-clearin g price20 the mitigated market-clearing price is to be set by the proxy price of the  last unit dispatched rather than the lower of the proxy price or the actu al  bid of the marginal unit20 and generators subject to the must-offer requirement should be able to  rec over their costs for complying with the ISOs instructions to keep their  u nits at minimum load status and that the ISO must pay these costs  regard less of whether the ISO buys the power20 Modification to Western-Wide Price Mitigation  Measures20 In a separate order FERC responded to industry  recommendation from its Oc tober 29 technical conference and modified the price  mitigation methodolog y for spot market transactions for the west-wide market for  the winter sea son FERC stated that changes would support continued price  stability and  balance in the western markets The changes were called for in  part FERC  said since the area the California ISO serves is a summer peaking  system  and a large portion of the 11-state Western Systems Coordinating Council   consists of winter peaking systems The changes extend from the date of the order through April 30 2002 at which time the summer mitigation measure s will  be reinstated Most notably the new cap levels take into account f luctuation in  natural gas prices20 Modifications to previous mitigation measures  are raises cap level from 98 to 108 continues to apply 10 percent credit worthiness adder sets February 2002 as date that final outstanding payments be made to  West ern sellers of power FERCs objective through these order was to allow  FERC and affected partie s in the West to move forward on calculating  any refunds owed and to provi de greater rate certainty and stability to the  market according to the co mmissioners20 More information on the  California and western market changes is available in FERCs press release  httpwwwfercgovnewspressreleasescalif1-de c192001PDF   and the full order httpwwwfercgovelectricbulkpowerel 00-95-001-12-19-01PDF    both available in pdf format from FERCs websi te 20 RTO Developments 20 MISO Approved As Nations First RTO 20 In approving MISOs RTO application as the nations first RTO FERC  said tha t it complies with the vision and requirements of Order No 2000 in  parti cular the requirement that an RTO be of sufficient scope FERC cited  favor ably MISOs announced merger with the Southwest Power Pool and said that it  was particularly encouraged by MISOs planned accommodation of flexible bu siness  plans and innovation as well as its considerable geographic span 20 For the most part FERC found that MISO satisfied the four characteristics  for an RTO independence scope and configuration operational authority a nd  short-term reliability as well as key functions FERC did however di rect MISO  to submit a number of revisions FERC found MISOs independence  satisfactory in  most respects but said that transmission owners cannot be permitted to have  veto privileges on filings that affect pricing FERC co nditioned MISOs RTO  status on modification of the MISO Agreement to give  it the authority to propose  rates terms and conditions of transmission se rvice under the MISO tariff On  the scope and regional configuration chara cteristic FERC told MISO to present  recommendations within 60 days addres sing the question of its eastern seam prior  to the integration of the Alli ance Companies into MISO FERC also indicated that  MISO should participate in its recently announced rulemaking proceeding to  standardize market des ign rules However FERC said MISO should also address  certain congestion management issues prior to implementation of standardized  market rules F ERC also directed additional changes to ensure the independence  of the mar ket monitor and required modification of the planning framework to  reflect that it will consider all market perspectives and to accommodate  third-pa rty investment construction and ownership of transmission  facilities 20 Alliance Companies Told to Work Under MISO FERC Finds  IRCA Efforts Insuff icient20 Citing in part strong support from a majority of the Midwest state  regulat ors for a single Midwest RTO and Alliance RTO ARTOs failure to achieve  t he necessary close coordination with MISO FERC concluded that the ARTO lac ked  sufficient scope to exist as a stand-alone RTO FERC expressed confide nce  however that the Alliance Companies desire to be a viable for-prof it  transmission business can be accommodated under the MISO Appendix I str ucture  FERC emphasized the importance of fostering RTO development design ed to provide  a seamless and robust market for millions of customers Allo wing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best solution that would co mpromise customers  interests concluded FERC The Commission ordered the  Alliance Companies to file  a status report on their efforts to join MISO w ithin 60 days In the Order FERC  acknowledged the significant time and ex pense incurred by the Alliance Companies  to date adding that it would con sider proposals for recovery of all prudently  incurred costs20 20 International Transmission Approved As ITC Under  MISO In a related order FERC said that International Transmission Company  Int ernational Transmission a subsidiary of DTE Energy could join the new RT O  as an independent transmission company that will be able to pursue innov ative  business strategies International Transmission proposes to maintain and develop  transmission while turning over to the RTO such functions as  congestion  management and curtailments tariff administration and securit y coordination  DTE Energy has indicated its intention to sell Internation al Transmission to a  third party FERC gave preliminarily approval for the divestiture of the  transmission facilities FERC however deferred rulin g on several contested  RTOtransco function issues until International Tra nsmission becomes truly  independent 20 National Grid Meets Independence Criterion as FERC  Dismisses Alliance Com panies ARTO Business Plan FERC granted in part and deferred in part a National Grid proposal to  mana ge the RTO transmission system FERC found that National Grid is not a  mar ket participant by virtue of its retail obligations in New York and New  En gland FERC directed the Alliance Companies to explore how their business   plan including National Grids proposal could be accommodated within the  MISO  RTO FERC expressed its intent to provide more guidance on this matte r in future  proceedings 20 General Discussion Signaling a deference to Midwestern state commissions Chairman Wood said  we have brought order out of an array of various and sundry efforts in  the  middle of the country    Its a good Christmas gift to the nation  Wood  cautioned that the orders findings are based on what best serves the  public  interest in the Midwest and that FERCs actions should not be const rued to  prejudge other types of RTOs in other parts of the country includ ing a  structure in which a for-profit transmission company could be an umb rella RTO  For her part Commissioner Breathitt dissented on the Alliance  Order stating  that after the Alliance Companies have already spent over  75 million in  start-up costs and its plans were given tentative approval b y FERC over the past  two and a half years she saw no reason to abruptly c hange direction and deny  Alliance Companies an opportunity to implement th eir business model The  Commission has not done all it could or should do  to allow Alliance to develop  Breathitt said  Addressing the near-unanimo us support among Midwest  regulators for a single Midwest RTO Commissioner Massey stated we are heeding  that advice and moving forward accordingly For his part the Alliance Order did  not represent a change of position  he said noting that he has long favored  forcing a consolidation of the tw o RTO proposals Additional details on these  orders can be found in the FE RC press release which is available from FERCs  website at httpwwwferc govnewspressreleasesmwestxpressrelPDF   20 20 PJM - PJM West Denied on a Procedural  Basis20 Chairman Wood in meeting discussion stated that the  rejection was on a pr ocedural issue only with a delay required only because of  provisions pend ing in other dockets In a two-page letter order FERC rejected  the reques t of PJM and PJM West to integrate but Chairman Wood assured the  parties  that FERC remained committed to the expansion effort and wants to see it  m ove forward very quickly All indications are that once the other provision s  have been addressed FERC would be ready to move forward on the PJM West effort 20 FERC Directs PJM To amend Tariffs to Include New  Oversight Measures20 FERC terminated its investigation into allegations that PECO Energy Company had operated its transmission system in a manner that illegally advantage d a  corporate affiliate FERC staff indicated that the record in the proce eding did  not establish a violation of the Federal Power Act or FERCs Sta ndards of  Conduct sufficient to warrant further enforcement proceedings an d that further  investigations into the matter were not warranted or necess ary Simultaneously  FERC accepted a report from PJM outlining a series of improvements to its  current procedures for reporting of transmission outa ges and the rating of  transmission facilities FERC directed PJM to file a mendments to its tariffs to  reflect the new procedures Commenting on the  swift resolution of the matter  Chairman Wood noted the importance of lift ing the cloud of an investigation  promptly when the evidence warrants it 20 Staff  Reports High Cost of Congestion Need RTO Congestion Management Mor e  Investment20 A presentation of a FERC staff report on electric  transmission constraints detailed the high costs of congestion and suggested  that building more tr ansmission would likely lower overall consumer costs The  report which FE RC staff acknowledged suffered from certain data limitations  found that b ottlenecks in the transmission system cost consumers more than 1  billion  over the past two summers The report also demonstrates the need for  stron g congestion management systems at RTOs FERC staff said FERC  commissione rs commended staff on the presentation and seemed supportive of the  conclu sion that building additional infrastructure would bring benefits to  energ y consumers FERC staff also noted that a parallel DOE National Grid Study  should be completed and released before the end of the year20 The staff  presentation is available in MS PowerPoint on the FERC Discussi on Papers page  at httpwwwfercgovcalendarcommissionmeetingsDiscus sionpapershtm   20 Additional Commission  Action20 FERC Issues Accounting NOPR  with Question to Industry20 FERC issued an accounting NOPR  Docket No RM02-3 seeking comment on whet her to require unregulated energy  marketers and traders to disclose holdin gs in derivative financial contracts  used to limit risks of volatile price swings in energy purchases and sales  Chairman Wood said he looks to indu stry to answer the question and tell FERC  that the current exemption and b lanket waivers and authorizations should remain  or not Commissioner Breat hitt pointed out that the current entities that must  comply with reporting requirements of derivative activity are not major players  in the derivati ve markets but the open-ended question if answered in the  affirmative w ould place burdensome requirements on a sector of the market ie  power ma rketers that most delve in that arena Chairman Wood said that he might  b e in agreement with possible responses from industry that say that maybe t hese  processes are for another agency to do eg SEC CFTC etc 20 Separately the NOPR proposes changes to the Uniform System of Accounts  U SA to record transactions required under Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard  FASB Statement 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and E quity  Securities FASB Statement 130 Reporting Comprehensive Income and  Statement  133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitie s The NOPR also  proposes changes in the annual reports to the Commission including the Form 1  to conform to recent actions by FASB to tighten dis closure rules The proposal  follows up Commission guidance issued in Augus t 2001 for using the existing USA  for recording transactions covered by th ese FASB Statements20 All four  commissioners endorsed the NOPR Chairman Wood said the new rules would focus  more on providing transparency to investors than broadening F ERCs regulatory  authority Commissioner Breathitt commented that the new  rule would seek to  collect annual data not give FERC the ability to acti vely monitor the  complicated transactions We would be obtaining a yearl y snapshot of derivative  positions Breathitt said I think this is a go od step 20 FERC Staff Provides Update on Development  of Standardized Interconnection  Policy20 FERC staff reviewed  the process and progress of the collaborative efforts  to develop a standardized  generation interconnection policy While interco nnection documents were filed on  December 14th as required by the ANOPR p articipants noted that the documents  remain a work in progress Participan ts had requested and FERC granted on  December 14 an extension of time to file the consensus documents to January 11  and to January 25 to file fina l comments in the docket The collaborative  process remains on schedule to take up the money side of the issue in April  200220 Technical Conference On Energy  Infrastructure in the Northeast20 FERC  will hold a conference in Energy Infrastructure issues in the Northea stern

his employees about an urgent problem with one of the main computers  He dialed the employees home phone number and was greeted with a childs whispering Hello Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster the boss asked Is your daddy home Yes whispered the small voice May I talk with him the man asked To the surprise of the boss the small voice whispered No Wanting to talk with an adult the boss asked Is your mommy there Yes came the answer May I talk with her Again the small voice whispered No Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left at home alone the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child  Is there any one there besides you the boss asked the child Yes whispered the child a policeman Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employees home the boss asked May I speak with the policeman No hes busy whispered the child Busy doing what asked the boss Talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman came the whispered answer Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the earpiece on the phone the boss asked What is that noise A hello-copper answered the whispering voice What is going on there asked the boss now alarmed In an awed whispering voice the child answered The search team just landed the hello-copper Alarmed concerned and more than just a little frustrated the boss asked What are they searching for Still whispering the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle Me Never Ask Your Child a Question Too Many Times Have you ever asked your child a question too many times  Here is an account from one woman My three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training and I was on him constantly One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands It was very busy with a full dining room While enjoying my taco I smelled something funny so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter who was clean Then I realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while so I asked and he said No I kept thinking Oh Lord that child has had an accident and I dont have any clothes with me  Then I said Matt are you sure you did not have an accident No he replied I just knew that he must have had because the smell was getting worse  So I asked one more time Matt did you have an accident This time he jumped up yanked down his pants bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled See Mom ITS JUST BOTTOM BURPS  While 100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened  I of course was mortified Some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked me for the best laugh theyd ever had And one particular four-year old prayed And forgive us our trash baskets as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets A little boy was overheard praying  Lord if you cant make me a better boy dont worry about it  Im having a real good time like I am Fun in Church From James Dobson  One Sunday a young boy was acting up during the morning worship hour  The parents did their best to maintain some sense of order in the pew but were losing the battle  Finally the father swung the little fellow up on his shoulder and walked sternly up the aisle on his way out to deliver some thoroughly deserved discipline  As they exited the church auditorium the little one lifted his head and called to the congregation Yall pray for me A Sunday school teacher asked her little children as they were on the way to church service And why is it necessary to be quiet in church One bright little girl replied Because people are sleeping The preacher moved briskly about the platform as he preached emphatically Because he was wired for sound with a lapel microphone he jerked the mike cord as he went  When he moved to one side he got wound up in the cord and nearly tripped before jerking free  After several circles and jerks a little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother and whispered If he gets loose will he hurt us Six-year old Angie and her four-year old brother Joel were sitting together in church  Joel giggled sang and talked out loud  Finally his big sister had had enough Youre not supposed to talk out loud in church Why  Whos going to stop me Joel asked Angie pointed to the back of the church and said See those two men standing by the door  Theyre hushers After the church service a little boy told the pastor When I grow up Im going to give you some money Well thank you the pastor replied  But why Because my daddy says youre one of the poorest preachers weve ever had A father was at the beach with his children when the four-year-old son ran up to him grabbed his hand and led him to the shore where a seagull lay dead in the sand  Daddy what happened to him the son asked He died and went to Heaven the dad replied The boy thought a moment and then said Did God throw him back down

Plenty of heat and humidity is in the air for the  East  The tropical wave in the Caribbean near Hispaniola does not look  as organized as it did yesterday This will result in a delay of naming it  a storm with the distinct possibility it never develops Most of the models do bring a system into the Southern Gulf by Thursday but interaction with Cuba tomorrow may keep it very weak Steering currents favor this moving t owards Mexico by Sunday The rest of the tropics remain eerily quiet  Ther e is plenty of weather news for the continental US in the short term and  it centers around the Plains heat ridge It is flexing NE once again with t he rest of this week looking quite hot from the Plains to the Ohio Valley  La te in the week the Great Lakes and NE get in on this for a day or two but there is still a weakening Canadian influence on those areas Another  front should drop from the Lakes towards the Mid-Atlantic Thursday and Frid ay The NW flow does not look particularly impressive so the cooling looks moderate at best We still look to be absent of widespread 100 degree heat outside the Plains but plenty of 90s and humidity will bring 100 aftern oon heat indices There is still very little of note going on in the Wester n US The hydro situation in the NW remains but temperatures in most of t he region are at or slightly below seasonal norms   Tomorrow Wednesday A ugust  1

6-10 Discussion  All of the models point to a ve ry warm period for the 6-10 day outlook and likely beyond The early stag es of my predicted warmer than normal August appear to be setting up as pla nned What seems to be in disagreement is where the hottest air sets up It has been the Plains primarily this summer The most recent runs of the Eur opean and Navy models suggest that the hottest air especially relative to n ormal shifts to the Lakes and NE as a monster of a ridge forms in the area The Canadian and MRF models look more like a flat broad ridge East of the  Rockies which keeps the heat core West of the Mississippi If any of these  verify close to reality most all of the Eastern 34 of the country will be above normal anyway but I like the large ridge idea the European seems o verdone The pattern continues to be favorable for t ropical activity but something out in the tropics has to get cranked up first The last couple  of years most tropical activity has been recurved NE away from the US du e to a trough in the Atlantic It currently is no where to be found but at the moment neither is the tropical activity  Day 6 Sunday August  5 2 001   Syncrasys Choice  Delta Temp

never be wrong Before excerpts from Leading the Revolution 	Want to build a great Internet portal site  Sorry its too late  If youre an incumbent like Sony or Bertelsmann and you want to grab a few million eyeballs online youre going to have to write a check to for a zillion dollars or so and give it to a twenty-something kid whos managing a company that is haemorrhaging cash  Or maybe youll get lucky and Yahoo will buy you 	Never has incumbency been worth less    The Internet has turned bricks and mortar into millstones  And venture capitalists pour millions of dollars into terrorist training camps for industry insurgents 	Consumers arent going to spend the rest of their lives wandering the soulless canyons of Wal-Mart to save a couple of bucks on a hammer    And all those big box retailers afloat in a sea of asphalt will one day find themselves out of the Internet-enabled revolution  With only one or two exceptions there is not a single market leader in the offline retailing world that leads its category online  Most of the old-line companies just didnt move quickly enough 	Go to any grocery retailer and ask to see its strategic plan from a few years back  Ill bet theres

aphorisms Bigger is better content is king own the customer cannibalize yourself--these are just a few of the cliches that trivialize complex business issues Another is the idea of first-mover advantage with its promise of extraordinary rewards for any company that is first to market with a new service or product At the height of dot-com mania first-mover advantage was a near-sacred mantra for VCs and entrepreneurs alike E-commerce zealots argued that early success would compound even more quickly on the Web than in the dawdling old economy Being first to build a consumer brand in a new category Amazon invent a new business model eBay or achieve critical mass what Webvan was hoping to do were seen as surefire routes to Midas-like profits In reality of course first-mover advantages proved illusory For most dot-com startups being first was simply a way to lose more faster  Many pundits began to argue that being a fast follower was a better strategy than trying to be the leader Old-economy CEOs eager to avoid the hard work of strategic innovation seized upon this diagnosis to justify their instinctive fear of novelty Suddenly timidity was heralded as a virtue But the fast-follower advocates had it wrong as well Most Internet companies failed not because they were first movers but because they were dumb movers What companies should learn from the Internet debacle is not that being first is a dangerous form of hubris but that being dumb seldom succeeds When it comes to trailblazing there are at least three ways to be a dumb mover--none of which is unique to Internet startups Dumb Getting your timing wrong   If a company invests faster than it learns it will over-drive the opportunity and end up with an expensive and embarrassing failure  Thats the fate that befell Apples pioneering handheld computer the Newton Was there a potential market out there for palm computers Sure  Could investment and marketing hype alone force the market to develop on Apples time frame No Companies that over-drive an emerging opportunity often under-drive it later on The initial performance gap a product of unrealistic expectations and over- investment produces a rapid retrenchment--and an opening for latecomers There is a market-penetration curve for every emerging opportunity  Typically this curve has an inflection point a moment when all the pieces of the business model finally fall into place customer demand explodes and the market takes off For videocassette recorders the curve began to slope gently upward with the launch of Matsushitas VHS format in the late 70s yet it would take another seven years for VCRs to find their way into one million American homes By contrast the market-penetration curve for Hotmail was a near vertical line with more than ten million users signing up in the first 18 months Matsushita ran a marathon Hotmail ran a sprint The Apple Newton might have evolved into something Palm-like but only if Apple had paced itself by spending less learning faster and iterating more quickly Apple blew the handheld opportunity not because it was the first mover but because it was a dumb mover Any management team that aspires to be a first mover must ask itself What race are we running sprint or marathon If you try to run a 100-yard sprint like a marathon youll be left behind If you try to run a marathon like a 100-yard sprint youll keel over from exhaustion  So it is critically important to ask some questions Are there difficult technical hurdles Does market takeoff depend on the development of complementary products or services Will a new infrastructure be required Will customers need to learn new skills or adopt new behaviors Are there high switching costs for customers Will competing standards confuse customers Are there powerful competitors that will seek to delay or derail us If the answer to any of those questions is yes a company must be careful not to pour in too many resources too soon the race is going to be a marathon On the other hand answer yes to all of these questions and youll need to sprint out of the starting block Are the customer benefits clear and substantial Are there potential network effects that will accelerate takeoff Are there powerful competitors that will be compelled to follow Staying on the optimal penetration curve--neither over-driving nor under-driving an opportunity--is a neat trick but its not impossible  AOL Sun Microsystems and Quicken-maker Intuit have all done it at one time or another Smart movers continually review their initial assumptions about the business model avoid the premium pricing and narrow market definition that create space for latecomers move quickly to collaborate with would-be competitors and outsource to maintain flexibility Dumber Overpaying for market share  The allure of capturing a first-mover advantage often produces a spending orgy among a gaggle of look-alike competitors each intent on ramping up faster than its rivals That is exactly what happened in many areas of e-commerce Services were given away free ad budgets were doubled and then tripled and massive investments were made in IT infrastructure--all in the quest of getting bigger faster In such cases its easy to overpay for market share To reap a first-mover advantage a company must buy market share at a discount That is it must be able to buy a big chunk of market share before its competitors figure out just how much that share will yield in future profits That is possible only if a company has a business idea that is truly original as did eBay and ICQ the Israeli company that invented instant messaging and was later acquired by AOL The fact is the Internet didnt produce too much in the way of authentic business-model innovation but rather too little And even when an original idea did surface it didnt stay original for long thanks to the incessant incestuous networking among Silicon Valleys venture capital companies The moral is simple If you want to profit from a first-mover advantage youd better make sure you start with a unique strategic insight that at least initially is unattractive to would-be competitors or protected by a wall of patents Dumb movers swarm smart movers dont Dumbest Being first with a business model thats DOA  Petscom Iridium Webvan Northpoint   Many business models are brain-dead from the get-go They breathe as long as they are hooked up to the ventilator of investor funds but expire the moment investors swallow their grief and pull the plug There are two fundamental flaws that can render a business model DOA a complete misreading of the customer does she really want to order dog food online and utterly unsound economics there will never be enough petroleum geologists and Arctic explorers to make satellite telephony pay Theres no advantage in being first if the destination aint worth the trip Not that this should be seen as an argument for always staying behind A stupid idea that fails is hardly an indictment of the notion of first-mover advantage Think twice before you let someone elses idiocy lull you into believing that being first is always a peril-strewn path  Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first in overnight package delivery or Andy Grove at Intel microprocessors or Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines discount air travel or Pete Kight at CheckFree online billing and payment or Jeff Skilling at Enron energy trading I dont believe any company should set out to be a follower fast or otherwise Sure in hindsight first movers often look dumb but it would be imprudent to bet that they will always screw up Indeed when you look beyond the lunacy of the Internet bubble and consider companies with high-quality management deep pockets and real competencies you find that being first pays off a surprisingly often So before you bet against the first mover youd be wise to ask yourself Am I sure the first mover is going to be a slow learner Will market penetration stay in single digits for some time to come giving me time to grab customers later on Will the rate of technology change remain high creating opportunities for a leapfrog strategy Will the first mover fail in signing up the most valuable partners If you can answer yes to all these questions then you may have the chance to be a successful second mover In the end the distinction between first mover and fast follower hides more than it reveals The goal after all is not to be first to market in some absolute sense but to be first to put together the precise combination of features value and sound business economics that unlocks a profitable new market Sometimes the company that does this is the first mover and sometimes it is not But its always the smart mover GARY HAMEL is chairman of Strategos a strategy consulting firm and author of Leading the Revolution FEEDBACK ghstrategoscom FORTUNEs Best Minds On E-Business Quote The management team must ask itself What race are we running sprint or marathon Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first  Or Andy Grove at Intel or Jeff Skilling at Enron

short-term electricity forwards The suggested  stochastic volatility model utilizes the non-tradeable spot  price of electricity and its variance rate as state variables  This enables us to capture the non-linearities and the high and  time varying volatility seen in electricity prices Using  maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filtering we  report empirical results on electricity data

examines the relationship of futures floor trader  proprietary positions to their market making activities In  particular we examine interdealer trading its function as an  inventory management tool and its costs In addition we  develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy where some floor  traders who are more successful profit from their trades with  other dealers On average we find that dealers earn relative  profits when they execute position reducing trades However a  surprising finding is that more successful traders are more  likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades  which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer  hierarchy The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster  and Manns 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory  control and Reiss and Werners 1998 article on interdealer  trading The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits  from the elaborate futures data and the highly competitive  nature of dealer trading on

The paper assumes that the implied volatility of options with  some given expiration is a quadratic function of the moneyness  The coefficients of this quadratic function the smile are time  dependent and stochastic The paper derives exposure parameters  of the price of the option to the local change in each of the  smile coefficients and an approximate formula for their risk  adjusted expected value These are important in managing the  exposure of the price of an option portfolio to changes in the  smile coefficients An Application of Malliavin Calculus to Continuous Time Asian  Options

ABSTRACT  Traditional methods for the computation of the Greeks with Monte  Carlo simulations converge very slowly for strongly  discontinuous payoff options As a solution Fournie et al  1999 and

USA ABSTRACT  We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative  by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option  portfolios buy the option and hedge with stock Within a  stochastic volatility framework we demonstrate a correspondence  between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium  and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns Using a sample of  SP 500 index options we provide empirical tests that have the  following general results First the delta-hedged strategy  underperforms zero Second the documented underperformance is  less for options away from the money Third the  underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility  Fourth the volatility risk premium significantly affects  delta-hedged gains even after accounting for jump-fears

this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer  investors a superior risk-return trade-off We do so using a  continuous time version of Dybvigs 1988a 1988b payoff  distribution pricing model The evaluation model which does not  require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution  of the funds in question is applied to the monthly returns of  77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May  1990-April 2000 The results show that as a stand-alone  investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return  profile We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be  inefficient with the average efficiency loss amounting to 276  per annum for indices and 642 for individual funds Part of  the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified  away Funds of funds however are not the preferred vehicle for  this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their  double fee structure Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio  context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation  outcomes Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72  individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone  basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when  mixed with the SP 500 The best results are obtained when  10-20 of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds JEL Classification G1 G2 P A R T N E R S   in   P U B L

PEAKED WE ARE CROSSING THE MOUNTAINTOP AND NOW EXPECT A DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT June is the first month that we have seen negative year-on-year comparisons in the commodity drivers that underlie earnings  Based on work in our last Power Curve report Power Curve 5 53101 we had not expected the commodity drivers of earnings to turn negative until 1Q02  Instead we see commodity comparisons turning negative in June and on a full quarterly basis 3Q01 June 2001  June 2000      Change Power Prices MWh                     5021      8325       40 Spark Spread MWh                     2377      5693       58 In our view the most important measure for earnings particularly for Power Producers is the Spark Spread which shows the gross margin potential for power generation in the spot market  Hedging trading and the sale of other services such as capacity availability and spinning reserves offsets the impact of a decline in this number  Most companies with generating capacity are at least 85 hedged for 2001 60 hedged for 2002 and 40 hedged for 2003 NEGATIVE QUARTERLY COMMODITY DRIVERS BEGINNING 3Q01 TWO QUARTERS AHEAD OF EARLIER EXPECTATIONS Forward power and gas markets suggest that 3Q01 will be the first full quarter of negative commodity comparisons  Earlier in PC5 we had expected this would not occur until 1Q02  What has surprised us is the swiftness and breadth of the decline in the power pricing environment  Unlike 2Q01 which had two good months -- April and May -- to buoy earnings forward markets suggest yearyear declines in power prices and the spark spread for all of 3Q01 and continuing into 4Q01  June is an important swing month in what is normally a relatively volatile earnings quarter  So far because of lower realized prices and a declining power price outlook a number of companies have either pre-announced or guided to reduced earnings expectations including  PPL PNW PNM NRG KSE and CEG Quarterly Comparisons Power Prices and Spark Spreads DOWNGRADING STOCKS DECLINING POWER PRICES ARE NOT GOOD FOR EARNINGS In a declining power pricing environment investors should take a more cautious stance on companies who are long the commodity -- ie companies who because of their business model are making a long bet on commodity prices Within this constraint we look for signs that mitigate this exposure Furthermore we are positive on the long-run case for aggressive companies who are building newer more efficient power plants and replacing the aging plant that has built up under 70 years of regulation  As long-run bets companies such as Calpine CPN downgraded to 2H from 1H offer an excellent play on deregulation although we temper our outlook due to declining power prices Certain other Power Producers are better positioned than others and when we add the valuation component to this discussion the stock prices of many Producers peaked in late Aprilearly May we think a number still offer attractive value However our broad thrust is to recommend companies who are not long power or have small exposure whether because of strong trading and risk management skills or a lack of generating capacity  In Power Curve 4 5101 when we first wrote about the declining price curve we suggested a more cautious stance towards Power Producers versus Energy Merchants  We stand by that advice  We are downgrading the rating on only 1 Merchant vs 4 Producers and Integrated Utilities who are exposed to power prices  In terms of estimates only 2 Merchants are being reduced while we are reducing 14 Power Producers and Integrated Utilities  Our top 3 growth-oriented picks for investors who want to avoid the impact of declining power prices are Energy Merchants ENE DYN and ILA  For dividend or total-return investors we recommend Integrated Utilities EXC ETR and AEP MACRO VIEW  WHY ARE POWER PRICES DECLINING Figure 1  The Forward Power Curve MWh --US 1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F MWh    3622    4053    6761    7344    4172    3681 The forward curve for power shows a rapid decline from peak levels achieved in 2000 and 2001E  Rapid growth in construction of new generating capacity is the primary cause of the decline in forward price expectations with the slowing economy an additional factor in the near-term  See Figure 2  Additionally we cite two reasons why plant builds tend to over-shoot either on the upside or the downside changes in the demand for power  These are because electricity is capital intensive and a commodity each of which creates cycles of over- and under-development 1 Incremental Capacity Exceeds Incremental Demand  The cause of the current decline in prices is the rapid addition of new generating capacity in all regions of the country  Additions to capacity are exceeding increases in demand for power by a wide margin in most regions  This has caused the supply and demand balance to shift from a shortage to a growing surplus Additional factors have hastened the decline in prices  A slowing economy has reduced demand as has the absence of last years hotter-than-normal weather So far this summer weather has been approximately normal 2 Capacity additions exceeded incremental demand in 2000  We think 2000 was the first year when incremental capacity exceeded incremental demand  We still have an underlying power shortage which has lasted well into 2001  However the market is adding capacity in a manner which should relentlessly lessen its severity and even potentially create over-capacity within the next several years In 2000 27000 megawatts MW of capacity was added up from 11000 in 1999 and less than 10000 MW during most of the 1990s  We expect approximately 45000 MW of capacity will be added in 2001 and a similar number in 2002  Since this amount exceeds the amount required to meet growth in demand we project a rising reserve margin  The reserve margin is the best fundamental indicator of the balance between supply and demand with a high reserve margin indicating over-capacity falling power prices and a low reserve margin indicating under-capacity rising power prices  We tentatively project a bottoming of the electricity commodity price cycle in 2003 if enough developers scale back their plans to build new plants Figure 2 US Capacity Additions and Reserve Margin 1996  1997  1998   1999  2000P  2001E  2002E  2003E MW Additions

have reached the peak of the first-ever cycle in the history of the industry  We put first in quotes because we think the cycles were always there except they were hidden by regulation  With deregulation of the wholesale power market in 1996 market-clearing prices reveal the balance between supply and demand  From 1996 until mid 2001 we were climbing the mountaintop of the electricity cycle  Now we are on the downside 2 Electricity production is capital-intensive  We think the cycles will last a number of years 4-6 years in the current cycle we put the first year as 1998 when enough liquidity existed in the newly deregulated market we see the bottom as 2003 driven by the capital-intensive nature of the industry  Power plants take a long time to build  Planning decisions must be made between 1 and 5 years in advance of the actual day when power will be produced  This is a much slower process than the market and pricing expectations at the time of planning will have no doubt changed by the time plants are up-and-running  We think it is difficult for individual company executives to fully anticipate the development plans of their competitors and in the quest for market share the tendency is to build in a manner which is often too aggressive when viewed on an industry-wide basis years later GUIDE TO INVESTORS  INDUSTRY-LEVEL TRACK THE SPARK SPREAD   A primary metric for investors to track is the spark spread  The spark spread measures the difference between power prices revenues and natural gas prices cost  This is the critical metric for tracking earnings power of generating companies  The gross margin of Power Producers in the spot market will be determined by the spark spread and when these companies hedge they will have to hedge using the forward spark spread available at that time  Thus a declining spark spread affects the earnings power of all companies even those who are well hedged  Only if they could hedge 100 would their earnings be unaffected by declining prices  No company we are aware of has been able to hedge 100 of their output The forward spark spread actually suggests a worse commodity price environment in the 20023 period than existed in 19989 prior to the run-up in prices in 20001 Figure 3 The Forward Spark Spread -- US 1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F MWh    2136    2304    4128    4065    1415     928 GUIDE TO INVESTORS  COMPANY-LEVEL STOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM The following factors will help companies weather the storm from most to least importance Trading and risk management skills  A strong trading desk acts as the eyes and ears to the market often providing advance warning of changes in the commodity price outlook  Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a strong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their competitors  The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits from trading and risk management activities own little if any generating capacity and are characterized by a commodity price-neutral earnings model All of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help their overall activity  Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron ENE-1H  We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price environment  Other companies with strong tradingrisk management operations include Dynegy DYN-1H and Aquila ILA-1H  Duke Energy DUK-1H and Mirant MIR-1H also have strong operations  In terms of vulnerability to power prices we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions owing to the lack or near-lack of generating capacity owned Contractinghedging activity  The more aggressive a companys moves were to lock in power prices earlier this year the better positioned they are Nevertheless the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on earnings particularly in the long-run  We note that Calpine CPN-2H which we have downgraded to 2H from 1H has aggressively stepped up its hedging activity in recent weeks signing a 3000 MW deal with Shell a 1000 MW deal with Reliant Resources RRI-NR  This activity appears to coincide with the rapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months Offsetting short positions  This is a characteristic typical of electric utilities who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the short obligation to sell power to their customers  Utilities that are well-positioned in this regard include  EXC and AEP  Utilities that are most vulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an effort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play Power Producers  These include  AYE CEG and PPL  We are particularly concerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity or separately relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars to upgrade  These plants are often the marginal unit providing earnings in tight pricing environments but having significantly less value as prices decline Backlog of plant development  We also think that companies with significant plant development backlogs can muscle their way through a weakened commodity price environment  In particular we note CPN whose plants in operation grow as follows Figure 4 Calpine Earnings Metrics 2000-2003E 2000     2001     2002     2003       CAGR YE MW in operation     5883   11705   21266   30463        73  of portfolio hedged             85      71      61 EPS                     111    195    230    300        39 They have hedged aggressively their output from their plants so even though future plants have lower margins overall EPS growth can still be impressive Nevertheless we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN reflecting the impact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output  Our revised Outperform rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth over the 2000-2003 period SUMMARY OF RATINGSESTIMATESPRICE TARGET CHANGES REVISED VALUATION TABLE RISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance Some horses are already out of the barn  Power Producers and selected Energy Merchants those with exposure to power prices are down 26 since peaking on May 1  Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now reflected in the stocks  However we do not think all of the horses are out of the barn and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at this time  The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS estimates  We think this is likely particularly for 2002 and 2003 if power prices continue their decline  We think when this happens stocks are likely to go down further Hotter Weather  So far in 2001 weather across the country has been near-normal vs hotter-than-normal weather last year  The year-on-year moderation has affected the forward curve  Should August become hotter relative to last year the forward curve could temporarily strengthen boosting power price and earnings expectations near-term  Ultimately we think the principal cause of the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants  Even if the curve temporarily strengthens due to weather we still expect it will be downward sloping for the next several years A Rebound in the Economy  A weak economy has certainly affected power demand which in turn has affected the forward curve  When the economy eventually rebounds which some are predicting by 4Q01 or early 2002 the forward curve should strengthen  We will watch for these signs and adjust our outlook accordingly Cancellations of plant development plans  This factor is a wildcard for the group in our opinion  We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to cancel plant development plans  So far sources such as turbine manufacturer GE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled  Ifwhen they occur the cancellation of development plans will have two effects First it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment and would likely be perceived as negative  Then following the cancellation of enough development plans it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power prices in the future  This is why we think power prices will bottom in 2003 The mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will in part be driven by cancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter supply-demand balance SUMMARY  BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP We are lowering ratings price targets andor estimates on 11 companies with exposure to the declining trend in power prices  We advise investors to be more cautious on the group  However we continue to advise a shift toward Energy Merchants who have little or no commodity price exposure and away from Power Producers who are long power as well as those Integrated Utilities who are long power  Additionally we see several factors that also merit a cautious outlook apart from the declining trend in power prices and its adverse effect on earnings 1 Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market begins to recover andor tech stocks begin to outperform 2 Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a time when many other SP 500 sectors have rolled over  The resumption of earnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away from our Growth Energy names particularly if their earnings is now under challenge QUARTERLY ESTIMATES

DL-GA-allenronworldwide2 Subject Overview of Investor Conference Call Today Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview  of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot  of significant events that led to our current situation -- In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments -- Because of these bad investments weve become over-leveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging -- Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under stand financial and operating disclosures and -- On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our 8-K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses non-core businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include -- Natural gas pipeline businesses -- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe -- Retail businesses in North America and Europe and -- Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple  of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity  concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships Non-Core Businesses Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than 8 billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect  that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately 29 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit Rating10-Q Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that  our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows -- Moodys at Baa3       Under Review for Further Downgrade -- Fitch at BBB-             Evolving Status -- SP at BBB-              CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our 1 0-Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov  19 We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference  call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next  few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings 20 20 In

23rd meeting Bruce Williamson Tina Sivinski Tim Tipton Bruce Sukaly Bob Peebler Vince Kaminski Dean Arthur Warga Praveen Kumar and Lane Sloan  The handout material is attached for members that could not attend The committee viewed a TV ad  for the Bauer College and a TV news story on the new AIM center and  Cougar Fund  The first item of business was the Partnership program  The committee agreed on the following levels Trustee            100000 Partner                50000 Investor               25000 Sponsor              10 000 For this year  these levels would receive placements in the new Energy Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows Trustee up to 10 Partner up to 4 Investor up to 2 and Sponsor 0   All members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the Learning Community programs of seminars forums and symposiums free of charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying depending upon the partnership level  The Chairman noted that with the certificate classes beginning in September then the annual fee structure would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI  The original idea had been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach  The Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing efforts originally targeted at 200000 for this year Dr Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as 1 Risk Management 2 International Project Finance and 3 Energy Accounting The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy Accounting to start programs in September many already available  The International Project Finance may require additional time because of development efforts on certain courses  Dr Kumar requested that the members identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy community  We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on what level of participation your forsee for your company  Dr Kumar noted that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses until junior and senior years  He said that specialized training programs seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars forums and conferences There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not recommend pursuing conferences at this time  The plan would be to have in steady state 3 seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a featured speaker  It was noted that the venue would be an important consideration to attract appropriate audiences  Various suggestions were given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations should be practical and of high quality The committee agreed that a reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter  The thought was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service sector considerations Non members would not participate but selected student participation was seen as valuable A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various committee members  The idea of a symposium was to bring together important spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the Energy community The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts  Dr Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and credit risk considerations  The committee was quite enthused that an imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought out as to topic and the management of the process including the media  It was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then it would need to provide a project manager  Committee member companies would need to provide assistanceadvice particularly on coordinating the media Dr Kumar will be sending out an e-mail to get your input  Then Dean Warga would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks Next Dr Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with other aspects of GEMI the AIMs investment center etc The Chairman then discussed GEMIs overall marketing image  There was some fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image contained in the attachment  After the dialogue on the symposium which would be a major marketing effort in an of itself the discussion on external and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting  The chairman noted that there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium effort was pursued  The major focus initially being on the symposium then coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing over the next several months The last item was the competitive assessmentrelationship with other universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current approach and principles in the attachment  This received good support from the committee The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks  I will send out a separate e-mail on possible dates for you to consider Best Regards Lane - GEMIJanRppt

1017 to give me time to make progress in my class presentations so that students would have more of a background in listening to Vinces presentation  If select the 910 date I would ask Vince to take into account in the level of his presentation that by that date the students will only have had 6 hrs of the Foundations of Energy Finance class classes begin 829 and Labor Day intervenes  On the plus side the students do come in with three finance courses core course investments advanced corporate as prerequisites to my class In sum I appreciate the importance of recruiting and can accommodate Vinces presentation Sep 10th  Please advise if Vince would like the 2 12 hr 2 to 5 pm including breaks time slot or the 75-min subset thereof Perhaps we could arrange lunch or dinner the day of the presentation for yourself and our 5 summer associate interns  That way we are making the most of your time in Austin I had planned on hosting Vince for lunch with my faculty colleagues  If his presence is called for at a lunch scheduled by your AssociateAnalyst Program we will plan his schedule around that  By this e-mail I also inquire of Lexi whether Enron intends to host a reception at the 5 pm end of the class  If so she should contact Energy Finance Center Assist Director Angela Dorsey at AngelaDorseybusutexasedu or 512-232-7386 to coordinate matters Sincerely Ehud Ronn Ehud I Ronn Jack S Josey Professor in Energy Studies Department of Finance McCombs School of Business University of Texas at Austin Austin TX 78712-1179 Voice  512 471-5853 FAX   512 471-5073 Internet  eronnmailutexasedu

lenders is t he best approach to resolve the protracted dispute a spokesman for its In dian unit said This follows comments made by Enron chairman Kenneth Lay in Fridays issue of Financial Times that Enron is looking to exit from its I ndian venture The Dabhol Power Company 65 per cent owned by the Enron is locked in a bitter dispute with a local utility over a payments default  We want out said Enrons Chairman Kenneth Lay in an interview with the Fi nancial Times DPC which is Indias biggest direct foreign investment had  signed a contract to supply power to a state-owned utility the Maharashtra State Electricity Board from its gas-based plant on the states west coas t But MSEB stopped buying power in May calling it expensive and defaulted  on payments jeopardising the projects future20 We have made it pretty clear to the government leadership we are now at a  point where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners do Lay said in the Financial Times

STANDARD Monday July 30 2001 Centre to keep off Dabhol spat20 The Centre is unlikely to intervene directly in the Dabhol problem despite  Enrons willingness to sell its interest in the 2184 mw project to the gove rnment Power ministry sources said the government has made its intentions  very clear on this issue on several occasions that any direct intervention  by the Centre was highly unlikely as it would face severe opposition from o ther states There is absolutely no change in that stance at present sai d an official The Centre was inclined to play the role of facilitator only in arriving at a solution to the problem and the central governments rep resentative in the re-negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra gover nment had already been asked to expedite the proceedings he said Enron in a statement on Saturday said that as the largest shareholder in Dabhol Pow er Company DPC the company believed that selling its interest either to  the central government or to the projects lenders was the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute between DPC and the Maharashtra State Elect ricity Board MSEB It stressed that any sale would need to be on terms pr oviding a complete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures The  company pointed out that the Dabhol issue was clearly having an adverse eff ect on the confidence of potential foreign investors to India Pursuing a  buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a timely manner protecting  Indias investment climate and interests of DPCs stakeholders said the s tatement The company said that while DPC remained open to discussing other viable solutions it had serious concerns about getting embroiled in a ser ies of re-negotiations It pointed out that no realistic proposal was offer ed to the company as yet and no progress had been made in securing creditw orthy buyers that can purchase power at a price that was reasonable for new -generation plants The statement said that until the issue was resolved DP C intended to continue pursuing all other remedies under the PPA such as i nternational arbitration to resolve the issue in a way that protected the  rights of DPC sponsors lenders fuel suppliers and LNG ship owners20 Pressure tactic says lenders20 Lenders to DPC are unmoved by the companys demand that they take over the  project and dubbed it as a pressure tactic The company had said in a press release on Saturday that the best solution would be for the Union governme nt or the lenders to take over the project We need to run our banks and i nstitutions and not a power project said one senior banker involved in th e project The lenders however accept the fact there is a sense of urgency  and the government must get into the act faster At the London meeting last week DPC showed its willingness to run Phase II of the project on naphtha but MSEB is not willing to give its nod to commissioning of the Phase II 20

FINANCIAL EXPRESS Monday July 30 2001 MSEB FIs plan roping in Centre for picking Enron equity in DPC  Sanjay Jo g Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB and Indian financial institution s IFIs are planning to make a last ditch effort to rope in the BJP-led go vernment at the Centre for picking up the Enron equity in the Dabhol projec t through its undertaking as their funds amounting to over Rs 2500 crore i n addition to a guarantee of Rs 3900 crore to offshore lenders are involve d in the projectThe MSEB has contributed nearly Rs 800 crore to pick up 30 per cent equity in the Dabhol phase-I and the IFIs have collectively lent  Rs 1738 crore for both the phases plus a guarantee of Rs 3900 crore to of fshore lenders MSEB and IFIs sources told The Financial Express that the E nron chairman Kenneth Lays statement on Enrons desire to pull out of Dabh ol project has not come as a rude shock but as an expected one However t hese sources said that if Enron wants to be out of 2184 mw Dabhol project their exist should take place after tough negotiations with an active in volvement of the Union government They have projected various scenarios including the Enron General Electric and Bechtel collectively agreeing to recover about 50 to 60 per cent of th e total equity of 900 million in the Dabhol project from the Industrial De velopment Bank of India which is a rupee lender consortium leader The MSE B and IFIs are aware that the Enron and other equity holders will insist on the full capital recovery and that they will be quite keen on purchase of  their equity with interest at par by the new buyer However MSEB and IFIs sources are of the view that due to their hard barga ining in the presence of the Centre the Enron and other stakeholders may a rrive at certain compromise so that they can recover a substantial amount b locked in the project Secondly in view of cut in the equity the loan amo unting to over 12 billion could be restructured at the lower interest of  12 per cent and that the moratorium period should be increased Thirdly th e Centre will lend a financial support to its undertaking to pick up majori ty equity and take over the Dabhol project they feel According to MSEB an d IFIs in another scenario the state-run Gas Authority of India Ltd Gail  and Indian Oil Corporation IOC should be asked to take over the liquifi ed natural gas LNG project in a serious bid to cut the tariff The per un it tariff which has been average at Rs 880 may come down to Rs 220 to R s 240 per unit The Dabhol Power Company is believed to have spent nearly  Rs 2500 crore on the LNG project Moreover the MSEB which is at present doubtful over the fate of its equit y of Rs 800 crore may pick up 51 per cent equity and appeal to the Mumbai  based utilities Tata Power and BSES for taking up the balance equity in the Dabhol project The MSEB and IFIs are keen that the impending issue be res olved amicably especially to avoid the legal battle in India and arbitrati on in London A section of MSEB is confident that the power purchase agreem ent PPA on the issue of misdeclaration and default on the availability of power by DPC can be proved null and void and there will be no need for the payment of any compensation to DPC This will enable the take over of Dabh ol project by an Indian entity quite possible Lay seems using pressure tac tics Mr Lays statement on Enron pull out is being seen in the political ci rcle as a pressure tactic especially when the Supreme Court is hearing the DPCs petition on August 6

rate Bhujbal said after a function organised by ex-serviceme n Four states Madhya Pradesh Delhi Karnataka and Punjab had agreed to b uy power from Enrons troubled Dabhol Power Project at a tariff as low as R s 165 to Rs 260 per unit during a meeting Godbole Renegotiations Committe e had with prospective buyer states on July 26 here Replying to a query re garding the US giants desire to pull out of the power project in India he quipped jinko jaana hai wo jayenge unko koi rok nahi sakta those who  wish to leave will leave no one can stop them He however expressed hop e that the current Enron

TIMES OF INDIAMonday July 30 2001 Maharashtras offer unrealistic DPC20 US energy major Enrons Dabhol Power Company DPC on Friday said that pric e proposals made by four states to draw power from the Dabhol project were totally unrealistic even as Godbole renegotiations committee reported a  stalemate in the talks with DPC Referring to the offer of Karnataka Delhi  Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to buy power at a tariff as low as Rs 165 and  Rs 260 DPC said unfortunately these are totally unrealistic proposals  unattainable by new generation liquid plants including those set up by the public sector On the other hand after meeting DPC officials on Friday m orning Madhav Godbole told reporters that currently talks with DPC had rea ched a stalemate with interested states quoting lower prices than the US en ergy majors expectation After discussions with four states and receiving  communications from Haryana and Rajasthan he said that all these were read y to draw DPCs 1444 mw phase-II power at an average rate of Rs 2 to Rs 2 25 per unit An overall demand for DPC power is at around 800 mw to 1000  mw but not all of these is a base load one Moreover it is for more than  half a year mainly non-monsoon months of November to May Godbole said H e added that the states had informed the commission that each of them had a regulatory framework in the form of an electricity regulatory authority in place and was bound by a merit dispatch order which did not allow them to buy costly power like DPCs so long as cheaper tariff was available in t heir own state PTI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Saturday 28 July 2001 Demand for DPC power only at particular price20 20 THE Godbole panel today conveyed the power-offtake proposals of six States  to Dabhol Power Company DPC officials The company was told that there wa s combined demand for 800-1000 MW power at not more than Rs 250 per unit  One thing is abundantly clear There is demand for DPC power at a parti cular price If the price increases the demand may not be large Dr Godbol e told reporters  We have told Enron that the need for 800 to 1000 MW DP C power is not at baseload nor is it an all-year-round demand The States  will require this power only between the months of April to November and th e demand will fall during the rainy season he said20 Karnataka Punjab Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the pan el yesterday Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking for 300 and 100 MW each While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs 1 65 per unit other States have said they will not pay more than Rs 225 to  Rs 240 per unit According to Dr Godbole the company officials will tak e up the matter with lenders and collaborators before the next meeting wh ich is expected to be held in August Meanwhile according to DPC the powe r purchase proposals presented by various States are totally unrealistic  and unattainable by new generation liquid fuel plants including even those  in the public sector such as NTPCs Kayamkulam Dr Godbole had suggested  that DPC power at competitive rates could replace captive power in a nu mber of States He said though DPC had earlier agreed to reduce tariffs by  50 paise this would no longer be easy as the project has seen cost escalat ion after stoppage of phase II work  Our dialogue with Enron is bogged d own by two issues-- the plant load factor at which the unit is run and the  price of power Dr Godbole said He said there was a need to take a  se rious look at whether demand projections in the country are realistic20

ECONOMIC TIMES Monday July 30 2001 Maharashtra to pay Rs 788cr penalty to MSEB Girish Kuber20 20 MAHARASHTRA has decided to pay Rs 788 crore to the ailing Maharashtra State Electricity Board to compensate it for the damage it has caused the power  utility through tariff concessions to various sectors Padmasinh Patil the states energy minister had wanted to give tariff concessions to farmers which was objected to by MSEB Even the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission asked the states energy department to restrain its generosity The MERC had asked the government not to offer concessions at the cost of  its SEB and directed it to make a budgetary provision if it wanted to go ah ead with its plan Accordingly Mr Patil announced last year that the state government will compensate the board The MERC had set a deadline of Octob er 2001 for sanctioning the compensation The supplementary demand presente d to the state assembly makes this provision It has been decided to give  subsidy to MSEB to compensate the loss arising from supplying electricity a t concessional rate to agricultural and powerloom consumers with effect fro m May 1 2000 said the demand by the states finance ministry20 Currently concessions of 55 per cent and 3333 per cent in the electricity bills is given to powerloom and agricultural consumers The total expendit ure involved in the proposal is estimated to be around Rs 788 crore The is sue of offering concessions to powerloom and agriculture consumers has been hanging fire for the last couple of years The board last year had raised  the tariff for agriculture and powerloom consumers which was opposed by the state government for obvious reasons The government announced a roll-back of the tariff hike only to be prevented by the MERC from doing so The MSE B will now be charging Rs 600 per one horse power pump bringing down the r ate from Rs 1400 and Rs 185 per loom down from the earlier rate of Rs 300  The government has also decided to waive 55 per cent of the Rs 110 crore  unpaid dues from powerlooms Delayed payment charges for the defaulters has also been waived and they have been granted three instalments for clearing old dues According to MSEBs own admission more than 118 lakh of the tot al 130 lakh consumers are being supplied subsidised power20

this story in the clips -- it says the Front line show is airing tonight Ill dig up TVA for you Jeannie June 5 2001 117AM Houston Chronicle PBS pledge drive alters schedule  By MIKE McDANIEL  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle TV Editor  Paul Hope like many theater fans tuned to Channel 8 Sunday night in anticipation of the  first hour of the joint PBSCBS telecast of the 55th Annual Tony Awards  W hat he got instead was a travelog hosted by Rudy Maxa Because this is pled ge drive week Channel 8 did not air the first hour of the three-hour award show as it has in previous years  Channel 8 has made Houston a theatric al cowtown by this decision Hope a resident actor at the Alley said Mon day  Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd called the preempting absolutel y indefensible and shocking  Fortunately Channel 8 is being more flexibl e about a second program that it had originally decided not to air this wee k  Frontline which airs nationally at 9 pm tonight takes a hard look a t Californias energy problems and their direct connection to Houston The  telecast includes interviews with several Houston players including Enron s Kenneth Lay  KUHT station manager John Hesse said Channel 8 became aware of the Frontline story titled Blackout and its Houston connection last w eek Because of its local news value the show will be tape-delayed and air ed on KUHT at 10 tonight It will be repeated at 9 pm June 12 when Chann el 8 originally had planned to air the show  When we learned of the local significance we obviously wanted that program to air here in a timely m anner as in the rest of the country Hesse said  We are getting a little bit of heat for the Tony thing Hesse said The problem is its right i n the beginning of our pledge evening We had a schedule in place and a de cision was made to stick to that schedule because that was our opportunity  for fund raising  Fund drives are vital to keep the station operating and to purchase quality programming  When were scheduling our pledge dates we try to coordinate the normal PBS schedule with what we determine will d o the best for us in terms of fund raising Hesse said We only use about 2 percent of our air time a year in fund-raising efforts and when were u sing that 2 percent we have to make the most of them  Thats no comfort  to the folks who were hoping to experience what turned out to be theatrical history being made Mel Brooks The Producers -- not only the talk of Broa dway but also the entertainment world -- won a record 12 Tonys Sunday night   Most were awarded in the shows first hour -- where Tonys for director  choreographer and other categories are handed out To diehards the PBS por tion of the Tonys exceeds CBS in that it airs without commercials and incl udes behind-the-scenes interviews with directors composers designers and  others  Hesse explained that Channel 8s pledge-drive dates were set befor e the station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys  The first hour o f Sundays show had direct links to theater talents whose work has been see n and heralded in Houston  David Woolard nominated for best costume desig n for The Rocky Horror Show is costume designer of The Carpetbaggers Chil dren which opens Wednesday at the Alley  Doug Besterman a winner Sunday  for his orchestrations for The Producers has done the same for the Frank  Jekyll and Hyde Wildhorn productions that have played here  Doug Schmidt a nominee in the scenic design category for 42nd Street was a designer fo r the Alleys Civil War and A Christmas Carol  Hesse said We knew by the end of March that PBS would co-host Sundays show and yet the decision  was made to stick with the schedule in place  Because the Tonys isnt ow ned by PBS it could not be used as a pledge show although Hesse conceded pledges could have been sought before and after  Theres nothing against the rules  he said Its just been our normal method of operation her e to run the pledge drive at 7 pm in terms of our prime-time evening pl edge start  In a related development NBC affiliate KPRC will not be show ing the first episode of a new comedy series bowing tonight Kristin starr ing Kristin Chenoweth is being pre-empted by Road to Redemption a movie f unded by the Billy Graham Crusade  Channel 2 made a decision in March to r un the movie 7-830 tonight KPRC general manager Steve Wasserman said NBC has scheduled the premiere of Kristin for 730 pm and is not allowing it to air later in prime time he said 09

prediction of the stationary distributions of other market statis tics A test is proposed that allows a comparison of predicted and sample b id-ask spread distributions taking parameter estimation error into account The methodology is applied to the screen-based interbank foreign exchange  market using continuously recorded quotes on the DeutschemarkUS dollar ex change rate20 Keywords

increases following stock distributions changing bid--ask spreads and the true variability of the underlying value of the firm Employing data from the CRSP NASDAQ and  NMS files we find a relatively minor role for changing spreads Increases  in true variances are the major component of variance increases with change s in return autocorrelations playing an important role20 Keywords Stock

dealers who have monopoly  power to set prices bids and asks for a given asset but who face indirec t competition from other specialists who trade in related assets In the co ntext of a simple model where investors have mean-variance preferences we  characterize the equilibrium bids and asks quoted by K specialists in N ass ets where some specialists may control more than one asset We compare the equilibrium spreads as the number and factor structure of the assets eac h specialist controls is varied It is shown that for some constellations o f initial portfolio holdings and asset covariance it is socially preferred  to have competing specialists while for others it is socially preferred to have their actions coordinated or to have one specialist control several  assets In a simple factor model we show how the optimal specialist contr ol structure depends on whether the assets trade as substitutes or compleme nts In some situations it is beneficial to have specialist power concentra ted within industries in other situations across industries and in yet o ther situations not to be concentrated at all  1998 Elsevier Science BV  All rights reserved20 JEL Classification D43 G12

controlling for proxies of order flow characteri stics the study finds that screen-based traders are more sensitive to mark et volatility than floor-based traders in setting the bid-ask spread Sprea

traders and specialists in the market-ma king process We find that a large portion of posted bid--ask quotes origin ates from the limit-order book without direct participation by specialists and that competition between traders and specialists has a significant imp act on the bid--ask spread Specialists spreads are widest at the open na rrow until late morning and then level off The U-shaped intraday pattern  of spreads largely reflects the intraday variation in spreads established b y limit-order traders Lastly the intraday variation in limit-order spread s is significantly related to

that emphasizes dealers interactions as their inventories change an d predicts that the extent of outside competition limits the bid--ask sprea d and the number of dealers We hypothesize that the extent of outside mark et making capital in a stock is related to that stocks institutional holdi ngs Evidence shows that the extent of institutional holdings relative to t rading volume proxies for outside competition For stocks with little outsi de competition the spread is large even though the number of dealers is al so larger than for comparable stocks The component of the spread related t o outside market making capital is economically significant about 12  to 1 percent of price The composition of volume as to trade size and trad e frequency which is related to the level of institutional

Highlights ------------------------------------------------- New DNRC Word  Boss and Cow-orker quotes  Plop Version 20  True Tales of Induhviduals  My Holiday Message -------------------------------------------------DNRC Update -----------The 400000 members of DNRC continue to get smarter and better looking every day Case in point I am typing this newsletter using telekinesis while watching CNN in an adjoining room And if Im not mistaken Paula Zahn is trying to flirt with me New DNRC Word -------------A DNRC member suggests this new word for Osamas terrorist organization Al-Qae-duh I would love to have been a fly in Osamas beard last year when he was discussing his plan for global conquest Osama I have an idea Lets attack the most powerful nation in the history of the universe and then hide in caves Omar  All in favor say eye That might sound like a crazy plan to many of you but you need to realize that Osama grew up in Saudi Arabia where that sort of strategy has worked in the past In the November 12th issue of Newsweek theres a Special Advertising Section where Saudi Arabias public relations firm describes the wonderful history of Saudi Arabia In 1901 a guy named Ibn Saud along with his cousin and 38 buddies climbed over the fortress wall in Riyadh and waited until the Amir came strolling by Then Ibn and his cousin hacked the Amir to death with swords At this point in the story -- so you dont think Im making up this whole thing -- I quote from Saudi Arabias own PR article The Riyadh garrison demoralized by the death of their leader and fearing they faced a far larger force than 40 men surrendered Thats right Ibn conquered a whole city with 40 men of which 38 were just standing around watching Eventually the Saud family consolidated power named the country after themselves and formed a royal dynasty that is still in power Thats the inspirational story that little Osama learned in school when he was growing up Whos crazy now True Quotes from Induhviduals -----------------------------Here are more true quotes submitted by DNRC members Most of these are from managers As you will see Induhviduals are confused by anything involving critters or body parts Its an exercise in fertility Hindsight is 50-50 Just use your own excretion You are never going to fail unless you try Were scraping the bottom of the iceberg Today is like the day Rome was built in  We cant afford to have any fiddlers The project is going down the toilet in flames He might be barking at a red herring Youre treading on thin water I think he meant we should cross our Ts and dot our Is but it came out this way Be sure we all cross our eyes Hes as deaf as a bat We dont want to stick our necks out and get our asses chopped off I gave him a real mouthful I really took the bull by the hands He doesnt know his hole from an ass in the ground You should talk to her She is a minefield of information I cant remember but its right on the tip of my head You can lead a pig to pearls and then he trailed off Thanksgiving is early this year because the first Thursday fell on a Monday The skeleton is there You just have to sharpen it and put the decorations on the tree And this last quote which may or may not have come from Osama We need an escape goat Plop Version 20 -----------------In case you ever decide to start your own comic strip and you want to solicit opinions from other people let me give you this piece of valuable advice You should never -- and I mean NEVER -- give the comic a name that rhymes with any of the following words Flop Drop Stop That little rhyming opportunity was not lost on about two hundred of you who thought Plop was not up to DNRC quality Fortunately some people actually liked Plop I read every comment and the breakdown looks roughly like this Loved it   33 Liked it   46 thought it has potential Loathed it 21 Thats a great response for a first draft of a comic Comic strips normally get developed for several months before the public sees them Youre in on the ground floor Version 20 of Plop incorporates many of your comments I renamed Plop because Plop was the name of a comic book in the past I changed Smokeys species I made Plop more optimistic I addressed the hip-deep mud question and I started to fill out the personalities of the main characters Only a few people were bothered by the physical similarity to the Taliban so Im not going to let that bother me if the comic develops into something worthwhile The new and improved strips are posted on the Web at httpwwwunitedmediacomcomicsplop and begin with 21 All comments and rhyming insults are appreciated Induhvidual Baby Names ----------------------Here is further proof that all Induhviduals should be given the same name to keep things simple --A doctor friend of mine was on hand for a delivery in a maternity unit  The mother named her daughter Placenta --I once knew a person with the tuneful name of Listerine --My wife was a public social worker in South Carolina many years ago One of her case families had a daughter named Syphilis  The family pronounced it in two parts Syph-Philis  One day my wife asked the mother how they came to name the child Syph Philis  The mother said the hospital named her and she got a copy of the birth certificate to prove it On the birth certificate was an annotation that the child was born of a mother with syphilis The mother assumed the hospital had named her child for her Editors note That one sounds like an urban legend to me Let me know if youve heard it before Saving the World ----------------Heres a fun mental exercise Try to think of any problem in the world that wouldnt be reduced if we all did some extra shopping this year How about terrorism Lets see if we shop a little extra that stimulates the economy which increases tax collections which pays for more security Ta-dah How about unemployment Shopping -- stimulated economy -- more hiring How about diseases Shopping -- stimulated economy -- funding for research So I dont think Im exaggerating when I say that buying Dilbert merchandise will solve every problem in the world

were worth mentioning --As I entered the restroom a cow-orker who had just finished his business turned to me and said Oh hey Brent I was just thinking about you --At my last job just as I was entering a restroom a cow-orker said Say can I grab you when youre done True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------One of the young ladies in our office is getting ready for her dream vacation to Mount Rushmore My colleague asked her to bring him back a picture of the other side of the mountain When she asked why he proceeded to convince her that on the other side of Mount Rushmore are the backs of the presidents on their knees with their heads stuck into the mountain She is so excited that she is going to look for a special tour of the backside --I went to a home improvement store to buy a new faucet for my kitchen sink I did not see the particular model I had in mind so I asked one of the Induhvidual employees for assistance He said We stopped selling that model because it was the number one theft item in the store I waited to hear the punchline until I realized he was serious I might have to find a new home improvement store if they ever achieve their goal of carrying no products worth stealing --During a round of layoffs at the company a farewell card for one unfortunate cow-orker was circulated People were signing the card with good luck and Been great working with you and so on When the card got to the desk of one manager he did not bother to read the card  He just wrote Happy Birthday and signed his name --A pool hall put up a sign in their front window that read Profound language prohibited within I could just imagine some people discussing the meaning of life and being told to take it outside --While traveling on business in Norfolk Nebraska I noticed a Ramada Inn sign Plan your next affair here The next day the sign was taken down --At a business lunch platters of calamari were passed down the tables As a platter reached one of the employees wives she was heard to remark during an unfortunate lull in the conversation No thanks I never eat anything with testicles attached The stricken silence lasted a few moments Then 150 people lost it --I work in a camera store  An Induhvidual came in and said his camera wasnt working and asked me if I could look at it  I agreed and said I would check the battery first  The Induhvidual said Ive had this battery for five years and Ive never had any problems with it before I changed the battery and the camera worked --I would like to shove a live bear cub up my bosss nose and then have the mother bear go after him whenever he opens a phone conversation with Hi buddy hows it going yeah me too --My boss was having a discussion with another employee about some work rules that pertain to people doing manual labor  He said these rules dont apply to us because we dont use manuals --Yesterday my boss called me and said Effective immediately I want you to stop your current activity and start working on this new area When I asked specifically what I was supposed to do he replied It was not my intention to give you a task today just a mind-set My Holiday Message ------------------Ive written and rewritten this section a dozen times My problem is that no matter how much I write I keep condensing it down to the same thought This holiday season as we laugh and eat and shop and enjoy friends and family our soldiers are in Afghanistan risking everything for us Some of them wont come back The rest will never be the same Every one of them volunteered They think were worth it Lets prove them right Dilbert Fodder ---------------Whats bugging you about your job  Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter  The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves

-----------------------To     Dogberts New Ruling Class DNRC From   Scott Adams scottadamsaolcom Date   November 2001 Highlights ------------------------------------------------- Scotts Patriotic Duty  Boss and Cow-orker Quotes  Holiday Gift Ideas  True Tales of Induhviduals -------------------------------------------------DNRC Update -----------There are 400000 people in the DNRC each more attractive generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free Dilbert Newsletter Maybe thats a coincidence but Im starting to doubt it My Patriotic Duty -----------------Ive been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic services in this time of global conflict I dont think Id be a good candidate for Special Ops Id be the one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying Hey guys I have sand in my shoe Is anyone else hungry Can I use my flashlight now Im already donating money to patriotic causes and I bought some plastic flags made in China but I felt I needed to do more Then it hit me There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my entire life dehumanizing the enemy In a sense thats been my full-time job for years I just need to replace the word management with Taliban So lets get started Ive been trying to figure out the Talibans long-term strategy and I think I got it Theyre trying to reverse evolution Their uncontrolled body hair is a good start Living in caves was an obvious step too The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the children But theyve made great strides in that area Have you seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day No math no social studies just rocking and chanting For PE they use sticks to whack stuffed dummies labeled Bush and Blair Im not sure how they know how to spell Bush and Blair On any given morning theyre probably whacking dummies labeled Tqwft and Upxpgt but its a good aerobic workout either way Just for fun ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum could NOT be accomplished by for example a monkey Rocking back and forth Chanting Beating a dummy with a stick Even if a monkey only got a D in chanting he would still graduate with honors from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking and whacking As I write this our generals are trying to figure out how to get the Taliban out of their caves Theyre running sophisticated war game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence I have one word for them bananas I dont want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious insults As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil I am willing to promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal footing with everyone else who doesnt read the Dilbert Newsletter Now that weve dehumanized the Taliban lets get on to the important work of dehumanizing our bosses cow-orkers and family members Induhvidual Confusion ---------------------Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others For example they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving wildlife vision and their own pants See for yourself in these true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers submitted by DNRC members ---A VP was speaking at a meeting and said Well you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him crap Someone up front said Thats drinkcant make him drink  To which the VP said Thats stupid ---In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed horse is king ---A cow-orker once said Looks like hes thrown a wrench in the monkeyworks ---A two-prawn approach is necessary ---Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the other day We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he said I was preaching to the blind ---He wont last hes just a flash in the pants ---One of the employees called in to say that she couldnt come to work because she had to have an autopsy ---My boss was telling a very involved story about something that happened to him He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a philosophical summary Sometimes fact is stranger than truth ---Its a catch 20-20 ---Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to ensure success for a campaign and his reply was Dont worry Ive got an ace up my hole ---At a management meeting my CEO said Our company is like a living orgasm Now thats what I call job satisfaction ---I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having achieved a goal The Induhvidual replied It was nothing You planted the seed and I ran with it ---In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to the carrot at the end of the tunnel ---We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this one ---These all came from the same boss Vision is in the eyes of the beholder Part of the verbiage is a language thing Eventually I want it now Its not that kind of zero There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions In the last year youve turned around 150 ---When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch room our secretary remarked to our group that she couldnt stand him because he was so ego-testicle  One of my cow-orkers spit coffee out of his nose which just added to the moment ---I think you might have hit the nail on the button ---caught between a rock and a wet spot ---And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought of a name for you IMVironment on Yahoo ---------------------Get the downloadable IM chat environment for Yahoo featuring the Dilbert characters at httpwwwdilbertcom Holiday Gift Ideas ------------------When Im not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations I believe a gift should acknowledge the recipients unique personality and interests Thats why I organized these suggestions by personality defect For Heathens Vulcans Skeptics and Dogmatics ----------------------------------------------My first non-Dilbert book Gods Debris now in hardcover is full of thought experiments about souls free will and science that will have your friends and family arguing with each other for weeks Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might even be some slapping The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put more thought into the gift than you really did Imagine how smart youll seem when you say I found all the errors in reasoning Im sure you will too We probably didnt print enough copies of Gods Debris for the holiday season really - its way more popular than I expected --so if its meant to be a gift act now Get several for your smart friends or get just one and let people borrow it You can find Gods Debris at httpwwwamazoncomexecobidosASIN0740721909unitedmedia107-5126509-7932516 People With Short Attention Spans ----------------------------------I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who cant handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of entertainment For more severe cases of attention deficit consider the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient full of unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving

--------------------------------I recommend my new book When Did Ignorance Become a Point of View Its a compilation of Dilbert comics that wont clash with anyones home decorations or wardrobe And it shows thoughtfulness because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who has Tip When its being unwrapped say Youll like this unless youre dead inside That prevents most people from complaining which is similar to being happy This book is available at httpwwwamazoncomexecobidosASIN0740718398refaseunitedmedia104-2285776-7245555 For Dyslexics --------------For dyslexics like me I

httpwwwcandy2youcomstoremerchantmvScreenCTGYStoreCodeCSCategoryCodeDAffiliateDilbert The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose Plop The Hairless Elbonian ---------------------------Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless country of Elbonia Unfortunately this isnt a good time to launch a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban So its on the shelf probably permanently You can see the experimental strips at httpwwwunitedmediacomcomicsplop Let me know what you think True Tales of Induhviduals --------------------------Here now more true tales of Induhviduals as submitted by members of the DNRC The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand reminded me of another version I heard recently  One of my relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE  It took me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had pointed out what a latrine is  They had She was apparently still intent on using it ---When I received my new credit card it had the number two 2 after my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have indicating that my name is the same as my fathers  I called the banks customer service number and asked that their records be changed to use the Roman numeral two II instead of the number two 2 The customer service rep said Im sorry sir  My computer doesnt have Roman numerals ---I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil During one performance where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing complicated acrobatics at the same time an Induhvidual behind me said to her companion That must take a lot of practice ---At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeares books because The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS ---At the grocery store the checkout woman scanned all of my items then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar code so she could scan it  She asked Do you know how much this is I said Ive changed my mind I dont think Ill buy that today She said Okay I paid her and left Dilbert Fodder ---------------Whats bugging you about your job  Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter  The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves devious strategies frustrations of dealing with others conflicting objectives unintended management consequences and of course my favorite - idiot bosses And I love True Tales of Induhviduals And if youre seeing any new management trends that need to be mocked I can help  Send your suggestions to me at scottadamsaolcom  Short ones are
