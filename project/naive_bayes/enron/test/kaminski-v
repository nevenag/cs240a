Sorry for being terse.  It is Hanover Compressor.  R2 was long swap @ $44.875 (about 5.5 MM shares) with a collar ($34.875 and $94.68), according to my information. It is presently trading around $30.

Vince,

I met with Gordon yesterday and have up-to-date information on the public and private hedges we placed in Raptors 1 and 2.  There has been value loss there.  The following are the current values for R1. I shall cross-check the values again before we model these into our liquidation valuation.
For R2, HC is the only remaining value, it appears.  However, we have already entered into a contract with Bear and Stearns who are shorting HC presently and wll settle with Enron around October, 2001, after Enron makes its sale.  So, it may not be relevant if we want to look at the liquidation value at maturity from a volatility perspective.

Thanks.

Makes sense. Let's meet with Gordon. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting. 

Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?

I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's
liquidity at some point.

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

If you have not yet registered for the June 21-22 conference, please do so
to help our planning and to obtain contact information for you.

I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual.

If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at your
hotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one at
the meeting room.  Detailed directions can be found on the website but here
is a summary from Highway 101 North & South:

      Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino
      Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.
Stay
      in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus.  At the
four-way
     stop, turn right onto Campus Drive.  Take first left (Lasuen Street)
and drive
     to the end and park.  Conference site is at this building.  If you do
not yet have
     a parking permit, we will give you one there.

I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.
Hill

Subject:	Power VAR- comments on Winton's document

Vince,

1) I agree with paragraphs 1 and 2 in Winton's document (re-running jumps and clustering and correlations of jumps).

2) Regarding 3 (fixing instability in volatilities) I would suggest implementing volatilities smoothing (see short document attached)
 
3) Also: regarding correlations. The analysis I did was showing that correlations on fixed contracts prices are much more
consistent, have less noise versus prompt, promt+1, etc prices correlations (remember those pictures?). I was suggesting
to switch to those. IT implemented this in some version a while ago, but since they don't use version control environment properly
I am not sure they still have it. This will allow us to capture also the correlations across gas and power (I experimented with NG-R6 correlations) at least for 2 prompt years. 

4) We need to ask IT to increase the number of columns in the database table which holds factors from 7 to 100. Then we (Research)
can experiment with joint factor analysis to capture term-structure of correlations across curves.

Dear Vince
I know that you are always looking for good  prospective hires so I am brin=
ging this to your attention. Armando Ugarte who is  a former Ph.D. student =
of mine is currently working for i2 in Texas but told me  recently that he =
is considering a career move. Armando has a very interesting  background co=
mbining excellent training in economics and operations research  with exten=
sive practical experience in IT working as software architect and  applicat=
ion developer for HP, Oracle and i2. I know Armando for over 14 years  sinc=
e his undergraduate studies in our department and was always fascinated by =
 his broad spectrum of talents and experience. I am enclosing his resume. I=
 do  not exactly know what his immediate plans are and if he has already an=
other job  lined up. He told me ,however , that he would like to make bette=
r use of his  education. He took the job at i2 after deciding, for personal=
 reasons, to  repatriate from Colombia where he held a faculty position. I =
highly recommend  him as a hard worker, solid and mature researcher and a v=
ery likable person. If  you are interested you should contact him directly.=
 His contact info is on his  resume.
Regards, Shmuel.

Norman,

Thanks for your message. I treat the Monday 
meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to Prediction
Company and to inform you about Enron's trading operation
and especially about our electronic trading platforms.
The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future 
collaboration. We are especially interested in working with
you on improving the algorithms that support our electronic market
making functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offer
spreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currently
a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage
of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.

I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets
and we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory character
of the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company 
participation is limited to you and Jim. We shall, of course, be glad to meet
with other associates that you may decide to bring to Houston with you. We shall be also
glad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.

Enron side will be represented by Greg Whalley,  President & COO of Enron Wholesale Services,
and myself. We expect John Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, and
my colleague from London, Dr. Steve Leppard, to join us. Shirley is forwarding the agenda and some
additional information to you tonight.

You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail addres: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home
(281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting
you on Sunday.

Vince Kaminski

Vince,

I wanted to clear up a few points about the meeting next Monday, to make it
as efficient as possible.

Re. Scope:

We are particularly interested in hearing your vision of how Prediction
Company might be able to contribute to your electronic market business.  In
doing some background reading on the niche of electronic energy markets, we
can imagine various roles we might play, but we need a more concrete vision
from you to anchor our thoughts.

If you have other major issues to cover, you could let us know, and it might
shape the roster of participants from our side.


Re. Participants:

On your side, Shirley has indicated two people, you and Greg Whalley (for at
least part of the meeting?).

Definite participants from our side are:
- Norman Packard (me) CEO.
- Jim Nusbaum, CTO, also directing new business exploration.

We could consider bringing others, depending on where we expect the
discussion to go, e.g. deeply into research issues or deeply into business
issues.  Do you have a suggestion here?


Re. Agenda:

Agenda contributions from our side could be:

NP:  Overview of Prediction Company, history, business model, contractual
situation, finances.  If desirable, I could also provide an overview of
research.

JN:  Overview of Prediction Company's existing technology, future
directions, and development potential


Re. schedule:

I will definitely be in town to meet with you for dinner Sunday evening,
7:30 at Brennan's.  I will touch base with others re. fitting Sunday dinner
into their schedules, and confirm with Shirley.  We assume the same plan for
the meeting Monday morning, 9:00 at your offices on 1400 Smith St.

Thanks again for stimulating this meeting!

    Best regards,
    Norman

PS  Shirley: thanks for sending the CD.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*	a general energy risk related topic
*	a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*	your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Hi Vince!

I need to check when I can
release this report. I have just testified,
so I think it will be any day now,
and I will then give you a password.

I will be out of days until July 5.

I see you are coming to Crete! Another chance
to talk!

Subject:=09ERCOT TCR votes

Lance and I participated in the Wholesale Market Subcommittee (WMS) meeting=
 at ERCOT yesterday.  WMS was meeting to vote on various aspects of the pro=
posed TCR design.  I'm happy to report that most votes went our way and the=
 vote we lost does not matter significantly to Enron.

The following is a brief summary of issues and the votes.

1.  Derating
We oppose derating.  I presented a few PowerPoint slides to advocate our po=
sition.  Amorng the proposals were:
a)  issue 100% of the commercially significant constraint (CSC) limit with =
non-deratable TCRs
b)  issue 100% of the CSC limit, but with deratable TCRs
c)  issue < 100% of the CSC limit with non-deratable TCRs
d)  issue X% of the CSC limit as non-deratable and 100-X % as deratable.
WMS selected option (a), where 60% of the total would be made available in =
the annual auction and the remainder would be auctioned off monthly.  All T=
CRs would be non-deratable.

2.  Closely Related Elements
The CSC is a single line.  The proposition is to introduce closely related =
elements (CREs) to create a flowgate equivalent for the CSC.  There were se=
veral votes on how to develop the CREs, if allowed, and what to do about ce=
rtain units that would complicate congestion management with CREs.  We were=
 satisfied with the decision to allow CREs, have them determined in advance=
 of the year (as is done with the CSCs), and to prohibit certain units from=
 participating in the balancing energy market when they fall between the CS=
C and a CRE.

3.  TCR Primary Auction single party quantity limit
Should a single entity be allowed to acquire the entire lot of TCRs availab=
le in an auction?  We think so.  If a party is willing to pay more than any=
body else for the TCRs, that party should be allowed to have them.  Since T=
CRs have no value beyond the realized congestion, there is always the alter=
native to simply pay the congestion.  If all TCRs are held by one party who=
 wishes to charge excessive prices for them, everybody would opt to pay con=
gestion.  The only game potential is that a party with market power in bala=
ncing energy can manipulate price spreads and gain from the TCR position.  =
This is a result of TCRs being financial and can be done whether the party =
with market power holds all TCRs or not.  Furthermore, there is no way to e=
nforce limited ownership in the secondary market, so a party wishing to con=
trol all TCRs can buy them in the secondary market or gain effective financ=
ial control.  We lost to vote to allow for complete ownership, but this pro=
vision has little effect on the market anyway.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,

Shirley: 
As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.  
The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).  
And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).
    Background
The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread.
Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines.
Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin.
For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.
    EGE Objectives
EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.
    I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).  
    II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.  
    III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.
    Specific EGE Concepts
EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.  
It produces indicative statistics such as:
    a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;
    b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;
    c. the frequency distribution of load level;
    d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;
    e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;
    f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;
    g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and
    h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated).
Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years.
EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001.
EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units.
Other EGE supporting data:
    i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);
    j. actual maximum generating capacity;
    k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);
    l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and
    m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range.
With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.
    The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy
Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy.
Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.
    Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC)
EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities.
ELC transfers its "knowledge" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:
    1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.
    2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.
    3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).
    4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron.
The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered.

I guess it's one of the challenges of the English language.

Tanya wants to ask for help in one of our new projects

We spent about an hour  with Rick explaining the rationale behind different solutions
and I think he has a better understanding of the models at this point.

I think he was asked by Jeremy to look into it.

Rick/Vince,

Should this not be a Credit/Research initiative while the business unit focuses on originating good economic transactions?  Not to be complaining, but shouldn't EES be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste resources on a project we are already moving forward on?  You can't run a portfolio model, unless you have deals in a risk system!  How complex do we want these MODELS to be?  Behavioral implications on credit default?  They still don't seem to understand.

Regards,
Bill


Mark - please attend.  You may want to include Martin to help EES understand the complexity of their deals.

Subject:	Credit Risk Model Comments - at this point.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back. 

1)	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.

2)	The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credit rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3)	Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward's where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental for a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4)	A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I mean that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't. This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn't consider. This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5)	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If we can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6)	A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments. Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enron's aggregate credit risk?

7)	There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improved" analysis could make the credit risk be higher. 

Rick

Ron:

I added to your spreadsheet the valuation of the combined Peregrine and Shortfall restrictions using an approach that Vassant and I discussed yesterday. 
It assumes: 
	1) Below $50.00 Shortfall will have restrictions on the whole number of shares (18MM shares); 
	2) Above $76.00 Peregrine will be fully rstricted.
	3) Between $50.00 and $76.00 Peregrine will bear a restriction proportional to (S-50)/(76-50) on 18MM shares and 
	   the Shorfall takes the restriction on the remaining shares.
Let's fix some time today to discuss the approach and results.

 

Thanks

You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.   I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.  
 
SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Kal,

This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project
produced. Of course, they were free to say what they thought.

Our objective is to modify the article  to such an extent that
it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms
in the energy industry.
It would be only for internal consumption and it should be  a useful source of information 
for Enron employees.


Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.

Vince -- Even if we post this internally, I have some concern about the heading of this article and with the section with recommendations for EnronOnline.  Is this something we really need to do?  If so, pls. let me know since we'll have to edit some of the text and make it very clear that this is simply an article written by some students outside Enron and Enron does not agree or disagree with the content.  We would also have to add a note that this article is for internal use only.  We can discuss and finalize on Tues.

Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Vince
 
I don't know if it makes a difference now, but I want to let you know where I'm at, at this point.  My doctors visit yesterday confirmed that the blockage has returned and some action is recommended to try and correct it.  The problem is that actions short of a by-pass leave a 40% chance of a second recurrence.  A significantly reduced work schedule seems an important part of any long term solution.
 
As a result, Ann and I plan to return to Michigan no later than February where I would take a few months to recover my health.  Part time work, at best, may then be an option for me.
 
As I expect you will have to eliminate many research positions, I would prefer to be included in the first wave.
 
I want to thank you for the opportunity to work in your group for the last year and a half.  I have enjoyed the work and the tremendous learning opportunity.  The collegial atmosphere and the broad range of expertise you have assembled made it a delight to come to work each day.  All of us have gained from the time we spent at Enron.
 
I've chosen this e-mail because I expect you will be extremely busy for the next few days.  I would be happy to talk more if you like.
 
Bob

Subject:	MRHV Model (power curve)

Dear Vince J Kaminski,

As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City
University London) I am writing my dissertation on "power
forward curves".

Since you have participated in the writing of the
book "Managing Energy Price" I was wondering if you could
eventually help me.
The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to
model the electricity forward curve.

I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean
Reverting Process, but I don't understand the MRHV (I don't
know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper,
or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to
estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean
reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).

Thank you by advance for any help

Yours sincerely
Sylvain Joret

Subject:	Denise Palmer Huggins Interview

Seminars/Forums, etc. Sub Group

I met with Denise on December 16th and here is a recap of the discussion
relative to our sub group for your information.

Seminars

-Probably no more than 4 per year
-Good curriculum makes a significant difference (ie. quality)
-Keep at a reasonable cost
-Nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50
-Denise's experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to
their skill
  base

Forums

- Broader topics than seminars with range of experts
- Can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings
- Marketing makes a big difference in turn out

Conferences

- Generally not as excited about conferences
- Shouldn't try one this year
- If do one, keep focused on one topic, not multiple tracks
- Should be lean and mean, cost effective, 2 days max

Nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and
perhaps  doing some sponsorship.  Probably should charge for non members for
these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an
opportunity.

Denise, hope this is a reasonable summary; please add anything I have left
out.
Lane

You may be particularly interested in the following new  additions:Testing =

We've also updated the  descriptive information about PSERC. That informati=

Thought you would enjoy this!


There were these two elderly people living in a  Florida 
mobile home park. He was a widower and she a widow. 
They had known  one another for a number of years. 

Now, one evening there was a community  supper in the big 
activity center. These two were at the same table, across  
from one another. As the meal went on, he made a few admiring 
glances at  her and finally gathered up his courage to ask her, 
"Will you marry  me?" 

After about six seconds of 'careful consideration,' she answered. 
"Yes. Yes, I will." 

The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges, they 
went to their respective places. 

Next  morning, he was troubled. "Did she say 'yes' or did she 
say 'no'?" He  couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just 
could not recall.    Not even a faint memory. 

With trepidation, he went to the telephone and called  her. 
First, he explained to her that he didn't remember as well as 
he used  to. Then he reviewed the lovely evening past.     As 
he gained a little more  courage, he then enquired of her, "When 
I asked if you would marry me, did  you say 'Yes' or did you 
say 'No'?" 

He was delighted to hear her say,  "Why, I said, 'Yes, yes I will' 
and I meant it with all my heart." Then she  continued, "And I 
am so glad that you called, because I couldn't remember  who had 
asked me."

Vince - 

Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group.  Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year.  Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer.  What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer. 

When we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group.

Is this okay with you?

Hope all is well  with you 

Take Care
Traci

One of the students indicated that he is
interested in a summer internship.
He came across as a very bright person,
very personable.

I can take him as a summer intern.

Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,

Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
Thank you for your time.

I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
in school.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
Thank you.

Vince,

I am just trying to make sure that all of the data is clean for your PRC meeting on Wednesday, and noticed that although Shane Green and Chris Pernoud are both specialist, Shane is Commercial Support (CS) and Chris is Specialized Technical (ST).  Please let me know if this is correct or if they should both either be ST or CS.  I am assuming that they should both be CS since the Sr. Specialist are all ST.  Additionally, I just wanted to let you know that the following people will not be rated during the meeting because their hire date was after December 31, 2000:
Anguel Grigorov
Wichai Narongwanich
Chris Pernoud
Leann Walton

Finally, please verify that you do want to do rank the assistants tomorrow.  As you know, ranking the assistants is not required, but is a business unit leader decision.  

Thanks,

   Vince this is terrible news - I paid a $1300 registration fee out of my
   research budget to get you registered - this was nonrefundable.  I hope
   that I can get Mr Lu substituted.  Can you please confirm that Mr Lu
   will be coming if we can arrange a substitution?

   Greeting from Brazil.

   Thanks for the invitation. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my
   participation
   at the conference. My associate, Zimin Lu, who has an extensive
   experience in modeling real options will go the conference in my place
   and he can participate in the panel discussion if it's OK with you.

Dear Vince

Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently
inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia,
which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an
opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as
possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.

I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852 2545
2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.

Kind regards.

Vince
You and I met last year when I had to opportunity to sit in your Energy
Derivatives class.

I work with Wil Uecker and have been trying to expand our executive
education programs for energy companies. The area that seems to have to most
interest is trading and risk management. There seems to be a market, some of
the faculty is working in this area, and it would leverage the facilities in
the new building.

We are in the very early stages of thinking about this and would welcome
your input and involvement. I have proposed that we design a fairly
comprehensive program to cover the essential competencies which
professionals in these areas master. The design should have input from both
academics and practitioners. Once we have some outline of the content, we
can address delivery options.

This is obviously vague, but I believe that it has the potential to be of
significance for the Jones School. I am also aware that other schools are
working on similar concepts. Please let me know if you have any interest in
this initiative. I would welcome your ideas and the chance to meet with you.

Hi Iris

I would not include paper 8, as paper 7 supersedes it. Also how much rewriting of these papers do you envisage? Some of them are not up-to-date, or were written poorly and under time-pressure, so what do you envisage eventually sending to Duffie?

	These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to read).

	Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,

Is this something that might be of interest to you? Should you have no

Would you know how we could get a couple of copies?  Also, if you know of any other good energy risk management books, please let me know.  Sorry to bother you with this but I figured I would ask the expert.  Thanks.

Subject:	Energy Executive Committee

Vince,

	As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have
established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class
recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy
industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as
possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up
an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable
resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global
Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth
(Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly
(Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on
the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired,
Shell Oil).

	Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a
leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the
industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would
be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to
organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it
may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7
p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you
would agree to be on the Committee.

	We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance
for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any
suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.

Best wishes,

Praveen

Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

FYI,

I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at UT.  Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for $145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.

       The Global Premier ForumforEnergy Trading & Risk  Management

                      6th - 9th November  2001, Paris


Dear Mr Kaminski,

I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you
concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again
this year - brilliant!

I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper
again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your
contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.

To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical")
topics that are already covered:



Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of
Exotic Energy  Contracts

   multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts
   adding jumps
   applying the models to  exotic energy options
   extensions to multiple  energy contracts

Les  Clewlow: Valuation and Risk Management of Virtual Power Stations and
Gas  Supply Agreements

   Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA)
   Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS)
   Valuation  methods for GSA's and VPS's
   Risk Analysis of GSA's  and VPS's



Derek Bunn, Professor of Decision  Sciences, LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL:
Analysing The Impact Of NETA On  Market Efficiency & Volatility In The UK
Energy  Market


Chris Harris,  Director of Market Development.Operations and Engineering,
INNOGY: Applying  Cutting-Edge Portfolio Management Theory In Order To
Optimise Your Risk Exposure

   Establishing  and valuing the key factors using a bottom up approach
   Looking at  the interconnection between key factors
   The treatment of the risk  of infrequent but high impact events

Peter  Nance, Principal, TEKNECON: Combining Power  Systems And Monte Carlo
Simulations For Effective  Pricing

Dan  Mansfeld, Head of Risk  Control,  VATTENFALL:  Assessing The Benefits
And Risks Of Using  Derivatives As Part Of Your Risk Management Strategy

Spyros  Maragos: Analysing New Approaches To Building Forward Curves From
Available  Market Data

Tamara  Weinert, Credit and Contracts  Manager, MIRANT  ENERGY:
Successfully Measuring & Managing Credit  Risk

   What is  Credit Risk?
   Major changes  in the industry and their impact on Credit Risk
   Effects of  new risk profiles on credit appetite: Credit analysis; Limit
   Setting; Risk  Reducing Structures
   Importance of Credit in  the Organizational Structure: Reporting;
   Dependence; Structure of Credit  Department

Brett  Humphreys: Examining Cutting-Edge Credit Exposure Mitigation Tools:
Combining  Counterparty and Portfolio Credit VaR Techniques

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured
contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)
would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else
that has not been covered  yet.

I look forward to hearing  from you,

Kind Regards,
Angelika  Staude

Darrell,

I am sending you the first document for review. It's a new algorithm
invented by Rabi De and Tanya.

The credit paper has been written but it needs more work
before we can send it to you.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

Vince,

I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.

I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.

thanks.

Joe

Joe
Thank you very much for sparing your time with me, yesterday, and explaining
Enron's dynamic and aggressive business.  It was very impressive and
intriguing.

I have revised my resume and have added information regarding the actual
systems and projects which I have worked on both for Salomon Brothers and
Toshiba.  I have attached a list of publication also.

Please feel free to let me know if you need further information.

I will await for a feedback from you, regarding where I might fit in within
the Enron organization.

Best Regards
Niki

Subject:	OStrip Function

As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered.  This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:

NowToSet 	- Fixed Price = zero
		- Forward Start = days from now until strike is set

BegDays	- Fixed Price = days from now until start of option
		- Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option

EndDays	- Fixed Price = days from now until end of option
		- Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option

FwdStFlag	- Fixed Price = 0
		- Forward Start = 1

The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The "Old Ostrip Model" did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the "Old Ostrip Model" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the "New Ostrip Model" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.

Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.

It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the "Old Ostrip Model" then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.

Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

Vince,

On Thursday at 3:00, Scott Sawyer of U of H is coming to talk to Marty Chrishman and myself about ESL (English as a second language) training for different groups.  If you would like to attend, please just let me know.

Additionally, we are offering PRC training for managers so that they can give reviews more effectively.  I know that your group could also benefit from this, and am just wondering what day and time is more convenient for your team.

Thanks,
Anne

Dear Vince and Stinson,

Today I announced my resignation from Enron. It's been very interesting and exciting 5 years and I enjoyed working with you. But for various reasons I decided that I need a fresh start in a new place. So I am moving to New York to trade crude oil financial derivatives for HETCO. I may stick around for a couple of weeks to finish up some stuff, the management should tell me today what they want. But if I leave today and cannot stop by to say good bye, then good luck to you and thanks for giving me the opportunity to work at Enron. I can be reached at pzadoro@yahoo.com.

Vince:

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

We would like to bring this student as a summer intern (the last one,

I shall send you another message regarding his proposed dates.

Thanks. I hope you have a very Happy Easter.

Vince,
 
I learned late last week that if this deal goes through, I will be joining NETCO.  Unfortunately, my responsibilities, as you can imagine, are going to change, and I will no longer be supporting your group. Kymberly Booth will be your new HR representative, and will be setting up a meeting with you shortly.  I would have liked to have been able to take the time to introduce you to Kym, but with my ski trip, I don't think that is going to be able to happen.
 
Please know though that I will always be of service to you and your great team, and if there is anything that I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to let me know.
 
Outstanding Issue:
    Rakesh:  I am going to try and get in touch with Robert Jones today so that we can get this wrapped up.
 
Thanks again for all of your kindness and support,
Anne

Eric,

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.  Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

Frank,

Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
As you can imagine, after Jeff Skilling's resignation,
Greg Whalley will be tied up in a few additional stock analysts' presentations.

We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine
and would like very much to meet and exchange opinions with you.

Please, advise me about your availability during the next 2 - 3 weeks. Hopefully, we
can reconcile our schedules and meet soon.

Vince

                                            28 November 2001

                Have Soviet-era bio-weapons infected Afghan
                refugees?

                Ominous news from Pakistan and Iran indicate that at best a viral
                pandemic may be brewing among Afghan refugees, at worst that
                former Soviet biological weapons have possibly made their first
                appearance. 

                In Pakistan, at least 75 people have been diagnosed in Quetta,
                capital of Baluchistan province, with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
                fever in the largest outbreak of the disease ever recorded. Eight
                have already died. All the infected are refugees recently arrived
                from Afghanistan or people living close to the border. An isolation
                ward surrounded by barbed wire has been established at the Fatima
                Jinnah chest and general hospital in Quetta. 

                Ali-Safar Makaanali, head of Iran's Border Quarantines, has
                confirmed that Iranian health officials are also dealing with an
                outbreak of the virus, with more than 100 citizens having been
                infected. Iranian health authorities have established 40 quarantine
                bases on the border in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease.
                In addition, more than 100 mobile quarantine bases have been set
                up, and 39 hospitals have been prepared to cope with patients. As
                the traditional infection vector are ticks and as refugees would
                undoubtedly bring their livestock with them, the possibility of a
                pandemic looms large, especially if the current campaign causes a
                flood of refugees.

                The virus has a mortality rate of over 50 per cent, damaging
                arteries, veins and other blood vessels before leading to the
                collapse of major organs, eventually causing its victim to die of
                internal bleeding. The disease is highly infectious and can be
                transmitted via contact with infected individuals. 

                Soviet biological arsenal at large

                What makes the viral outbreak menacing is the knowledge that in
                the 1980s the USSR's biological warfare research organisation
                Biopreparat intensively studied biological weapons and maintained
                a bank of 10,000 of the most dangerous and exotic viruses known,
                including smallpox, Ebola and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.
                Many intelligence analysts believe that Osama bin Laden acquired
                biological weapons agents from Kazakh arms dealers.

                Therefore, it begs the question: Are the Iranian and Pakistani
                outbreaks an unfortunate coincidence or something more sinister?

I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get
a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that
I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension 
.pdf  and begin with teh same string of characters.
Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.

Kevin,

Please, take a look at the link to the website
describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission
DC line from Canada and Maine to  NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below.

The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.

Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. 


Any interest?

Vince

Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these
corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts
traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of
the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary
services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge
for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in
whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the
summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an
anchor tenant concept).

As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow
in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll
keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual
challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.

Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

Ed

Dear All,

Paul briefed me today that my last day withe Enron Australia will be the 14th Dec. Next step would be to determine my first day with Enron in Houston? 

My wife booked holiday accommodation until the 19th Dec. for a place up the coast (before today's decision). 

Could we please have a call to determine the date of my first day in Houston? 
Maybe in approx. 5 hours time (for the call)?

Dear Band of Brothers!  (sorry...I'm reading Ambrose's book by the same name)

Scott Tholan and I thought it'd be cool to pull together the old Skunk Works crew for a reunion.  The goal of the meeting is to brainstorm data collection technologies and applications to better serve Enron customers -->> we want to get ahead of customer needs rather than forever being reactive to requirements blowing in from left field.  This is not necessarily about dreaming up whiz-bang technologies.  It's about pooling our knowledge of customer information gaps, and identifying old/new technologies to collect data that make our customers smarter and richer. 

 A steady flow margaritas would free the collective brainpower and creativity.  Who else is cleared into TAC programs and should be a part of this shindig?

Scott's out next week, so let's shoot for Tues, 11 SEP.  Let's say from 1500hrs until??  I'm serious about the margaritas.......

Any problems with this date/time?

Many thanks and looking forward to a good session!

 Ciao - Chris

Hi Vince,

How are you?

I'm doing well at the new job.

I heard the news from Shirley. It's something we expected but
confirmation of the expectation seemed like ultimatum, which is sad.
As I mentioned before, I would like to have a lunch with you and listen
some career advice from you sometime this week or any time at your
convenience.  Is it O.K. with you?

Sincerely,

Jaesoo

Subject:	ENRON: DRI-WEFA Agriculture Commodity Submission

Dear Jennifer,

It was a pleasure to meet with you last week.  As part of our follow-up I
have prepared a preliminary proposal outlining DRI.WEFA's ability to provide
agriculture and fertilizer commodity data as well as freight rate
information (truck, rail and barge) in support of your fundamental analysis
at ENRON.

As I mentioned, Kemm Farney and I also met with Jeff Andrews.  We have
already forwarded on to him our Coal Monthly service, which is part of
ENRON's current services package.  We have also forwarded our forecast of
the current RCAF for coal, taken from our US Energy service (also a part of
your current package).

As discussed, the plan for follow-up is to have you and your colleagues
review this submission.  With your feedback, we will then present these
capabilities in a more detailed format that will include additional service
options.  Our current plan is to return to Houston in mid-June for this
purpose.

I have attached an Agriculture and Fertilizer Commodity Spreadsheet that
details the commodity type, forecast frequency, domestic and/or
international coverage.  I have also mapped the commodity price forecast
capability to the actual DRI.WEFA publication so that you can sample the
output.  All content is delivered electronically.  Telephone access is
always included.  Onsite presentations are available and customized white
paper reports can also be included.  Further consultative work tailored your
specific requirements can be included. Fees for these services, depending on
amount and frequency as well as customization, if any will likely fall in
the range of $10,000 to $30,000 annual. With your feedback we can better
tailor a package and establish fees.

Please review the attached spreadsheet and the accompanying attachments to
this email reviewing the DRI-WEFA Agriculture Services as well as a recent
PPT presentation. The spreadsheet refers to attachments and these will be
forwarded to you under a separate email from the head of the Agriculture
Services, Dr. Harry Baumes.

I look forward to discussing this submission with you and I'll plan to
follow-up next week to hear your comments.  Perhaps we can schedule our
presentation in Houston at that time.

As you can imagine, with the merger between WEFA and DRI many service issues
need to be finalized. We remain committed, however, to serving your
interests in a timely and professional manner.  We will therefore,
independent of this submission, review your combined WEFA/DRI services to
ensure we have the most efficient and appropriate set of services in place.
I have attached the press release announcing the merger for your review.

Regards, Peter

Hi Julie,

Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the 
book as the main source. You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock
and probably order a few more copies.

I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped
with work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.

The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night)
but we survived without major problems. The only problem I had was an overflowing 
swimming pool (it took 45 minutes to go  from a comfortable slack to a full condition).

Vince

Vince,
 
Hope you are well.  
 
We've been in contact with Rice University's bookshop and they informed us  that they have a few books left over from the course.  We told them  originally that if they didn't sell them all we would take them back.  We  would rather have them sent over to you as complimentary copies if that's  OK with you?
 
What's new?  Busy summer so far?  Hope that the storm didn't  cause you any problems.
 
Julie

      Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering
   positions.
      Our
      needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle,
      WebLogic,
      and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those
   specific
      frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration
   needs
      in a
      few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
      interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job
   descriptions
      and
      forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in
      Mathematica
      (for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work
   took
      him
      into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in
   his
      ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who
   know
      how
      to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system
   designers
      at
      IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro
      hard
      drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to
      him.

      Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

         Hi Vince -
         I wanted to check on a couple of items following our discussions
      earlier
         this year: 1) has your son decided where he will work? and 2) will
      you
         be in
         Boston for the Risk 2001 conference?
         Development is moving along at a good pace here at Opt4.
         Best regards,
         Bill Balson

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Update:

Preparations for the upcoming Texas Finance Festival III are about complete
and I just wanted to update you on the hotel reservations information.  You
will need to make your reservation before March 20 to be assured of getting
a room in our reserved block.  Also, for "counting" purposes I need
everyone's registration form completed.  Many of you (and a lot of new
faces) have already sent them in but some may not have, so . . .

Lots of fun stuff is planned so come prepared for a very relaxing and
productive weekend!

Jose,

Thank you for your interest in Enron. 
I don't know at this point if we are going to offer any
internships in the summer of 2002.

My assistant, Shirley Crenshaw,  will send you the reprints of my publications.

	Dear Dr. Kamiski,


        I am a student of the master in Quantitative Computational Finance
in Georgia Tech and also a Ph.D. student of the school of Mathematics. I
had the opportunity of attending the talk you gave in Georgia Tech two
weeks ago. I found the field and your work extremely interesting and
exciting. Since I am finishing the master degree in QCF this Fall and I
am in the initial  stages of my dissertation research, I am really looking
forward to having exposure to some real problems that the industry has
related to price modeling and pricing of financial instruments. I believe
that such a exposure will serve to motivate my dissertation and research.

        I firmly believe that my mathematical background is particularly
suitable for the problems you explained in your talks. I have another
master degree in Statistics and probability, in which I had exposure to
practical and theoretical aspects of statistics and probability. As part
of my master dissertation, I had the opportunity to study in depth
Self-similar Stochastic Processes and Levy Processes with particular
emphasis on papers of Taqqu, Samorodnitsky, Sato, Mandelbrot, and
Bandorff-Nielsen. Also, I have extensive experience in C and Java
programming as well as standard statistical and mathematical packages like
MatLab, Maple, S-plus, Minitab, and Statgraphics. You can read my
resume attached to the e-mail.

        I am really interested in working on an internship next Spring
and/or Summer in your group or maybe to work individually with you in
reading sections and research projects related to the energetic field.

	One last thing, I wonder if you can provide me with a copy of your
slices or some bibliography.

	Thanks for your time and I expect to hear from you.

	Sincerely yours,

	Jose E. Figueroa-Lopez

Subject:	VAR Engine question

Frank,

Concerning our ongoing discussions on the proper capture of ancillary and renewable energy credit positions in VAR, I have a proposed solution that I would like to run by you to ensure that proper valuation for these positions will be captured by your VAR engine.  As the positions are marked on their own curve but are valued for VAR purposes using the volatility curves and correlation factors for an energy curve, the VAR on these positions is obviously inaccurate.  As a result, the traders will be setting volatility curves and correlation factors today which will be unique for each ancillary/energy credit position.  All of the correlation factors will be zero and a majority of the volatility curves will be zero, as well.  I simply wanted to ensure that your model would not have a problem with volatilityies or correlations of zero.  I would appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks.
Casey

Dear Giuseppe:

Unfortunately, I am no longer with the Associate and Analyst recruiting department and will be unable to assist you directly.  Please contact Tracy Warner, who is now responsible for recruiting.  She will be able to assist you directly.  Tracy can be contacted at Tracy.Warner@Enron.com.  I would also recommend having Vince Kaminski contact her as well to ensure that all communications are in order.

Celeste, my name is Giuseppe A. Paleologo and you amy remember me: I was
a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the
hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal
offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a
written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not
received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is
still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the
process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before
I make my final decision.

Thanks in advance,

Giuseppe Paleologo

Dear Vince,

We've been asked by our clients for our view on Enron's situation and
outlook. I feel a need to respond to these requests and have written the
attached one-pager.

I would like to offer you -- my primary contact at Enron -- an opportunity
to review and correct any factual errors. Interpretations, of course, remain
my responsibility.

I reiterate my long-standing admiration for the Company and all it has
contributed. I have had an opportunity to discuss the prospect with people
in policy positions and desire first of all to do no harm by misstatement
and second to be as helpful as I can be.

If you choose not to comment I will understand that as well, but would
appreciate some indication on your part. I will of course keep our
correspondence on this between us in any event. Thanks.

Ed

To:		All EBS Employees Worldwide

From:		EBS Office of the Chairman

Subject:	Changes at EBS

Date:		July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.

Hi Vince:
 
Hope the Enron crisis hasn't turned you upside down personally...
 
I'm going to be in Houston next week on a client call, and wondered if  you'd be interested in having breakfast Wednesday or Thursday.  We're  hoping to open an RCM office in Houston, and I wanted to speak to you to see if  you had any ideas on how we might staff it.

Eric,

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

Elena,

Please, prepare for Mulong NG and power price series. 
We can use  Henry Hub for NG, Cinergy, Cobb and PV for electricity.
 
We can send him NG price right away. Electricity prices are different: he has to obtain

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Mulong

Shijie,

My apologies for the delay. As you know we have hit some turbulence here at Enron
and I was quite busy.

The title of the talk:


Measurement of  Volatility in the Energy Markets:

1. Importance  of volatility in financial engineering
	a. option pricing
	b. risk management
	c. legacy software systems

2. Is volatility the right tool for energy markets?

3. The dynamics of energy prices in the US markets in recent years: a few stylized facts

4. Alternative theoretical tools to represent price dynamics: the importance 
   of dialogue between academics and practitioners


Also, can you give me some indication of the timing
of different meetings?

Vince

DPC lenders' Singapore meet inconclusive
=20
THE CRUCIAL talks between the foreign and Indian lenders of US energy major=
 Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company at Singapore remained inconclusive on =
Tuesday and are slated to continue on Wednesday. "The meeting has spilled o=
ver to the second day with DPC to participate in the proceedings on Wednesd=
ay," financial institutions sources said. The sources said Enron India mana=
ging director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor were likely to p=
articipate in the second day of the meeting. They said the meeting, which w=
ent on for over an hour, discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes=
 between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. "Nothing has been=
 finalised as yet," they said when asked whether both the Indian and foreig=
n lenders were able to arrive at any solution for solving the current statu=
s quo. At the Singapore meet, the lenders have come together to try and dif=
fuse the tension and unite the two "warring partners" - DPC and MSEB.=20

The foreign lenders were expected to be updated by their Indian counterpart=
s about developments like DPC's preliminary termination notice to MSEB, whi=
ch in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the mult=
inational from May 29. The Indian lenders would press for completion of the=
 $3-billion project, as DPC has stopped commercial production and doubts ar=
e being expressed for commissioning of its 1,444-mw phase-II, due on Thursd=
ay. The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India executiv=
e director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member, along with representa=
tives of State Bank of India and ICICI. The foreign lenders include a conso=
rtium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim Bank and Opic. (PTI)

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20
Lenders split over DPC transfer notice to MSEB ,  Pradipta Bagchi=20
Lenders to the $ 2.9-billion Dabhol Power Company are split over whether DP=
C should be allowed to issue a transfer notice to MSEB. Last Friday, Enron =
sought the lenders' permission--for the second time in a month--to issue a =
transfer notice to MSEB. A transfer notice allows the valuation of all fixe=
d assets to begin with and is the first step in starting the process of tra=
nsfer of assets to the MSEB. While domestic lenders like IDBI, ICICI and SB=
I--with an exposure of more than Rs 5,000 crore to the project--are opposin=
g the move to issue a transfer notice, most foreign lenders including the l=
ead arrangers to the project are now agreeable to the transfer notice being=
 issued by the DPC. On the first day of lenders' deliberations in Singapore=
, vast differences emerged between the domestic and foreign lenders in this=
 regard.=20
While domestic lenders are worried about the impact of the huge exposure on=
 their balance sheets, foreign lenders, who typically have smaller exposure=
, are of the opinion that without any alternative concrete solutions, it ma=
y be worthwhile to pull the plug on the project. ``Without any concrete sol=
utions and no fixed time-frame, foreign lenders are not willing to go to th=
eir respective credit committees for further disbursals,'' a lender from Si=
ngapore told The Times of India. ``There is no point throwing more good mon=
ey after bad, is the consensus among foreign lenders,'' said the lender.=20
Among other issues discussed on the first day of the meetings was whether t=
he lenders should throw Enron out of the project and take over the operatio=
ns of DPC. However, without a proper team of skilled managers in place, it =
is unlikely that the lenders will risk throwing out the current operators. =
Fresh disbursals from the lenders are unlikely. Among the first casualties =
will be an Enron affiliate company, which is the EPC contractor for the LNG=
 terminal. On June 8, a payment of $ 13 million is to be made to the LNG co=
ntractor, which will not be disbursed by the lenders. Another big payment o=
f $ 25 million has to be made to Bechtel, the EPC contractor for the power =
plant, by June 18 as well.=20
Enron and DPC officials will make a presentation on Wednesday to the banker=
s, following which, further deliberations will be held among the lending ba=
nks.

DPC lenders meet opens on a positive note

The first day of the crucial meeting between the Indian and international l=
enders in Singapore has opened on a positive note with the foreign lenders =
showing signs of giving more time to Indian government to resolve the probl=
em.=20

Foreign lenders are enthused by the fact that the Centre is ready to give i=
ncentives to the project so that DPC can reduce its tariff. The Centre' pac=
kage include cutting interest rate on the project, and asking the Central E=
lectricity Authority (CEA) to work out a contingency plan for sale of power=
 to other States from the Dabhol power project.''The international lenders =
are ready to give some more time to find out a solution. Lenders will take =
the maximum hit if the Enron pulls the plug into the project,'' FI sources =
said. Hence, the rethinking among the international lenders. The Centre's p=
ackage, to be ready in another two months, would also lower the customs dut=
y on imported LNG which would further help the company to lower the tariff.

Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor =
are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting on Wednesday to =
present their side of the story. Tuesday's meeting, which went on for over =
an hour, discussed the on-going financial and legal disputes between DPC an=
d its partner Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).At the meet, the l=
enders have come together to try and diffuse escalated tension and unite th=
e two warring partners, DPC and MSEB, say FI sources.=20

While loans from international FIs enjoy the Indian government guarantee, i=
t would be Indian FIs which will have to take the maximum hit if the projec=
t gets derailed. On Tuesday, the foreign lenders were updated by the Indian=
 counterparts over series of events like DPC's Preliminary Termination Noti=
ce to MSEB, which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing powe=
r from the multinational from May 29. The Indian team is led by Industrial =
Development Bank of India (IDBI) executive director R S Agarwal, who is als=
o DPC board member, along with representatives of State Bank of India and I=
CICI. The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA=
, Japan Exim bank and OPIC.=20

 The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess=
 the viability of despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states =
across the country, announced the Union minister of state for power Jayavan=
tiben on Tuesday. Mehta said that the CEA, which has been asked to undertak=
e this exercise recently, will take into account the burden to be borne by =
various power deficit states during the despatch of power. Currently, if th=
e power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid, there is c=
ertain fixed charge imposed on it. "The CEA will have to carry out this exe=
rcise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Da=
bhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase t=
hat power," the minister added. Mehta said that the centre will not purchas=
e Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take the additional burden on the=
m. She informed that the union finance ministry in no uncertain terms made =
it clear that the centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheape=
r rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 crore =
to various central public sector undertakings. Mehta said that prime minist=
er AB Vajpayee who has been apprised him of the present situation on the Da=
bhol front has assured to provide necessary assistance especially technical=
 one to resolve the issue.

DPC lenders to resume talks today in Singapore=20

 THE two-day talks to resolve Dabhol tangle opened on a positive note in Si=
ngapore on Tuesday.Sources in Indian financial institutions (IFIs) told The=
 Financial Express that the IFIs comprising representatives of IDBI, ICICI,=
 State Bank of India (SBI) met to chalk out their strategy at the two-day m=
eeting with offshore lenders and Enron officials. The Indian team was lead =
by Mr RS Agarwal, IDBI executive director, along with the other officials f=
rom other lending institutions including those from the SBI and ICICI.Appar=
ently, the IFIs, on Tuesday revived their efforts to convince DPC's offshor=
e lenders to maintain "restraint" to save the Dabhol project. The meeting b=
etween the IFIs and their foreign counterparts remained inconclussive on Tu=
esday. The foreign lenders are expected to take a clear stand on Wednesday.

Interestingly, the meeting is expected to be participated by members of the=
 DPC on the second day, said financial institutions sources. The sources sa=
id, Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGre=
gor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting. The meeting=
 was also attended by a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim=
 Bank and OPIC. According to sources in IDBI: "The foreign lenders have giv=
en us a patient hearing to our views suggesting that they should not precip=
itate the crisis by any of their further moves." The sources said the IFIs =
are determined to take up the issue of completion of the Dabhol phase-II in=
 view of 90 per cent of its completion. "The IDBI has recieved a mandate fr=
om the government that an all-out effort be made to save the Dabhol project=
," the sources added.

The offshore lenders are believed to have sought various details with refer=
ence to the payment guarantees from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=
 (MSEB) as well as fulfilment of contractual obligations in the wake of rev=
oking of the power purchase agreement. The IFIs are likely to press for the=
 revocation of suspension of loan disbursement by offshore lenders so that =
phase-II be completed. The offshore lenders had suspended loan disbursement=
 after the DPC board meeting of London on April 25.=20

BUSINESS STANDARD, Wednesday, June 06, 2001
MSEB refuses DPC power at 90% PLF, Renni Abraham
 The Maharashtra government will not buy power from the first phase of the =
Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) project at a 90 per cent plant load factor (PL=
F), a senior state government official said here today. The statement repre=
sents a hardening of Maharashtra's position on talks with DPC and virtually=
 kills the latter's proposal to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtr=
a. The Maharashtra State Electri- city Board (MSEB) is now required to buy =
90 per cent of the power generated by the first phase (740 mw) of the proje=
ct. But during negotiations with the Godbole Committee, it has been demandi=
ng that the requirement be cut to 35 per cent. At the last Godbole Committe=
e meeting, DPC had put forward a plan to split tariffs for the Centre and M=
aharashtra, with the Centre paying Rs 3.30 per unit of power and MSEB payin=
g Rs 3.50.=20
The Centre, DPC suggested, could buy two-thirds of the power it generated, =
once the second phase (1,444 mw, taking the total capacity to 2,184 mw) was=
 completed. Maharashtra's latest position undermines DPC's proposal since t=
he Enron-promoted company's tariff hinges on MSEB absorbing 90 per cent of =
the power it generates in the first phase. A senior state government offici=
al said: "The Centre has been talking a lot about playing the role of a fac=
ilitator. What we need is a buyer for the second phase." Despite recent cen=
tral government pronouncements, state government officials privately argue =
that the Centre is not playing an active role in resolving the problems tha=
t have plagued the DPC project. At the very first Godbole Committee meeting=
 he attended, the Centre's nominee, AV Gokak, adopted a non-committal stand=
. The Maharashtra government official added: "Gokak said he was merely atte=
nding the meeting in the capacity of a messenger and would communicate to t=
he Centre any solution worked out by the renegotiation committee. The Union=
 power ministry has stated that a solution worked out by the renegotiation =
committee would be acceptable to it. Unless the Centre takes an active part=
 and assures the offtake of the second phase, no solution can be worked out=
."

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20
Dabhol says ready to extend conciliation , Shaji Vikraman , Balaji C. Mouli=
=20

THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has accepted the Finance Ministry's proposal=
 for a two months' extension for the conciliation process. The extension wi=
ll be effective from June 7. This development is perceived by the Governmen=
t as a positive signal as it offers more leeway to work out a solution to r=
esolve the Dabhol crisis. DPC's nod for an extension, which was communicate=
d to the Finance Secretary on Monday, is subject to the Government acceding=
 to the company's stand on the ongoing arbitration proceedings. The company=
 has said that it would continue to pursue the arbitration proceedings whic=
h have already been initiated by the company, according to senior Ministry =
officials. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA), conciliation and arbit=
ration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the t=
wo parties. Normally, arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fa=
ils. However, in this case, DPC has dragged MSEB to the arbitration forum e=
ven as the conciliation process is being pursued.=20

DPC has already slapped three arbitration notices on the Maharashtra State =
Electricity Board (MSEB). The first notice was issued to the board for its =
failure to honour the December 2000 bill of Rs 102 crore and the January 20=
01 bill of Rs 111.6 crore while two other notices were for failures to hono=
ur the Maharashtra Government's State support agreement and the supplementa=
ry State support agreement. The conciliation process was adopted in the wak=
e of the dispute arising over the settlement of DPC's December bills of Rs =
102 crore, followed by the MSEB's counter claim of Rs 400 crore for the sam=
e period.=20

The conciliation process was agreed upon on April 7 and was to be concluded=
 in two months. However, simultaneously, arbitration proceedings were trigg=
ered between DPC and MSEB. With the conciliation process making little head=
way, the Finance Ministry sought an additional two months time for concludi=
ng the process. Prior to that, the Attorney General's interpretation of the=
 MSEB-DPC contract was that the payment could be made to DPC only if the bi=
ll was undisputed. Hence, the Centre decided to opt for the conciliation pr=
ocess.=20

During recent meetings between the Government and the DPC officials, the la=
tter had pointed out that if the Government was able to work out a package =
in six months, it would withdraw its termination notice and reamin in the p=
roject for up to a year. The Finance Ministry officials feel that the Centr=
e has been dragged into the DPC controversy well beyond its contractual obl=
igation. ``The Centre's involvement in DPC-MSEB issue is restricted to the =
first phase. The fate of the second phase is entirely a matter between the =
MSEB and DPC,''they said.=20

Analysts feel that the Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu's words of hope to =
defuse the Dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality. ``The Centre is totti=
ng sale of Dabhol power to third-party as a key solution. However, first, u=
nder the existing electricity laws, the Centre cannot authorise third-party=
 sale since it is in the State's domain. Secondly, since it is a purely com=
mercial decision, the Central Electricity Authority's (CEA) intervention do=
es not offer any significant breakthrough.'' Recently, the Power Ministry h=
ad instructed the CEA to survey the demand requirement of neighbouring Stat=
es over the next two years as well as their purchase price.=20

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001=20
MSEB unruffled amid power talk , Dinesh Narayanan=20

EVEN as officials from various financial institutions and banks split hairs=
 in Singapore on whether to sink or sail with the Dabhol power project, the=
 Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is cool about the entire affair=
. Unlike previous instances when the odds were stacked against it, this tim=
e MSEB knows pretty well that whatever happens, it will remain unscathed. I=
f someone has to take a hit, it has to be the financiers and maybe the Gove=
rnments.At the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Author=
ity (MERC), the Advocate-General, Mr Goolam Vahanvati, had said on behalf o=
f the board that MSEB was being kind towards Enron when it rescinded the co=
ntract for ``material misrepresentation''. One more step, and it's fraud, h=
e had told MERC.=20

Knowing this fully well, MSEB has kept its cool throughout the altercation.=
 It firmly believes that if nothing else, it can pin down the company on ju=
st this one point at any forum. Enron too has not said at any point of time=
 that it can actually perform as per the ``cold-start graph'' in the power =
purchase agreement. In fact, it has said such performance -- making availab=
le full power in 180 minutes -- is ``not possible'' by any such plant in th=
e world. In a way, it was MSEB's defiant posturing coupled with the Maharas=
htra Government's passing the buck up that got the Central Government to ac=
t.=20

One thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying =
to save their own skin. In spite of the developments, Enron has played its =
cards close to its chest, and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its=
 returns only a few days ago. Even that, Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, =
Enron India Pvt Ltd, is reported to have told Indian lenders, would hinge o=
n substantial give and take. Indian lenders have a genuine case in that the=
y are the ones without any assurances apart from the plant itself. And, the=
y are not in the business of running power plants. They cannot do much exce=
pt try get the players to somehow shake hands. They had tried to convince t=
he Government some time ago to get MSEB to activate the escrow and increase=
 the letter of credit amount. But they were told off by MSEB which was in n=
o mood to relent. Today's meeting in Singapore remained inconclusive and th=
e talks will continue tomorrow. Tomorrow, Enron will make presentations to =
lenders at Singapore on what it feels can be done to move ahead. Whatever t=
he outcome of the meeting, MSEB is unlikely to agree to anything that might=
 queer its pitch.=20

CEA to assess viability of Dabhol power despatch to various states' ,   San=

THE Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess =
the viability of the despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit stat=
es across the country, Union  minister of state for power Jayavantiben Meht=
a on Tuesday. Ms Mehta told The Financial Express that the CEA, which has b=
een asked to undertake this exercise recently, will take into account the b=
urden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of po=
wer. Currently, if the power has to be transported from eastern grid to wes=

e whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states=
 are keen to purchase that power," the minister added. Ms Mehta said that t=
he Centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take th=
e additional burden on them.=20

She informed that the Union finance ministry had in no uncertain terms made=
 it clear that the Centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheap=
er rate to the states, especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 cror=
e to various Central public sector undertakings. Ms Mehta said that Prime M=
inister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who has been apprised of the present situatio=
n on the Dabhol front, has assured that he would provide necessary assistan=
ce, especially technical, to resolve the issue. "The Centre is quite eager =
for the resolution of issue and will provide necessary cooperation," she ad=
ded.

Ms Mehta said that she had a meeting with the representatives of the Bank o=
f America and ABN Amro before they left for the Singapore meeting. "These l=
enders explained their position and the amount involved in the Dabhol plant=
. However, they also expressed their wish to participate in finding an acce=

Gujarat, Up High on Power Reforms, By Rajesh Unnikrishnan

Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat are moving ahead with implementing reforms=
 in the power sector, even as the reforms in Maharashtra have come to a sta=
ndstill due to the Dabhol fiasco. Maharashtra was one of the first states t=
o initiate steps for reforms phase-II, by appointing a state regulatory com=
mission and going in for unbundling MSEB. Uttar Pradesh State Electricity B=
oard and Delhi Vidyut Board are finalising plans to privatise transmission =
and distribution, while Gujarat is planning to set up one more power projec=
t with private sector participation.=20

According to State Bank of India Capital Markets officials, UPSEB is going =
to float a new tender, inviting private sector players for power supply in =
Kanpur region. Due to employees' protests against the privatisation, the st=
ate electricity board had cancelled its earlier tender floated in 2000.  SB=
I Caps had also short-listed four companies: L&T, CESC, BSES and Tata Power=
 for transmission and distribution in Kanpur. The officials said: "UPSEB wi=
ll come out with a new tariff order for Kanpur by this week end and a new t=
ender will be floated by month-end. We would undertake the short-listing pr=
ocess by mid-July."They said that besides this, the UP State Industrial Dev=
elopment Corporation is also setting up a 30 MW captive power project for t=
he newly-developed industrial park, Tronica City, in the state. Total cost =
of the project is estimated at Rs 100 crores and BHEL is the equipment supp=
lier for the project.

SBI Caps short-listed six private players for supplying power in three regi=
ons Tata Power, BSES, Reliance Power, China Light&Power, AES, the AV Birla =
Group and CESC. Two months back, the Delhi government had cleared State Ban=
k of India Caps' proposal for the unbundling of DVB by dividing the board i=
nto five separate units. The proposal envisaged three transmission and dist=
ribution companies and two generation companies. DVB makes losses to the tu=
ne of Rs 1 crore per day. Officials said the Gujarat, on the other hand, is=
 focussed more on generation and the state electricity board recently propo=
sed a 500 MW project in Mundra and invited a proposal from the private sect=
or.

The project will use imported coal as fuel and the state will keep a minimu=
m equity in it. There are two independent power projects in Gujarat: the Re=
liance-promoted, 500 MW, naphtha-based Hazira project and the 500 MW, gas-b=
ased project promoted by Gujarat Power Corporation. According to the offici=
als, the unbundling of Gujarat SEB has failed to take off because the state=
 government has not yet appointed any merchant banker for it. The governmen=
t initiated the state electricity board unbundling around two years back.

Kim,

I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages)
and he mentioned an interview with you. 

He is a very bright and capable individual and he would
be a good fit to your group. 

Vince


P.S.  He looks better without the pony tail.

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forwa=
rd to others in your group.
=20
Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile D=
iabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) walk.  This year the walk will be held o=
n Sunday, October 28, 2001, at Greenspoint Mall.
=20
As some of you may know, Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that=
 is very important to him.  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty=
pe 1, insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes. =
 The other type of diabetes is Type 2, adult-onset diabetes that can often =
be controlled with a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication.  Ev=
ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times=
, in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin.  Jus=
t think of it, at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee=
dle to manage his disease.  I don't know about you, but I am a wimp if I ha=
ve to get a shot just once every few years and I can't even begin to imagin=
e what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week!  B=
ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week, it is every day of every we=
ek for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found.  Diabetics can never =
take a break from their disease.  It requires constant management of their =
food intake, monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the =
proper amount of insulin.  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead =
to kidney disease or failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations, among =
other complications.
=20
I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort=
s with the JDRF walk again this year.  I am serving on the steering committ=
ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo=
r this terrible disease.  I am doing this to support Mike, but I also have =
a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure.  My husban=
d has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to=
 diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago.  In addition, I =
have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes.
=20
I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi=
s year.  It would mean a lot to me (and to Mike) to have support from the p=
eople in our Enron Global Markets organization, as well as people from prev=
ious groups we have worked with, along with other friends throughout Enron.
=20
Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak=
e this opportunity to say thank you very much!  For those of you that have =
not yet signed up, please consider one of the following three opportunities=
 that are available to give your support to this important effort:
1.      Team Leader.  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the =
collecting and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers.  Based =
on the donations raised by your group, you may also be eligible for prizes =
available only to team leaders.  If you are interested in becoming a team l=
eader, please contact me right away so that I may get the team leader infor=
mation and materials to you.=20
2.      Walkers.  If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF, =
I will make sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up!  The JDR=
F walk is a very fun event with music, entertainment and great food.  All w=
alkers are asked to raise at least $25 in donations and will receive a grea=
t T-shirt to wear the day of the walk.=20
3.      Supporters.  If it just is not possible for you to join us for the =
walk on October 28th, then please sign up as a supporter by sending a retur=
n e-mail with your pledge amount and you will be contacted later in October=
 for collection of the donation.=20
The bottom line is raising money to support research to find a cure!  The J=
uvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is very well managed and for every dol=
lar that is donated to JDRF, over 85 cents goes directly to research.  In a=
ddition, this year Enron will match all donations dollar for dollar.
=20
Thank you for your support, time and efforts.  And please, let's Walk to Cu=
re Diabetes!

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Norman,

My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.

Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in
Northern England. The accident coincided with Greg's trip to London
and Greg got immersed in all the problems related to it. 

I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back 
to Houston.

I regret to inform that I am terminating my job with Enron today 12/06/2001. Despite the later events I had a great time working with everyone in this company. More particularly, I will miss a lot of the excitement and learning opportunities that The Research propitiated in this last 3 years.

I will be pursuing new opportunities in a different company and as soon as I settle I will inform my new contact info. I will still be residing here in Houston I and I am looking forward to continuing nurturing the friendship we developed throughout these years.

Many thanks.

Vince,

Pursuant to our conversation, I called Jim Kenney (281-297-3557), head of Entergy Management Operations (EMO), which is the entity responsible for ETR's 4-state regulated system.  He indicated that they were looking for someone with IS skills to manage their EMS.  The point of contact for this is Charles Sanders (281-297-3575).  Jim indicated it would be a combination of Hardware/Software skills.  Entergy has a very large and complex regulated system, and I would assume that the EMS (responsible for real-time decisionmaking for Generation response to load) would be quite complex and challenging.  He indicated that he would write a note to Charles to expect your call.  If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Best Regards,
Dale

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Dear Vince,
How are you doing? It was very nice seeing you the other day, and hope everything is fine with you.
Sorry for the delay in email, I was very busy moving for the past few days. Will you email me your personal email account? I don't want to lose contact with you. And I can be reached by my lifetime email account:li.sun.wg00@wharton.upenn.edu 
It is pretty sad to witness what is happening at Enron, and all you were worried about before is coming true earlier than expected. I wish we should have done more to prevent this from happening.
Anyway, I am planning to leave the country and go back to China as I am only allowed to stay here for at most 60 days after employment termination. Please keep in touch, and if you have chance, please come and visit me in Beijing, it will be my honor to be your tour guide and show you around.
Happy holidays and wish you all the best!
Li

Vince,

As I mentioned in my voice mail, Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody, a recent MBA grad from Rice, into his group.  However, when we were talking about this position, Mike compared Sara to Elena.  Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also.  Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work.  

I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.  If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K).  Please advise.

Thanks,
Anne

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

Hello Rakesh and Gwen,
 
 
I am sorry that I have been out of pocket all week and did not have access to my e-mail.  I have just returned from NY and want to thank you for all of your hard work in helping us track the data.  You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.   I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.  
 
SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.
 
Again, thank you very much for all of your help.

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Subject:	Meeting with Gordon on Raptor



I have talked with Gordon regarding to the impact of current Enron stock price on the Raptor structure.  Here are the main points:

1) After the March  fix-up, Raptor hedged ENE credit capacity all the way down to ENE $20/share.  And the collars are consists of European type options.  The maturities are:  original collars for Raptor I, II, IV will mature in 2003.  The new collars for Raptor II and IV will mature in 2005.  

2) The collars were transacted with ENE.

3) The option settling method will be equity method.  Enron will hand over shares at the maturity.  But there is a maximum 3 share per option limit.   For example:   With a strike of $80,  if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares.   But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.

4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.

5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM.  Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.

6) While the raptors have hedged Enron's credit capacities,  the current Enron credit capacity dropped from around ($36MM) after the fix up, to around ($237MM) as of 8/20/01.

Hope these information help answering some of the question you had.

Ding.

We are working on the JCC project with the crude desk (Vasant
Shanbhogue and Nelson Neal are involved in the project).
We are meeting with Marc de la Roche tomorrow to present
our findings about pricing and hedging.

We shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over
the phone.

Vince

P.S. You are right. The margins are fat. It looks like a great opportunity.

Another JCC possibility as well.  

I don't know if you have looked too closely at the MS price sheet that I sent over the other day, but we calculate, based on Enron's curves, that they are earning upwards of USD .50/bbl.  Clearly the effects of little competition.

Seiko Epson Tohoku is semi-conductor factory in Japan, They purchase 38,000KL/Year  kerosene based on JCC + fixed Premium Cost. If they can enter Financial Swap based JCC with us, they can make perfect hedge for the volatility.  

1. Method : Financial Swap (Settled monthly) Enron sell the swap to 
2. Index    : JCC in Japanese Yen
3. Volume : 3,167KL / Month (19,918 Barrel /  Month)

We have received yet another acceptance - Noah Jacobs has accepted our offer as a summer associate.  We are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers.  I have sent Paul Kasper, our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking in on him next week.  Also Eric Cope, a Stanford student that Vince Kaminski's group had interviewed here in Houston for a summer associate position has also accepted.  All in all our Stanford numbers are looking great!

Many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work!

	Since you will not be able to attend the first meeting, I would like
to arrange a visit by you to the Bauer College sometime in the near future,
at your convenience. In this visit, we would like to summarize the
proceedings of the first meeting, get further input from you, and also show
you the recently completed AIM Trading Center (even prior to the official
opening ceremony in January).   It would be great if we could entertain you
for lunch as part of the visit. Please let me know of some days/time-slots
that are open to you in the next couple of weeks, and we will try and firm
up the visit. Many thanks again.


Best wishes,

Our MBA for Executives Program is not included in the recent Financial Times
rankings because we are too young. The Financial Times surveyed alumni from
1998. Our first EMBA class graduated in 2000.

Dean Gil Whitaker was featured in the global business edition of the October
29 issue of Time magazine where he was identified as a "World Beater: People
to Watch in International Business." Whitaker was chosen for his efforts to
diversify the school and pictured with a number of black, Hispanic and women
students. The entire article and photos will be posted on the website soon.

John Campbell, Chief Executive Officer of H-E-B's Central Market, will be
the Dean's Lecture Series featured speaker Wednesday, November 28, from 9:45
to 11:15 a.m., Herring Hall. Campbell, who began his career as a store
checker at H-E-B 30 years ago, led the way to create the premier fresh-food
emporium for people who love food. After years of witnessing customers armed
with coolers driving hundreds of miles to the first Austin location, H-E-B
has expanded the Central Market concept with an additional store in Austin,
one in San Antonio, and another in Houston, which opened May 2001.

Joe,

I sent you another msg about our work on JCC. We are meeting Marc de la Roche tomorrow
to discuss the JCC projects.

Who is the person in Tokyo we should work with on this project?

Vince,

Nothing like a real deal to focus our thoughts on JCC.  JA Aichi is an agricultural association that purchases over 200,000kl per year of Heavy A.  They would like Enron to price a JCC swap (our offer) that would help them manage their Oct 2001 to Mar 02 position as given below.  I'd like to see what we could offer given the volumes and term.  We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.

It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.

Let me know if you need additional info.  I presume that you are fairly far along with evaluation of JCC and that we should be able to derive an offer?  If not, please let me know.  If possible we'd like to send out an offer next week.

thanks.

Joe

Hi, How are you doing ? 

Have received an inquiry form JA Aichi (Different from UNICOOP) in Japan as follows: 

In order to hedge the price of Low Sulphur A, they want to enter the swap based on 
Crude Oil Index or Gas Oil Index, since it has a correlation with the product. 
It would be very appreciated if you could give me a price as following. 

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : Dubai Crude Oil, Platts Singapore Gas Oil Reg. 0.5% 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

Hi Vince, 

Hope things are going well in Houston.  I am presently in Illinois.  It has been pretty hectic.  I will call soon to catch up.  In the mean time, may I request that my leave be extended by another week?  Thanks very much.

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information
regarding this new release..

FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The
accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.
If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible
backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo,
Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional
details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.

@ENERGY (Basics)
European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a
jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options
(see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options
(see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
 Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation
of complex compound options.

If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward
compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and
Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
	@ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed
to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used
in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.

@ENERGY (Basics)
	APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
	No change.

@ENERGY (Weather)
	Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.

@ENERGY (Swing)
	Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all
periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in
beta release.

	Bug fixes:
1)	if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum
daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case).
2)	in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period
changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects).
3)	strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.

New Excel Templates
	The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:

powercalib.xls	examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.

Add-in Manager
Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and
function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the
documentation get displayed.

Your input into the refinement of this product is welcome and greatly
appreciated. Any comments or suggestions may be sent to support@fea.com

Hello Chris,

Thanks for your message.  The first two pages look like an good opening to an article on
a spark spread option.

A few comments.

1. A spark spread model has two primary uses. It can be used for pricing stand alone options
traded in the OTC markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation
model of a generation plant.

Hi Vince,
 
Hope you are well? Les enjoyed his visit with you  very much by the sound of things.
 
I was wondering if you could have a quick look over  the 2 pages attached. Robin is looking for something in the next day or so and  this is as far as I've got today. The article is going to be on spark spread  options. The material attached is the opening blurb - we'll add some analysis  under different models tomorrow - I just wanted to make sure you are comfortable  with the general comments we had written so far. If you want to add anything  then that would be great - pls feel free to add a few points that we can expand  on.
 
Thanks a lot. Its a shame you can't be here for the  Risk conference in a few weeks, we could have had a reunion dinner!
 
Best regards.
 
Chris.

Vince,

As you meet with employees one-on-one tomorrow, you will want to cover a few items with them.  These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:

have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.)
have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date.
Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement.
Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean.
In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.
 

Khymberly and I will both be in your meeting tomorrow at 3pm.

Thanks,
Shanna

Hi, Vince:

We are considering a preliminary list of speakers for Rice/Enron Seminar Series in Finance for Fall 2001 and Spring 2002.  Do you have any persons in mind that you and your group want to include in the list?  Finance faculty will meet to finalize the list later.

Thanks,

Albert

P.S.: Is Ronnie Chahal still around?  She is currently in my Enron distribution list with email address: rchahal@ess.enron.com.  I have received an error message indicating a failure of delivering email to her address.

Jinbaek,

There is still an error in the definition of
the bid-offer spread.

Can you look into it? I have sent it already 
to Greg Whalley, my boss, before I caught it.

How are you doing?
Attached is the summary of yesterday's presentation,

I have no idea whom I should circulate this report.
So please circulate this report to whom you think

My PowerPoint  presentation will be on a PC. I shall come early
to test the equipment.

Please give me a few hints:

Please let me know what equipment you will need for your presentation, so it
will be available in the room in advance.  The location has changed to the
18th floor at the Chase Center. I'll forward the address.  All else remains
the same. Thank you.

   Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully,
   this
   has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
   title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.
   If
   you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward
   the
   attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something
   to
   provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
   appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
   needed
   as soon as possible. Please advise.
   Thank you.

      Gayle,

      November 15 presentation is still on my calendar. I shall be leaving
      later
      that
      day for our annual  management conference in San Antonio (around 3:30
      p.m.).
      My recollection is that the presentation is from11:30 till 1:00 so I
      should
      have plenty of time to get to the airport.

      Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall
   send
      you
      the title of the presentation  from home tomorrow morning.

      Shirley Crenshaw, my assistant, will send you my bio.

         Vince, I want to be sure the Houston Energy Group is still on your
         calendar
         for Wed, Nov 14.  The National Association of Credit Managers
   (NACM)

      other
         industries to attend your session.  I certainly would like to do
   so.

         Can you send me the title of your presentation to be included in
   the
         meeting
         notices?  It would also be helpful if you could send me a bio, so

On other matters, I wonder if your firm would be interested in hiring some
of our very outstanding finance grads. We have an undergraduate, MBA, M.Sc.
and Ph.D. program. I could provide you with more information if you would
like.

all the best

Hi Vince,

During our chat at the Texas Finance Festival you spoke of the need to hire
technically competent yet creative individuals. I know of someone you might
be interested in.

We run an M.Sc. program in Finance at UBC. One of our graduates came into
our program with a Ph.D in physics and went on to be one of our top
graduates. He spent his summer at the Bank of Canada and they hired him upon
graduation. He is currently in their Calgary office. I happened to be
corresponding with him recently and he mentioned that he would like to leave
the Bank but stay in Calgary. I thought of Enron as a possibility and
wondered if you thought there would be some interest. I think he would make
an outstanding contribution to any firm he worked for.

I hope you don't mind this imposition but I didn't want potential gains from
trade to pass by. If you are interested, please let me know.

Hope all is well with you.

Cheers
ron

==========On the McKinsey Quarterly Web site this month==========

What happened to the bull market?
By the time NASDAQ had maxed out in the recent bull market, many financial
commentators were claiming that something structural had changed in the
economy: new economics and the increasing value of intangible assets and
brands, among other things, were supposed to have replaced more
traditional factors in determining stock market valuations. Nice in
theory, perhaps, but wrong in practice. McKinsey analysis shows that the
traditional triumvirate of earnings growth, inflation, and interest rates
continues to drive stock prices.

Broadband media: Look before you leap
How long will it be before broadband for consumers revolutionizes
television and video entertainment? After all, some 40 million households
in the United States will gain access to broadband during the next three
to five years. But broadcasters and other programmers would do well to
temper their enthusiasm, at least for now: the time isn't right to invest
heavily in broadband programming.
http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1100&nlink=22

Brains abroad
Where does global talent go when opportunities aren't sufficiently
plentiful at home? To the United States, of course. In the 1990s alone,
some 650,000 people from emerging markets migrated there on
professional-employment visas. This talent drain could have lasting
economic repercussions for the developing world, depriving it not only of
the skills of these workers but also of their beneficial effects on the
productivity of others.
http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1101&nlink=23

Better UK productivity: An inside job
There is little debate that Britain's manufacturing sector is in decline
but less consensus about the reasons for it. A recent McKinsey study makes
clear that the problem isn't the quality of the country's workforce:
foreign-owned companies in Britain, drawing from the same pool of
frontline labor as their British-owned competitors, are achieving much
higher levels of productivity. The fault instead lies with British
manufacturing companies that have failed to adopt practices proved
elsewhere.

Good Morning, Vince!
 
I spoke with Iris last week about something she had submitted to you.  It's about the various models that we've created in the department.  She said that it goes into details we may not want to publicize, but that it might be adaptable for the newsletter.  There's an introductory section, a models section, and recommendations for the future.  I would suggest that we run the introduction, amend the models section to eliminate anything we don't want to say, and omit the final portion.
 
If you are agreeable, I can use all or part of the introduction in today's issue and split up the rest.  It would give us a breather while others are finishing their submissions.  
 
What do you think?
 
Sam

I got your fax.

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business
hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing
sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs
and references to LTCM and MG. I am afraid they can be taken out
of context and misinterpreted.

Thanks

Dear All,
My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi. I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article "The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives" and he had mailed me the copy.
I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper "Making the most of mean reversion" to estimate the mean reversion speed. I use Queensland half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations. 
However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept. The coefficient and standard error are as followed:
Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076)
Slope: 0.1171 (0.0022)
R Square: 0.0585
Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign. I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same. It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter.
Kindest regards,

Michael,

We would be happy to put them on our mailing list of the GMM and send them the final electronic version of the presentation with the scenarios.  Due to the critical nature of Argentina we are monitoring it on a weekly basis in the GMM.  Do you think it would be useful to provide regional updates on some regular basis, eg.on a quarterly basis or more frequently for Argentina.

We need to get you more active in our activity. I do not think everyone knows your team exists. Put John Lavoratto, louise kitchens and Jim Hughes, stan horton  on you e mail list at least. I would reccomend you set a meeting up with them directly to let them know what your team is doing. I will talk to them again today.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Today's focus: Super-secret Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network Associates is teaming up with the National Security Agency,
the government's top electronic cryptography and spying institution,
to help the agency fine-tune its highly secure version of Linux. The
goal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside
attacks.

Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development
by the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more
secure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from
software vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security
division of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the
Linux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or
PC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating
system. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off
"buffer overrun" and "format string" attacks, which take advantage of
loose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating
system and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed "Lion" was recently
identified as using this method to hack Linux servers.

NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses
in the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux
project to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type
Enforcement protects the operating system and applications by
segmenting them into security "domains" with specifications on what
types of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this
could be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an
application, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with
VMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for
allowing users with different security access to work on the same
server.

The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives
is that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once
finished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include
SELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more
bulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.

Hi, Vince
I hope everything is fine with you. I am following the news and issues about Enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the Chairman will stir the company into the right direction. 
I mentioned to you that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took. Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that I am committed to the task at hand. 
The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at Andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call.
I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.
Sincerely,
Yvan

Hi Vince.

We really feel that there could be enormous benefit to your presenting at the SMS conference.
So few people are actually using real options in practice and we feel that the topic is critical in these uncertain times.
I am very happy to cover the conference costs out of my Chair budget - that is what the Chair is for!

This is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for PROS.
It seems that the system they develop for Williams

Subject:	Re: Hello


Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Vince,

I hope your day is going well.  We seem to have temporarily run out of new people to feature.  Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  I think that in the future, I would like to feature Tanya's daughter Sofya, and also perhaps see if we can cover some people in our offices overseas.  If they can produce the photographs over there, it should be workable. 

Until then, would you like to contribute?

Thank You!

Sam

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

My name is Hee Jung Sim who is working with Dr. Deng.
At first, I thank you so much for your listening to my poor
presentation.
During the presentation, you gave me so valuable comments.
Based on your advice, I am separating my work: 1) modeling the
fundamental underlying (such as the internet usage) and 2) valuing
telecommunication service contracts from the point of view of maximizing
the profit of a capacity
owner/broker.
Though I understand you are so busy, I would like to keep contacting
with you.
Again, I appreciate your time and comments.

Sincerely,

Hee Jung Sim

Sheridan,

I am going out to lunch with Rick Buy today and will
mention the valuation seminar. 
I shall ask Rick how many employees from his
group he would send to this program.

I have no suggestions regarding the program,
except that the last year selection of topics
was very interesting. You can include e-bus
and on-line trading as the topics for 2002.


My address is:

1400 Smith
Houston, TX 77002 - 7361

Vince:

Ehud and I will meet tomorrow to start sketching out the February
conference.  Let me know if you have any strong opinions of issues that you
think we should discuss.  Ehud will write a formal letter to Skilling
inviting him to the conference.

When we have the opportunity, I would like to have a discussion with you
about what the people at Enron think they understand and do not understand
about valuation.  Also, do you think it is an advantage that you are doing
business with relatively naive financial institutions or a disadvantage?

I'm thinking that it might make sense to run a one or two day executive
program on valuation which would include participants from energy companies
and financial institutions.  Let me know if you think you could get support
for this at Enron?

By the way, I still need a name and address to send my check back.  I think
Shirley can take care of it.

Thanks,

regards,

Sheridan

confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
Ehud

Dear Vince and Christie,

 

I hope that you are both well, and are ready for the onset of summer in Houston!  I was disappointed that I was not able to see you at the final Tiger Team presentations last month due to a family emergency.  I hope that the teams' analyses will be helpful to your work, and echo their appreciation of your involvement and support.

 

I am writing with a question regarding recruiting for Enron's weather risk management group.  My boyfriend, Greg Hunt, is currently seeking opportunities to combine his background in meteorology (MS and 2 years of research at Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab) and an MBA in finance and information technology.  I began thinking about Enron's work in weather derivatives, and realized that there could possibly be a great fit there.

 

I have copied Greg on this message, and would appreciate any suggestions you can offer regarding opportunities in this group.  Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,

 

Heather

Tom, 

The attached C routine is a HJM forward curve modeling module in the storage model.

Jim,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Vince

Vince,

In the morning we were talking about the El Paso candidate who thinks he is above something and is not
willing to take certain project or responsibility.   In real life, we also occasionally have similar stiuation. (an
example is attached).

I would like to have your guidance when such a situation occurs.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Gentlemen:
	Lance did a very good job last Friday presenting
his ERCOT work to the people here at the University of 
California Energy Institute.
	Severin Borenstein invited us to put the paper on
the UCEI website as a POWER working paper when we get it
finished.  I think this would be a very good idea.
What do you think?  Of course, we can (simultaneously)
submit it for publication to IEEE PES.

Importance:	High


Hi Mark,

	
  	This email is in reference to our meeting today regarding the following issues:
		1.  Meeting with Mark Braemer (??) to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models (to be released this summer).
		2.  Your willingness to let us use some of your data (in files on the 6th floor) to experiment with Moody's RiskCalc.

	In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process - especially the subjective component.  Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties.

	Also, thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the 6th floor.  We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down.

 
	More specifically, to evaluate Moody's RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enron's North American (private firm) counterparties:

		
 	
Fiscal Year
The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year's (1999) inflation level. In general this 'estimation error' will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not). 

Cash & Equivalents
This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities. 

Inventory
Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.

Current Assets
This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets. 

Total Assets
Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous year's total assets blank for Australian companies. 

Current Liabilities
Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 


Total Liabilities
This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest). 


Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income. 

Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities. 


Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian companies. 



Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for Australian companies. 


Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia. 





Thanks for your assistance,
Iris

Subject:	Boltzmann Model Demonstration from Toshiba in Tokyo
Importance:	High

Vince,

Enron Japan received a presentation today from a nuclear physicist working for Toshiba who has developed an application of the Boltzmann model to finance.  We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Group's Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html

Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.

Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 

Regards,
Mark Brady

Dear Vincent,

I have to say sorry for disturbing your valuable time but I really need your
help.

My name is Visit Phunnarungsi. I am now taking Master of Banking & Finance
at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia.

In this last semester, I am writing the thesis about the electricity
derivatives and found that you are very expert in this area. I found your
name in the article: The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity
Derivatives" The US Power Market, 149-171. Risk Publications (1997)

However, I could not found the Risk Publications (1997) available in the
library of Australia University.  There is only 1995 publications.

It would be appreciated if you are possible sending it to me electronically
as I would like to do theoretically review of this article for my thesis. Or
please advice any source that I can found this article.

Thank you very much.

Kindest Regards,
Visit

Boston for the Risk 2001 conference?
Development is moving along at a good pace here at Opt4.
Best regards,
Bill Balson

Gina,

I was thinking about calling you and suggesting an "Italian only"
lunch. I can also introduce you to my associate, Rakesh Bharati,
who studies Italian on his own.

What about Tuesday next week?

Vince, I will certainly try. I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh. Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not. The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no. Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse.

But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai.

Subject:	Help for Krishnarao Pinnamaneni

Wade,

I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who
faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna
from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.

A brief outline of the facts.

1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years
ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival
was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy
is also very complicated.

2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a 
tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the
term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with
the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.

The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an 
outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American 
society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his 
behalf to the State Department.

I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational
approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.

I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's
behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. 
I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.

Thanks.

Vince

Vince, 

EBS has sponsored a $3500 table at the FRIEND level.  You could either do that, or you could do a $1000 table at the MEMBER level --- Enron is already a corporate member.  Either table provides for an acknowledgment in the program.

The $1000 table provides for 10 people, whereas the $3500 table provides seating for 8 people from our side plus 2 student interns placed by IACCGH at local companies will also sit at our table.

Either table would be great (I would not go any higher).  I guess the only difference would be distance of table from the front.

Thanks,
Vasant

Hi Vince,

	Chitra wanted me to check with you to see if you (Enron Research) would be interested in sponsoring a table at the annual gala dinner with the Consul General, and the Indian Ambassador.  People associated with India projects (Sandeep, Krishna, etc) may benefit.  Of course, if you are sponsoring, I would like to be invited.  

	EBS is sponsoring one table, and that is the only Enron participation so far.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you for your email concerning my paper on EVT and VaR.
I have thought about your question:

If you take formula (2.8) and plug in the parameters (u=10, N_u=56, beta=11.120
chi=0.186, q=0.95, n=108) you get hat(x)=42.86 DM.
Now we only have to explain the minus:
If you look at figure 3, you see that we considered the absolute negative
returns, i.e. we neglected the minus sign of these returns. but in the DRC we
have to pay attention on the minus sign, since we consider returns, not only
absolute returns. this is the reason for the minus in equation (3.10).

I hope I could help you with this explanation.

If you have further questions don't hesitate to ask me.

Sincerely,

Susanne Emmer

Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak
at this conference? Our friends at UT were very disappointed last
time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should
try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

Hi Vincent:
 
Super Saturday is coming and I am so happy to move toward the end of the recruiting process.  During the interviews that I have had so far, I expressed my desire to have my first rotation in your group.  Last spring I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I met.  I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.


Vince

We have backup tapes for deleted email.  David Cohen is aware of this and in fact we are following Wilmer Cutler's advice on all of these issues.  Britt's message is in response to a recently-received subpoena and is a precaution until we can speak with the Wilmer lawyers.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

	It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
	30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
	of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
	who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee),

	I hope you can look into.

Dear Energy Supply/Power Marketing Executive:
 
A letter by Thomas R. Kuhn, President of the Edison Electric Institute, was  published by the Wall Street Journal 12/13/01.  Written in response to  "Shock Waves:  Enron's Swoon Leaves a Grand Experiment in a State of  Disarray" (11/30/01), Mr. Kuhn's letter underscored the strength  demonstrated by competitive U.S. energy markets in light of Enron's  financial crisis.  Attached is a copy of this letter.

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I am sorry for this lateness.
I was in Seattle during the last a few days and came back to Atlanta
yesterday.
This coming winter break (Dec. 14 - Jan. 2), I am planning to go back to
my country to spend some time with my family. While I am staying there, I
would like to collect as much as information possible in the internet
traffic area. There are a lot of research going on in Korean
Universities, so I can get clearer idea in my language which can shorten
my research time.
I will call you when I come back to U.S.
Thank you.

Sincerely,

Hee Jung Sim

Subject:	Re: Hello

Vince, thanks for your update. I am sorry hear that the people in your group
will be affected as well.

Please keep me in the loop as you get time to work on your future
activities.

One of the areas where I would like to creat a new business line is in
Enterprise Cash flow analysis.

It will be a software (middleware) play that will link up with existing
financial tools to assess and manage cash delta to various exposures
(commodity price, volume, weather, interest rate & spread, FX, etc...).
There are plenty of tools out there claiming to do this but I don't think
they have the risk management and financial analysis background to build an
effective tool. Also, without consulting support going along with it the
client would not be able to assess the exposure.  It can provide reliability
analysis type of drill down from what can go wrong to simulation of down
grade events, etc...

The tool could be used to host a site where publically traded company's
financial information can be extracted out of EDGAR and Cash flow risk
indicator can be publihsed....

I am thinking that there must be a grant (matching based on a company
seeding this activity) that could be used to do the initial development. It
could come from SEC, AIMR, FAS, etc...  I know there are plenty of cash flow
at risk (CAR) and profit at risk (PAR) tools out there but I think I can
take that old concept and deliver the product that is useful and provides
relevant information.  The presentation of the software is as important as
its functionality.  Quicken came up with its product, which was not that new
but it worked and easy to use.....

The resources I am talking about is myself and a software programer to start
with and adding another junior analyst later.



Let me know if I am missing something here.

Hello,

Thanks for your message. I think that we can resume our discussions in a few
months. We have currently a large group of highly skilled Enron employees
who, given that we have effectively an internal labor market, are looking for alternative
positions. We are giving them a priority in the hiring decisions.

I really like setting things up and seeing the results
come together quickly and efficiently.  

I am a quick learner and a willing learner and feel that
I would be able to assist you a great deal with the Estate.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Foresight.

Joe, 

Attached is the business case summary we discussed earlier today for
your review and assistance with contacting Enron Principal Investments. 
Please keep the document under tight control as all information is
strictly confidential.

The business case is primarily built around the model of Foresight
becoming an integrated weather service provider.  However, we are very
interested and aggressively pursuing the option of forming an exclusive
partnership with an energy/trading firm.

Please review and contact me via email or at one of the numbers below

Subject:	ALLIANCE FERC ALERT: Status Report on Interconnection     Agreement and Procedures & Extension Request


Attached is the status report and motion for extension of time filed on  Friday, December 14 by the Generator Interconnection Coalition drafting  committee. This group is the smaller subset of the larger industry-wide plenary  group formed as a result of the FERC's directive to convene an Interconnection  conference to develop a consensus Interconnection Agreement and Procedures  document that all of industry would adopt. 
As the industry plenary  session yielded as much results as could be expected in a large group setting,  the drafting committees were formed of Generators, Transmission Owners,  Transmission Dependent Utilities, and ISO/RTOs. A committee was formed for both  the drafting of the Interconnection Agreement and Procedures documents. Many of  your companies are represented on one of these committees. 
Because the  FERC set a December 14 filing due date for a final consensus interconnection  document, we filed for an extension of time to complete the drafting process and  finalize the documents for FERC consideration. No one entity has endorsed the  document in its entirety, because drafting and negotiations are still underway.  Since the larger plenary had not had an opportunity to review the documents and  be provided a walk-through by the drafters, the request for an extension until  January 11, 2002 for which to file a final comprehensive consensus  Interconnection document was made. In addition, we filed for extension of the  ANOPR comments due date which was initially set for December 21, but has been  extended until January 25. This will allow for the larger plenary group to  reconvene the week of January 14 at FERC for a two-day session to discuss the  final workproduct. 
A notice designating the dates and times of this plenary  session will be provided at a later date. 
Anticipating our  filing of the status report and motion for extension, FERC granted both requests  for extensions to file. Attached are the status report, motions and notice  granting extension.

Today's focus: Panda: Virus authors getting trickier

By Jason Meserve


I got a couple of interesting items in my inbox this week. The
first was an antivirus vendor press release doing the annual
look-back-at-last-year and look-forward-to-this-year pitch.

The Panda Software release says virus authors are getting more
tricky in their attempts to spread viruses, using social
engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open their
malicious wares. Panda is hoping that 2002 will not be a repeat
of 2001, when a number of simple "bait" messages caused mass
mailing viruses to spread like wildfire.

Panda also suspects that viruses in 2002 will go after known
system exploits like buffer overflows to run code on infected
machines. Users are urged to keep systems and antivirus
software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Sounds
like common sense to me. For more, go to:
http://www.pandasoftware.com/

The second item was an e-mail alert sent around by the authors
of the SiliconValley.com newsletter warning that their systems
had been hacked and used to send messages infected with
Magistr.B virus. Not good when a major media outlet's systems
are hacked and used to attack unsuspecting readers. Let's hope
Network World's systems never suffer such a fate.


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* More mutt updates available from Linux vendors

A buffer overflow in mutt's e-mail address parser could be
exploited by a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary bytes in
memory. Red Hat users can download new versions of mutt from:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-003.html

Linux-Mandrake users can get more from:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-002.php

Conectiva users:

* Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router vulnerability

According to an alert from Cisco, three vulnerabilities have
been discovered in Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router software
releases up to and including 1.1(5). Two of the vulnerabilities
can cause a denial-of-service attack. The other allows access
to the SN 5420 configuration if it has been previously saved on
the router. There is no workaround for these vulnerabilities.
For more, go to:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/SN-multiple-pub.shtml


* SGI reports NQE vulnerability

The Network Queuing Environment (NQE) that shipped in the past
with SGI contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow
vulnerability that could lead to a malicious user gaining root
access. SGI considers this product retired and will not be
releasing a patch for the problem. For more, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20020101-01-I


* Sun releases patch for CDE Subprocess Control Service

A buffer overflow flaw in the CDE Subprocess Control Service
(dtspcd) daemon could be exploited by a malicious user to gain
root access on the affected system. Sun users can download the
appropriate patch from:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/securitypatch


* Debian patches libgtop

Two flaws in the libgtop daemon could allow a malicious user to
gain privileges of the application, usually those for the
"nobody" user. Debian users can get more information and
patches from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-098


* Microsoft investigating alleged flaw in IE browser

Microsoft said it's investigating an alleged flaw in recent
versions of its Internet Explorer browser software that could
allow attackers to spoof legitimate Web sites, steal content
from browser cookies and gain access to certain types of files
on a victim's system.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108ieflaw.html
Computerworld, 01/08/02


* Linux-Mandrake updates BIND

Previous versions of BIND 9.x that shipped with Linux-Mandrake
8.0 and 8.1 contain insecure permissions, configuration files
and executables. This new release tightens things up a bit. For
more, go to:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-001.php


* Red Hat fixes exim

A flaw in the way exim handles some incoming data could expose
the affected system to arbitrary malicious code. For more, go
to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-176.html


* Patch available for stunnel

Red Hat has released a patch for stunnel to fix a format string
vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code
on the affected system. For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-002.html


* Conectiva patches proftpd

Two vulnerabilities in proftpd could allow a malicious user to
bypass some security features or launch a denial-of-service
attack against the affected machine. For more, go to:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000450


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* First virus identified that infects Shockwave Flash files

Antivirus software vendors say they have spotted the first
computer virus that uses Macromedia's Shockwave Flash files to
transmit itself once a victim clicks to run the Flash movie.
Identified as SWF/LFM-926 by antivirus software vendor Sophos,
this virus is not yet "in the wild," infecting computers. The
Shockwave Flash virus was sent to Sophos as a sample via
anonymous e-mail, and this specimen is now being shared and
analyzed among several antivirus vendors.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108flashvirus.html
Network World, 01/08/02

* XM97/Bdoc2-A - An Excel macro virus that displays a message
on April 26 and attempts to shut down the current Windows
session if the day is a multiple of 5. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AX - A Word macro virus that changes user summary
information in the infected document. It also makes changes to
the autoexec.bat file to display a Happy Birthday message on
certain days of the year. (Sophos)

* W32.Donut - A virus only Homer Simpson could love. Symantec
reports this is a concept virus designed to test potential
weaknesses in Microsoft's .Net architecture. (Symantec)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Suggested fix for AIM hole has back door, spyware

Software recommended by security group w00w00 to plug a hole in
AOL's Instant Messenger opens the user's system to hacker

U.S. computer systems are increasingly vulnerable to
cyberattacks, partly because companies are not implementing
security measures already available, according to a new report
released Tuesday.

* Secure IM software proliferates

The market for secure, business-grade instant messaging
software is picking up steam, with several start-ups now
offering packages that automatically encrypt real-time chat
sessions between users. However, these packages do not yet
offer secure communications with users of popular consumer-
oriented IM systems from AOL, Microsoft and others.

Vince-

Are you guys still working on that "project" to provide content via EOL?
The reason I'm asking is we have developed a particular technology to
deliver fundamentals data via web-based applets, and we could probably
talk to the vendor about a larger license to permit its dissemination
this way. There would have to be disclaimers, and it might not work
because of the liability, but I did want to let you know we have a neat
technology to permit people to visualize data. Let me know if you want
to talk about it.

I interviewed this fellow, who I understood worked for EES last year, and I found him to be very competent and the Economics Chairman thinks he walks on water.  He interviewed for a spot in Gas Load Forecasting but Shawn Chmil is passing on him due to lack of actual experience in load forecasting.

If anyone needs a very bright (top of the class) economics/stat candidate then please call me, ext 39464.

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
In early July, the EIM Fundamentals Siebel Team launched Siebel Episode II: Siebel Express Enhancements.  Siebel Episode II added a number of new fields and views to the Siebel database, which is currently available to each of the over 150 traders, originators and senior management at EIM. Siebel provides these users with the ability to store all of their accounts, contacts, potential deals and activities in a common, shared repository.  In early August, Enron Freight Markets will follow EIM's lead and launch Siebel Episode II to their front-office personnel.  

Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, in collaboration with Enron Net Works, recently executed a two-year agreement with SkyTel Communications, Inc. to provide users with one- and two-way local and nationwide numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.

Under this agreement, Enron will also receive special discount incentives including, 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases through year-end 2001, trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units through year-end 2001, upload and download of contact lists from select pc-compatible hardware to new RIM devices, customized training for hardware and services featured quarterly, and monthly service costs that will be billed at 50% of normal rates for a limited time.

Personal toll free numbers, personal voice mail, operator dispatched text messages, pin-to-pin messaging and text-to-voice and text-to-fax service options will be available on select devices, including Motorola T900 and P935.

EA-Office of the Chairman
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described here.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.


IN THE NEWS

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp., EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.

The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursing mergers or acquisition for now, according to Greg Piper.


UNITED WAY 2001
United Way Campaign:  Stay tuned...Enron kicks-off the company-wide United Way campaign on Monday, August 6.  It ends Friday, August 17.  EWS is shooting for 100% participation in this year's on-line campaign.   
Days of Caring: The United Way "Days of Caring" are August 6-10. Volunteers are rapidly signing up for the EWS day scheduled for August 10. The 2001 theme is "Building Houston's Future" and EWS is sponsoring the Center for the Retarded.  There is a competition between the four Enron companies; EWS, Enron Corp., ETS, and EES to see which one provides the most volunteers.  Sign up and receive your Day of Caring T-shirt at the Infozone located in the Enron Building Plaza from July 30 to August 3.
Everyone in EWS who participates in the Days of Caring will have their name entered into a drawing to win one of five American Express Gift Certificates.
To volunteer: 
Online registration:  http://cr.enron.com/cr-cgi-bin/view_volops.pl  
Or contact an EWS Days of Caring Committee Member:

Julie Clyatt at ext. 3-3256;  Cheryl Lindeman at ext. 5-2849; Tom Myers at ext. 3-0475; Tammie 
Schoppe at ext.3-4220;  Philip Conn at ext. 5-8181; Marcus Edmonds at ext. 3-4243;  Marilyn 
Oliver at ext. 5-6122    

Day of Caring Volunteer Information
Transportation:  Shuttles will be provided for all projects if needed.  Loading and unloading of buses will be on Ruthvan street, between the Enron Building and the Continental Building.  Morning shifts will leave at 8:15am and return to Enron at 11:30am.  Afternoon shifts will leave at 1:00pm and return at 4:00pm.

Food:  Doughnuts and juice will be available to all morning volunteers.  Enron will also provide boxed lunches at noon at the Enron building. For those volunteers staying all day at their site, we will send lunches on the 1:00pm bus.  

Water:  Water and ice will be provided at the Enron Building before the buses leave.  Volunteers are encouraged to bring coolers from home to load water.

T-shirts:  T-shirts can be picked up at EB1638e.  T-shirts will also be available while loading the busses.

Materials:  Enron and United Way will provide any materials needed for your project.  (i.e. paint, brushes, dirt, plants, books, etc).  Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own gloves and other items for their comfort (i.e. paint shirts, caps, bug spray, sunscreen, kneeling pads, etc).  Talk to your site leader to find out about other tools that are needed.

Showers:  Enron's Body Shop has provided showers for all Day of Caring volunteers.  Waivers will be available on the bus ride to the Enron Building.  Wear your shirt and sign in at the registration desk at The Body Shop.

United Way Challenge:  To compete against the other business units, EWS must create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  The primary building material will be Legos.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit childcare centers.
On Friday, August 10 at 11:00 am, the teams will meet to begin construction and they have 45 minutes to complete their model of Enron's attributes.  At 12:00 pm, Ken Lay will host the judging competition with the winner decided using "The Applause Meter."
Each team must consist of 7 to 10 members from their business unit and must have at least 3 executives (i.e., Directors or above).  The model must be freestanding.  And, although Legos will be provided as the primary building tool, other materials may be used, so use your imagination.
Please call or e-mail Julie Clyatt if you are interested in participating.  She can be reached at ext. 3-3256.

PoweRisk 2001

The Global Premier ForumforEnergy Trading & Risk  Management

 6th - 9th November  2001, Paris

 
Dear Mr Kaminski, 
 
I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again this year - brilliant!
 
I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.  
 
To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical") topics that are already covered:
 


Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of Exotic Energy  Contracts

multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts 
adding jumps 
applying the models to  exotic energy options 
extensions to multiple  energy contracts 

Les  Clewlow: Valuation and Risk Management of Virtual Power Stations and Gas  Supply Agreements

Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA) 
Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS) 
Valuation  methods for GSA's and VPS's 
Risk Analysis of GSA's  and VPS's

 

Derek Bunn, Professor of Decision  Sciences, LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL: Analysing The Impact Of NETA On  Market Efficiency & Volatility In The UK Energy  Market
 

Chris Harris,  Director of Market Development.Operations and Engineering, INNOGY: Applying  Cutting-Edge Portfolio Management Theory In Order To Optimise Your Risk Exposure  

Establishing  and valuing the key factors using a bottom up approach 
Looking at  the interconnection between key factors 
The treatment of the risk  of infrequent but high impact events

Peter  Nance, Principal, TEKNECON: Combining Power  Systems And Monte Carlo Simulations For Effective  Pricing

Dan  Mansfeld, Head of Risk  Control,  VATTENFALL:  Assessing The Benefits And Risks Of Using  Derivatives As Part Of Your Risk Management Strategy

Spyros  Maragos: Analysing New Approaches To Building Forward Curves From Available  Market Data 

Tamara  Weinert, Credit and Contracts  Manager, MIRANT  ENERGY: Successfully Measuring & Managing Credit  Risk

What is  Credit Risk? 
Major changes  in the industry and their impact on Credit Risk 
Effects of  new risk profiles on credit appetite: Credit analysis; Limit Setting; Risk  Reducing Structures 
Importance of Credit in  the Organizational Structure: Reporting; Dependence; Structure of Credit  Department

Brett  Humphreys: Examining Cutting-Edge Credit Exposure Mitigation Tools: Combining  Counterparty and Portfolio Credit VaR Techniques

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured  contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001 speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)  would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has not been covered  yet.
 
I look forward to hearing  from you, 
 
Kind Regards,  
Angelika  Staude

Thanks. I have forwarded your message to Mark Palmer, our
press spokesman. He has a full plate, as you might expect,
but I strongly suggested  that he should get in touch with you.

Vince,

Thanks for your comments. I will adapt the memo to our clients to make it
more neutral.

I find myself in an interesting position -- you may recall meeting one of my
associates during one of our DC seminars that you attended. He is now
working for Larry Lindsay at the White House and I was with him on Friday.

He asked for my views on the situation and I demurred, saying I did not have
enough information to make an informed estimate of whether this might turn
into an energy equivalent of LTCM (the MG situation was quite different in
its structural aspects).

Anyway, I am trying to be helpful here... I realize your company can call DC
any time and present the situation but it may be useful to have someone like
me as a side channel.

If I can be useful in this channel let me know.

All the best.

Ed

Ed,

I got your fax.

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business
hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing
sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs
and references to LTCM and MG. I am afraid they can be taken out
of context and misinterpreted.

Thanks

Vince-

Good news. Martin's box is working wonderfully- I'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday.

This was (another) nice deal for Enron. We save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server, using a box that wasn't being used by anyone. I'm happy about this.

good morning,  strong open today. You can buy your NEM and  AU. However, I will be glad to debate the point of whether inflation will be a problem for the foreseeable future.

Buy ATSN and ACTU on open

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

I will also send it to Maureen and Gwen to see if they are interested.

Dear Ms. Magee:
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you at the NSHMBA Career Fair in San Antonio, Texas and to learn more about employment opportunities at Enron. Our conversation reinforced my desire to join Enron's Associate Program. I am positive that my strong analytical skills, specific knowledge of industry regulation and working experience overseas, particularly in the energy sector would be great assets to your organization. 
 
As I mentioned to you during the conference, through my career and during my MBA studies at the Simon School (University of Rochester) and the London School of Economics (LSE), where I earned a MS in Industry Regulation, I have gained strong analytical skills and an excellent understanding of the global trends in the energy sector, especially of those related to the deregulation of the industry. Furthermore, working as an economist at the Vice-Ministry of the Treasury in Bolivia allowed me to gain hands-on experience in quantitative and financial analysis. These experiences have been complemented by my recent summer internship with British Petroleum (BP) Latin America where I was responsible for developing a valuation model to determine the acquisition price of a liquefied petroleum gas distributing company. As a result, I was directly exposed to the extraordinary prospects of the energy sector and to the expectations and needs of energy companies. 
 
My current studies at the Simon School have also helped me further develop my finance and communication skills, which are essential for a position with Enron. I am confident I will be able to contribute positively to your organizations success. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my professional qualifications and personal qualities fit Enron present activities and its plans for the future. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any specific related to my credentials, please do not hesitate to contact me to the following telephone number: (716) 271 0934.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Marcos A. Tapia

Hi, Dr. Kaminski:

   I am Zhendong, the student of Dr. Deng. I think Dr. Deng has sent my
resume to you. I am very happy to have an opportunity to work with you
this summer.
   I am a student in both MS qcf and Ph.d EDA programs in Georgia Tech
now. I plan to find a job in industry instead of academic after my
graduation. So I intend to do internship during the process of prusuing my
degree to acquire some experience for my future career.
   I hope to start on 5/14/2001 and end on 8/17/2001.
   Thanks a lot.

Hi guys,

here is a simple template based on discussions with Vince and Rakesh.  It takes positions for a single commodity (physical and financial), collateral info, and calculates P&L and collateral needs over a one month horizon.

This can be expanded to add pictorial info, and other expenses, and any other details as needed.

This is just a first cut, please feel free to tear it apart as appropriate.

EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002

Dulles, VA -- January 25, 2002-The Energy Information Administration will display its plans for a new weekly natural gas storage survey, as part of an extensive program exploring the wholesale gas and power markets at GasMart/Power 2002, March 18-20 in Reno, NV, hosted by Intelligence Press, Inc.
In a special session Wednesday, March 20, 2002, EIA Senior Analyst Roy Kass will outline the agency's new weekly natural gas storage survey which will replace the current survey conducted by the American Gas Association. Due for release in early May, EIA's survey is expected to become the most critical piece of data informing the market. During the conference, attendees also will be able to visit EIA's Showcase area to see and discuss with its creators, the draft version of the agency's new product.
In other sessions at the 16th annual GasMart/Power forum key natural gas and power representatives will come together to hear about strategies in the current low energy price, high security environment, and --- the impact on the competitive market of the collapse of Enron, the market's largest and most zealous supporter.
Keynoter Richard Sherrill, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Duke Energy North America will assess the state of the wholesale natural gas and power market, offering his strategies for instilling customer confidence in the face of the wrenching market disruptions of the last few years. He also will offer his views as to the market share for electronic trading and the outlook for electric restructuring? 
Energy guru Ben Schlesinger will explore the impact of Enron's collapse on other marketers; on rules and regulations; and on the political scene.  Will Congress intervene to re-control gas and power prices?  How long will energy investors shy away from major commitments?  Are we in for another boom-bust price cycle? Did the skyrocketing energy prices in California and other parts of the nation in the latter half of 2000 and early 2001 carry the seeds of the current bust, weakening industrial customers, bankrupting the largest marketer, and ultimately reversing gains in the competitive market?
In others of the 18 sessions at GasMart/Power 2002, Dynegy Vice President Peter Esposito and Jim Macias, Sr. Vice President of Calpine tell what's ahead for power generation. ?Williams Energy Marketing & Trading President Bill Hobbs and TXU Vice President Jeff Shorter assess the winter...Futures analyst Cynthia Kase instructs on technical market analysis ?
FERC's Shelton Cannon, Deputy Director, Office of Markets, Tariffs & Rates, explores RTO development and the standardization of market design and market rules?Representatives of the California Energy Commission, the Cal-ISO, the Western Power Trading Forum, Bonneville Power Administration and Southern California Gas discuss various aspects of western gas and power markets? 
Gordon Shearer, Poten Partners, and TransCanada Vice President Steve Becker report the latest developments on the LNG and Arctic gas fronts?and Richard Sharples, Senior VP, Marketing & Minerals, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Arthur L. Smith, Chairman & CEO, John S. Herold, Inc. strategize on how to survive for the long haul in E&P. 
The annual GasMart/Power conference is sponsored by Intelligence Press Inc., publisher of the industry's real time, daily and weekly publications, Natural Gas Intelligence, NGI's Daily Gas Price Index, Power Market Today and NGI's Weekly Gas Price Index. Visit intelligencepress.com  to read the news as it's happening.

Vince - Hrvojesuggested that I drop you a note.  I am with an Austin Ventures portfolio company and we may have room for junior research people (1 or 2).  If there are some analysts or associates in your group who would be interested in talking to us and need a home, please feel free to have them call me or send a resume.  We would talk to anyone who can code option pricing formulas.  JAVA skills, or good Object Oriented programming experience and sufficient mathematical background for the FE work are priorities.  Our Chief Architect would like to see some Database understanding, but that is somewhat more flexible.  American options and Swing options are current issues, although any exotics experience is fine.  I would consider contract/part-time if someone would like to take a project while looking for positions with another larger company.
 
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your group.  I wish we had more immediate needs, but perhaps at the margin this can help.
 
Warm Regards,
Ashley

Peter,

Thanks for your words of comfort. The higher you fly, the harder you crash.
Books will be written about this company.

I don't worry too much about myself. I have about fifty employees in
Houston and 10 in London who need help. I am trying to find jobs
for them using my contacts in the industry. 

Personally, I have many options that have come up in the last few days but everything is
on hold for the time being till uncertainty is resolved here  at Enron.

Vince

Dear Vince: hope this reaches you. Just wanted to say how sorry I am about
what's happened to Enron. I hope things work out for you -- I'm sure with
all your brilliance they will. But it's so hard to believe that a company as
revered as Enron can unwind in such a short space of time. It makes you
re-think a lot of assumptions about how companies run and how markets work.

Enron is big news over here. On the main BBC t.v. news last night, Enron was
the third story, after Afghanistan and the memorial service at Westminster
Abbey for the British killed on Sept 11 (which a lot of us attended with the
Bristow, Bennett and other families).

Anyway, please keep in touch.

All the best, Peter

Dear Samantha,

My associate, Steve Leppard, sent me a message about a conversation he had with you 
regarding books on quantitative aspects of trading different commodities.

I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from
a very general introduction to different commodity markets to highly technical treaties) and
about the contribution  Enron could make.

You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, "Managing Energy
Price Risk", 2nd edition. This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published
so far. It is a good starting point to a conversation about different  options you might consider.

Please, feel free to give me a call. My direct number is 713 853 3848.

Remi, Dave:


First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize
for a delay in responding to you. It was quite a tumultuous week
and the turbulence continues.

The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to 
jumpstart the process.

1.	Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee
started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers.
Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.

2.	SDDP. As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week.
They put their grimy fingers on him first.
He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs.
He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help
you with the project.

3.	Transmission modeling. Martin Lin will call Dave to jumpstart the process.

4.	Zimin will call David regarding swing option model, option pricing models
for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.

5.	Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research 
	Remains to be discussed with Jose and Mike.

Here is the message for Jeff:



Jeff,

I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation
at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference
is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).

This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.


Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, 
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the 
agenda for the future.


Vince Kaminski

Rick,

Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak
at this conference? Our friends at UT were very disappointed last
time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should
try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

Vince:

Greetings.

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was.

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public
Affairs Mike Rosen.

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26,
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or
whether you would prefer a subset thereof.

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.:
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters.

Best,
Ehud

Something to brighten your day!  And remember to keep in touch!


******************************************************************************************

Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence.
The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled, gray and dense.

As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go,
The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow.

When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart,
From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.

So Jake did what most of us would do, if we'd have been there.
He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.

As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck.
They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.

Now Jake had been around in life, and done his share of roamin'.
But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'.

Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter.
[Now, this line, it ain't needed but it helps with rhyme and meter.]

So they set and talked a spell or two, or maybe it was three,
Nobody was keeping' score--- in Heaven time is free.

"I've always heard," Jake said to Pete, "that God will answer prayer,
But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there.

Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others?
That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers.

Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason?
Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season.

Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel,
And I was wonderin', could you tell me - what the heck's the deal?"

Peter listened very patiently and when Jake was done,
There were smiles of recognition, and he said, "So, you're the one!

That day your truck wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a flyin',
You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a tryin',

A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file,
But you know, Jake - - - we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.

And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota,
He didn't recognize your voice... and started a truck in South Dakota.

So, remember to keep in touch!

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

    I solved Security problem already.

  More question:
  1.      Where are the things (C and spreadsheets) that generates the forward curves ?
  2.      What else do you think we should have, but have not got yet? Could you forward me the piece of paper that lists all the research sources
          that go to NetCo
  3.      I found the Research Intelligence news letters are very valuable. Can we get them? and How ( I know how to get from the web, I am afraid 
               the web site will be not supported by NetCo).

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Origination
On Friday, June 15, the Development Review Committee for Deerfield Beach, Florida, unanimously approved the 510 megawatt peaking power plant proposed for their city.  This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.

Enron Industrial Markets
On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.  

In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.  

These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
Enron impact takes its toll, FI lenders scrips plunge on bourses, Sharad Mi=
stry & Laxmikant Khanvilkar=20

THREE major financial institutions - ICICI, IDBI and IFCI - are witnessing =
an increased selling wave on the bourses over the past few trading sessions=
, thanks to their collective exposure in the controversial Enron-promoted $=
3 billion Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The total exposure in DPC of these FI=
s, and a few banks like the State Bank of India and Canara Bank, including =
foreign currency guarantees, works out to over Rs 5,500 crore. Little wonde=
r, therefore, that investors fear more red ink splashed over the balance sh=
eets of the FIs and are hurrying to move out of their investments in these =
FIs.=20

The stock prices of all the three FIs have been sliding. While the stock pr=
ice of IDBI and IFCI have touched new lows of Rs 16 and Rs 2.90, respective=
ly, that of ICICI is still holding at around Rs 50-55 levels. Early this mo=
nth, IDBI was quoted at Rs 19.90, IFCI at Rs 3.60 and ICICI at Rs 59.30. IC=
ICI, however, had touched Rs 51 on August 9, a new low from previous levels=
. This clearly indicates that, plagued by the rising share of non-performin=
g loans (NPLs) to total assets of all the three FIs, the share prices of th=
ese FIs have came under severe pressure.=20

Analysts tracking the banking and FI counters say that the sliding trend is=
 feared to be continued over the days and weeks ahead, especially because o=
f the tightening of the non-performing assets guidelines by the Reserve Ban=
k of India (RBI). Moreover, the kind of trading activity witnessed at these=
 counters is alarming. While the volume of share trade is substantial, ther=
e is a sharp fall in the stock prices of these stocks. Quite clearly, these=
 are no good indicators, at least for the time being. However, these compan=
ies disbursal/approvals to DPC are well within the stipulated RBI norms, i.=
e., 15 per cent of total disbursal/ approvals.=20

For example, ICICI's gross NPL as of March 2001, stands at a whopping Rs 5,=
988 crore. Power sector leads the approval and disbural list of ICICI at Rs=
 6,424 crore and Rs 2,400 crore, respectively. Its exposure in the power se=
ctor, which stood at Rs 8,531 crore or 11 per cent of the total exposure of=
 Rs 77,279 crore, has been on the decline. Last year they stood at 11.6 per=
 cent of Rs 65,495 crore. On the other hand, IDBI's stock price is on the s=
lide since the beginning of this month. It is currently quoting at Rs 16. T=
he counter is experiencing heavy volumes with daily volumes being in the ra=
nge of 35,000 plus. The situation is worse for IFCI which is quoting below =
par for quite sometime now. Further, the scrip has been losing steam since =
August 2, when it was quoting at Rs 4. Currently, it is quoting below Rs 3.=

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
FIs initiate search for buyers for Enron stake, Samik Dasgupta & Soma Baner=
jee=20

THE SEARCH for getting a buyer for Enron's equity in the Dabhol power proje=
ct has started with financial institutions initiating discussions with pote=
ntial buyers. FIs have been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing =
a roadmap for Enron's exit and finding a solution to pending MSEB payments.=
 The first job for FIs is to determine the actual cost required to complete=
 the Dabhol project. Although, about 96 per cent of the project is complete=
, the stoppage of work for the past few weeks has led to cancellation of co=
ntracts and possibilities of the cost escalating. With Enron having already=
 announced its unwillingness to pump in additional resources, the new inves=
tor will not only have to pay for the equity but also fund the project's co=
mpletion. Speaking to ET, finance secretary Ajit Kumar said: "FIs have been=
 told to work out details about the prices that each of the interested buye=
r can offer for the Dabhol project. Since it is totally buyer driven, FIs w=
ill have to take this into account while holding their discussions with the=
 potential buyers. Enron may demand any price but there have to be takers f=
or that too.'' Tata Power, Hindujas and some other leading industrial house=
s are interested in buying out Enron. FIs are going to talk individually to=
 all the interested companies, and the equity will be sold to the highest b=
idder, Kumar said.=20

According to FI sources involved with the Dabhol negotiations several angle=
s are being looked into as the matter is now complicated with Enron invokin=
g legal provisions. "The aim is to work out an out- of-court settlement to =
the issue. Valuation is not an issue as the project has a 25-year life cycl=
e,'' an official said. FI sources claimed that their role is that of a faci=
litator where they will try and bring the buyer and seller at a common poin=
t.FIs are also discussing with the Centre if it is possible for them to get=
 a cover for the second phase of the project. As of now, the first phase of=
 the project has been given the counter-guarantee while the promoters are p=
ushing for a similar cover to ensure payments.=20

Dabhol dispute unfortunate: Govt

THE GOVERNMENT on Monday described the dispute over the Enron-promoted Dabh=
ol Power Project as an `unfortunate' experience in foreign investment in th=
e country's infrastructure sector. ``Enron is a very unfortunate episode in=
 our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial i=
nfrastructure sector and I wish it had never happened,'' minister of state =
for external affairs, Omar Abdullah said here. Nevertheless, the country's =
judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enron's favour thereby pro=
ving its fair and independent nature, he added. Speaking after launching th=
e Confederation of Indian Industries International, the international arm o=
f the chamber, he said Indian industry has had enough protection and should=
 not ask for more. ``Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping ne=
w markets abroad, our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its po=
tential,'' Abdullah said.Indian missions abroad have to realise that their =
role is changing, he said it is now clear that economic diplomacy is integr=
al to foreign policy and a key determinant of a country's political and str=
ategic influence. He said the ministry of external affairs had also started=
 working on these lines and would make every possible effort to provide nec=
essary support to the country's business chambers and industry to position =
itself as a global player in the emerging global scenario.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
Power Play (Editorial)

With emotions running high over the Dabhol issue, Enron chairman Kenneth La=
y understandably showed great alacrity in denying reports that he has threa=
tened India with sanctions. In a letter to prime minister A B Vajpayee, Mr =
Lay clarified that Enron has not asked the US government to take any such a=
ction, and "is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mec=
hanisms". Fair enough. But are the remarks as innocuous as Enron is making =
them out to be? Consider the facts. In the course of the controversial inte=
rview, Mr Lay said that if Enron was "squeezed'' to accept less than the co=
st incurred by it on building the power plant, that would amount to "exprop=
riation" by the Indian government. He added, for good measure, that US laws=
 prevent Washington from assisting countries which expropriate the property=
 of American companies. Significantly, an Enron team is slated to negotiate=
 with Indian lenders this week. One of the proposals doing the rounds is th=
at the financial institutions (FIs) buy out Enron's stake in Dabhol Power C=
ompany (DPC) and `warehouse' the shares till they can find another buyer. T=
he FIs, on their part, have indicated their willingness to slash interest r=
ates on the loans to DPC in a bid to make the project viable. But they're n=
ot willing to be the only ones to make a sacrifice. So, they're expected to=
 ask Enron to accept a discount of 25 to 35 per cent on its asking price. T=
he bargaining is likely to be tough, and savvy negotiators routinely try to=
 `psyche' the opposition beforehand. Mr Lay is known to be close to the Bus=
h administration. In the light of all this, is the timing of his remarks pu=
re coincidence?=20

Mr Lay, of course, has his own compulsions. While the Dabhol imbroglio has =
undoubtedly hurt India, Enron's armour is not without some chinks  which In=
dian negotiators would do well to note. The company faces accusations, whic=
h it denies, that it manipulated power prices in California. Its share pric=
e has fallen more than 55 per cent since the start of the year, and chief e=
xecutive officer Jeffrey Skilling recently quit abruptly, forcing Mr Lay to=
 take over the CEO's job as well. Unfortunately, Indian negotiators are unl=
ikely to use what should be their trump card  the Godbole Committee's obser=
vation that the Dabhol deal was a failure of governance at every step of th=
e decision-making process. Because doing so could embarrass too many promin=
ent people on both ends of the political spectrum. Even so, the Indian side=
 should hang tough. There have been suggestions that the LNG plant be spun =
off as a separate power centre, Enron let out its harbour facilities to oth=
er LNG importers, and the foreign currency loans be converted into rupee lo=
ans. These could form the basis of a fair deal that would allow both India =
and Enron to move on from the mess they have landed in. Hopefully, the Dabh=
ol debacle will also send out warning signals to both Indian politicians an=
d multinationals about the perils of non-transparent, negotiated deals, as =
opposed to a genuinely free market. If it does, and if India gets its act t=
ogether on power sector reforms, we may yet see some light at the end of th=
e long, long tunnel.

Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol, Sanjay Dutta=20

US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washington seekin=
g sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra government =
over the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project, even as domestic financial inst=
itutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by about $483 m=
illion (Rs 2,270 crore) for its completion. In a letter to Prime Minister A=
tal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, a copy of which was available with The Tim=
es of India, Enron CEO Kenneth said: "A recent story in the Financial Times=
, which mischaracterised discussions with me, appears to have caused signif=
icant, unintended concern. Counter to the impression given in the story, I =
have not asked anyone in the US government to consider imposing sanctions."=
=20

Lay said in his letter that Enron's approach was to settle the issue amicab=
ly by selling its stake. "Furthermore, I did not say that the Dabhol power =
plant had been expropriated. Upon questioning from the publicator (publishe=
r) I did factually explained the several possible options available, includ=
ing how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to pr=
otect its businesses. However, that is far from suggesting that we have dec=
ided to pursue these mechanisms," Lay said. "Our preferred approach approac=
h continues to be to resolve this issue amicably by selling our stake to In=
dian governmental and financial institutions," Lay said.=20

However, Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding, "Without agreement =
on that, we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures joi=
ntly agreed under the power purchase agreement." Lay also sent copies of th=
e letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabh=
u. PTI ADDS: The IDBI-led FIs' consortium may increase their exposure to en=
able the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Company's equit=
y at a 25 per cent discount to its face value. The FIs are exploring a poss=
ibility of taking out offshore equity by investment institutions and utilit=
ies after 12-18 months from Phase-II completion, the report said.

 If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs, then IDBI=
's revised exposure would be at Rs 2,742 crore from existing Rs 2,121 crore=
, ICICI Rs 1,904 crore from Rs 1,473 crore, SBI Rs 2,261 crore from Rs 1,74=
9 crore, IFCI Rs 587 crore from Rs 454 crore and Canara Bank Rs 526 crore f=
rom Rs 407 crore. "Even in the best case, the exposure requirements from do=
mestic institutions exceed the prudential exposure norms," the report quote=
d FI sources as saying. Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks=
 like IDFC, PFC, PNB, Union Bank, Bank of India among others would be accru=
ed through syndication. FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a =
backup for their exposure, the report quoted the sources as saying. Last we=
ek, the FIs had made a presentation to the finance ministry on a possible b=
ailout package for Dabhol. The proposals envisage concessions from stakehol=
ders, around 22.38 per cent concessional duty on the energy major's liquefi=
ed natural gas plant, a mega power project status and offset of custom duti=
es on LNG supply.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
'Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush', Vidyadhar Date=20

Enron has denied that it had approached the U.S. government in an effort to=
 obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power projec=
t. The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursd=
ay which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay. The repor=
t quoted Mr Lay as saying there are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. g=
overnment from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated =
properties of U.S. companies. An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not dis=
cussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush.=20

Meanwhile, the legal tussle between energy activists, the Maharashtra gover=
nment and Enron continues in India. The state government is preparing a fre=
sh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the s=
upreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is the lab=
our wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and activist Abhay Meht=
a against the Dabhol project. The affidavit will make a strong case against=
 Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP dom=
inated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controve=
rsial multinational.=20

The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and =
since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and =
more evidence emerging against the project. The government will rely substa=
ntially on the M.D. Godbole committee report which found a number of infirm=
ities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities.=
 In the petition, CITU and Abhay Mehta, author of the book Power Play, whic=
h gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama, have challenged the clea=
rance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority. They argue=
d that since the project had been renegotiated, it required a fresh review =
by the CEA. They described as false the claim of the previous government th=
at by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff.=
=20

Anti-Enron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recen=
t setbacks received by the company. Regarding the explosion in Enron's Tees=
ide plant in England which left three workers dead, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, ener=
gy activist, said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for=
 the Dabhol plant.Enron suffered a serious setback last week with the resig=
nation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, the drastic fall in stocks and =
the explosion in the Teeside plant. Mr Kenneth Lay, the company's chairpers=
on, is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the U.S., explaining=
 the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall St=
reet. While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India, it is also re=
ported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Acti=
vists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity =
being voiced in other parts of the world. Anti-privatisation activists inva=
ded the legislature building in the Brazilian state of Parana last week, pr=
otesting against the move to privatise the state's electric generation, tra=
nsmission and distribution utility.=20

Vince --

I realize you may be busy with the news that UBS is the winning bidder for
Enron's trading organization.

Looking ahead, I invite you to speak at the Market Price Volatility
conference, to be held May 1-3, in Houston.

This follows on the Gas Volatility and Storage Valuation conference held
last October. This spring's conference will focus on power volatility, and
will include a number of applied econometric presentations.

The format of the preconference workshop, on Wednesday, May 1, will be much
the same as in the past. Your speaking slot is for a one-hour presentation
in the afternoon, followed by a roundtable.

I hope you will join in what promises to be a stimulating event.

Please confirm your participation by e-mailing or calling me by
Thursday, Jan. 17.

Following your confirmation, Jim Naphas of INFOCAST will be in touch
regarding the usual details.

Best regards.

Hi Vince,
 
Hope my mail reaches you. I am really sorry that the Enron saga is coming to such an end. I have closely followed developments through the press. Personally, I continue to be proud to be associated with the company and more specifically with the Dabhol Project. I have learned a lot in my three years at Enron and hope to continue to learn from the experiences of its people.
 
I saw you at Rice a few weeks back, but you were very busy and was hence unable to talk with you. I am leaving for India tomorrow and will return only in the second week of January. Its probably obvious, but the enron debacle has affected my future career options and also does severely constrain me in more ways than one. Hope the lunch offer still stands open, will take you up on it in January. 
 
I hope the holidays prove to be a time of relaxation for you and your family. Wish you a merry christmas and Best wishes for the new year to you and your family.
 
Regards,
Anshuman

Subject:	Get Together This Coming Tuesday?


Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

ABSTRACT:

  SUBJECT AREAS: Risk management, financial innovation, options
  and derivatives.
  CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S.


  In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific
  Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather
  derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of
  megawatt hours (MWh) sold.

  The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of
  how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not
  want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether
  to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or
  derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may
  be used as an introduction to options.

  The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and
  deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW.
  Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability
  distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability
  distribution for the net operating contribution including the
  contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives.
  It is instructive for the students to think about what would be
  the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent.
  This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio.

  Specific learning objectives of these cases include these:

  - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial
    innovation

  - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk

  - to challenge the students to value options where the
    Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be
    readily employed

  - to experience the perspective of top management in risk
    management activities.

Hi Vince,
 
I just thought I'd check in to see if you had resolved  your space issue for your analysts.  If so, I would love to send you some  people to consider for your team!  
 
Hope your summer is going well and that you are surviving all  the rain!  I recently spent a week rafting through the Grand  Canyon...an adventure I would highly recommend.
 
Hope to hear from you!
 
Regards,

Dear Mark and Vince
 
I know that it has been very trying for us all, but  I do believe that we have got there in the end! I have attached a copy of the  programme that I will send to the printers. Unless I hear from you  by tomorrow my time, I will ask the printer to proceed with the information  that I have.
 
We can discuss the exact specifics and logistics in  the near future. I will of course be in touch again and will send you both  copies of the brochure when it is printed. 
 
In the meantime, can I please have the following  information over the next few days (I know my demands are endless, but at least  they are no longer pressing!):
 
- a professional CV, around 70 to 100 words should  be fine
- your address
 
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  look forward to working with you both on GARP 2002.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

Sheridan,

I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call 
about this. I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation 
study we discussed at San Antonio. Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on
to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study.
Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making
inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area,
regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we
already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount
rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential
values.

It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling. It would
also help if you could write a formal letter to him.


Vince

Dear Vince:

That is great news that Jeffrey Skilling will be speaking at our
conference.  By getting Skillings involvement we should be able to increase
the quality of the conference by at least a few notches.

By the way, Shirley may have mentioned to you that I somehow received two
checks for the work I did last spring.  I went off to Hong Kong this summer
and didn't follow up on this other than to mention it to Shirley before I
left. (I just got back last Friday.) Shirley left me a phone message to
mail the check back to her.  If you can email Shirley's last name and
mailing address to me I'll send her the check.  Also, if you are interested
in having me do some work on the valuation issues we discussed at the Texas
Finance Festival please let me know.

One more thing:  The university that I'm affliliated with in Hong Kong
(HKUST) just hired a new president, Paul Chu, who is from Houston and has
some sort of relationship with Ken Lay.  The Dean at the HKUST business
school mentioned that Paul Chu was meeting with Ken Lay this summer and
would discuss possible avenues of collaboration.  If you can think of
anything that you would be interested in let me know and I can discuss it
with the Dean.

I hope you are having a great summer and look forward to seeing you when
you come to Austin this fall for our energy finance class and in February
for the conference.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Hope your day is going well. Philip Merrill suggested I contact you
regarding a conference I'm organizing on Implementing the Commodities
Futures Modernization Act. The conference will include sections on Single
Stock Futures, Clearing and Trading Facilities. The latter section will
include a session on the new electronic exchanges and I would like to invite
Enron to speak on their electronic energy trading exchange.

The conference will take place September 20 - 21, 2001 at The Drake Hotel in
Chicago. The session will be in the afternoon on Thursday, September 20. I
expect the conference will draw 100 executives from broker dealers, futures
commissions merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators,
introducing brokers, investment banks, exchanges, and clearing firms.

The Institute for International Research (IIR) is the world's largest
international conference company with 120 different business units and 4,000
employees in 36 countries. Founded in 1973 by Irvine Laidlaw, the current
Chairman, IIR continues to provide unbiased, bleeding-edge business
information through our conferences, workshops, seminars, and the Internet.
For more information on IIR, please visit our website at
http://www.iirusa.com.

A draft agenda is attached for your review. Please note it is a work in
progress and I will be finalizing it over the next week. I welcome any
feedback on how to improve the program, as well as any speaker suggestions.

Thanks again for your assistance. I'll follow-up with you next week, but
please feel free to contact me in the interim with any questions.

Enjoy your weekend.

Billy,

We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.

He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
complain that the question is too detailed.


He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).

   Would it be trouble if we started lunch at 12:30?

   If it is, I'll still pick you up at noon.

Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce

A reminder: this column serves two objectives. The firstis introduction of  
new members of the Research Group, and of the associates andsummer interns  
rotating through the group. The second objective is to reviewinteresting  
publications related to energy markets, quantitative finance andother topics  
of interest to the Enron audience. I have run out of the newmembers to  
introduce and it's time to some real work. 

Today's column is devoted to the issue of technicalanalysis. Financial  
economists tend to dismiss technical analysis (chartism) asvoodoo science.  
Over the last few years, however, a significant amount ofevidence that  
technical analysis works at least in some markets. A paperpublished recently  
by Carol Osler of Federal Reserve Bank of New York (CurrencyOrders and  
Exchange-Rate Dynamics: Explaining the Success of Technical Analysis)reviews  
two cases in which technical analysis proved quite successful inoffering  
useful predictions in the foreign currency markets. The firstprediction is  
that trends tend to be reversed at identifiable support orresistance levels.  
The second is that if a support or resistance level isbreached, trends tend  
to accelerate. 

The explanation of this success can be found, according toCarol Osler, in the  
microstructure of the F/X market: take-profit and stop-lossorders tend to  
cluster around certain typical levels (like exchange rate endingin a specific  
market at 00 or 50 level). For example, the author found thatthat roughly  
2.8% of all stop-loss buy orders are triggered when the rate hitsa round  
number, while 10.5% of take profit sales orders are triggered. Thisasymmetry  
explains the success of the first prediction of technical analysis. Asecond  
asymmetry is related to clustering of orders just above and just belowround  
numbers ending in 50 and 00. Stop-loss buy orders are infrequent at ratesjust  
below these levels, and cluster above these levels. Stop-loss sell  
orders,however, cluster just below 00 and 50 levels a relatively scarce at  
rates justabove these levels.  

The question remains, why conditional orders tend tocluster at certain  
levels. One possibility is cognitive advantage tradersderive from managing  
large volume of information using simplified rules.Another possibility is  
that they follow recommendations of technical analysisin managing their  
books. In this case, technical analysis becomes aself-fulfilling prophecy. 

Please, contact us for thecopy of the paper if this caught your attention.

Shalesh told me that his visited his HR screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an Associate.
This entry was reversed later.

Any reason for that? It may be related to his transfer from EBS.
We can check with his previous business unit whether they gave /promised him a promotion.

Vince,

As per our conversation yesterday I would very much appreciate it if you could help me with this matter.  I was under the impression that I would be promoted to Associate this August, which according to my pay stub and eHRonline hasn't occurred.  According to the A/A rules, a copy of which I am attaching below, an Analyst can be promoted to Associate if he/she falls under one of the criteria among several.  The one I believe I am eligible under states:

-  completed 2 years in the Program; have a performance rating of Excellent or above; and have either (1) an appropriate graduate degree or (2)  1 year of relevant commercial work experience prior to Enron

Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to look into this issue.  Thank you very much for your time and help.

Correlation of power and gas volatility to Enron's trading earnings
Comparable analysis of Enron ROVAR to other trading organizations (e.g. banks, hedge funds, etc..)
Analysis of amount of economic capital versus cash in order to support a certain VAR


If there is anything that we can do in order to help with the request, please let me know.  Again thank you very much for all of your help.

Angela,

So far, nobody in my group who was asked about Netco, including myself, expressed interest in 
this new company.

Also, one modification of the list since Friday. Paulo Issler quit last week.

Dear Youyi Feng,

Firstly, I apologize that I haven't contacted you earlier; the reason is
that I've been very busy traveling. We met in Hawaii conference and I
promised to send the paper that I presented there to you. This paper is
now
enclosed and I hope you find the model useful, at least in the future.

In this bandwidth area I'm working closely with my friends (EigenValue
Ltd.)
and they've office in my home country Finland. In the electricity market
I've been consulting few electricity companies in Scandinavia and it
seems
that the market there is working pretty well. I also added one paper in
this
field.

In Hawaii you told me something about your interests in Revenue
Management
models. Fortunately, one of my friend, Costis Maglaras (Professor in
Columbia Business School, c.maglaras@columbia.edu), is working in this
area
and he would be very happy to talk with you about the implementation of
these models into everyday industry practice.

If you are interested I'd very much like to visit Enron and give a talk
there. Especially, I'd like to learn more about your company, the
reputation
of Enron is impressive!

Best regards, Jussi

Wade,

I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who
faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna
from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.

A brief outline of the facts.

1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years
ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival
was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy
is also very complicated.

2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a 
tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the
term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with
the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.

The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an 
outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American 
society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his 
behalf to the State Department.

I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational
approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.

I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's
behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. 
I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.

Thanks.

Vince

Hi Vince & Rick, attached is a resume of a friend of mine from when I worked in NYC.  This guys has MIT Aerospace background but has extensive trading and risk management experience--one of those with commercial and technical experience.  He is an excellent team player with great personality as far as working in stressed and dynamic environment goes. He will do well at Enron.  I think he is ready to try Houston like I did as he is ready to raise a family.

Please forward to appropriate parties if there are no immediate opportunities.

Hi Andrea!

What we have found is the following:

Housing starts by state does not exist from a U.S. Government statistical source however we have been able to find a monthly data source that maybe useful and correlate with housing starts. The U.S. census presently provides building permits on a monthly basis from 1995 to April 2001. The website gets updated on the 20th of each month (i.e. May's statistics will come out on June 20th).  This data is available by state and metropolitan areas (MSA) (e.g. cities and counties). Before January 1995 they have only annual data on a state by state and on a city-by-city basis which starts in 1980 . This website has the monthly data divided up into the actual number of permits given that month and another chart that has year to date permits from the beginning of the year.    
http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/const/www/permitsindex.html

By Metropolitan Area

http://www.census.gov/const/www/C40/table3.html

By State:

http://www.census.gov/const/www/C40/table2.html

Although the U.S. Government does not have a statistical source for Housing Starts, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) does provide the information. 
Please note that the NAHB website only displays regional breakdown of housing starts by region.  We called the National Association of Home Builders and they informed us that they do have annual data by state and it is published twice a year for a nominal charge of $250.00.  The person we contacted at the NAHB is Dean Christ at (202) 822-0478.

I would like to attend the East Power sessions.  For the group in general, maybe Thursday staff meetings would work, since then everybody gets exposed to the concepts.

The East Power Fundamentals group has asked that we give a transmission primer for the analysts in their group.  Lance and I have accepted and will be presenting two talks.  I think the same material might be useful for the Research Group at large (perhaps via Thursday staff meetings or Friday brownbags) and/or a few technical corner articles.  Topics would include a glossary of terms/jargon/acronyms, basic concepts (voltage, real and reactive power, transfer limits, loop flow), structure of the network (NERC regions, major hubs, etc), and congestion issues (TLR and FTR/TCC, examples of traditional bottlenecks).  If done in a series, we could also solicit questions for explanation at a subsequent talk (if not answered on the spot).

The talks for East Power are scheduled for Aug 7 and 21 at 3pm.  We could potentially have Research members attend the East Power sessions.

Would you like to have this done for Research and what forum would you prefer?

Thanks,
Martin

Vince:

Have you or a member of your group had a chance to look over the forwarded =
e-mail yet?  We have a meeting on Thursday with another potential client wh=
o plans to use his own capital.  His capital budgeting issues are similar t=
o those of the client who prompted my original e-mail.

The more DSM projects that we can help the client get approved, the more DS=
M savings we can share with the client.  These DSM projects can turn a reta=
il commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more prof=
itable contract for us.

Would one of your GARCH analyses provide us with a quantitative solution?  =
One of your experts in differential equations might have devised something.=
  We'd really like to have something quantitative if you think it's at all =
possible.

Subject:=09DSM projects as real options  =20

Vince:

Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Po=
int presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the following:=
  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES customers who =
employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lo=
wered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow for the extra =
value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consum=
ption/dependence.

I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewi=
ng a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive. =
 First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we exer=
cise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple N=
PV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate "negawatts," ext=
ending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of =
which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options=
 are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--wheneve=
r the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity pric=
e, associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value o=
f this strip a "residual time value" associated with the original DSM optio=
n.  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total va=
lue that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able =
to help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high =
IRR hurdle.

Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a =
"qualitative" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers t=
o lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The=
 attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.

We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least=
 one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage aroun=
d his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside =
a large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a sma=
ll portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology,=
 which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.

In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification=
, or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in th=
e attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify "resid=
ual time value" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of=
 a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?

Thanks,

Jeff Gray

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would li=

of our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the de=

calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results depen=
ding
on the quality of inputs.=20

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We =

Subject:=09California Update 6/1/01


Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State T=
reasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the i=
nitial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is al=
so not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's =
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric fu=
tures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return fo=
r money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor thi=
s plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of legisla=
tors are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve Californi=
a's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish legislato=
rs, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and busines=
s leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the plan =
is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power Aut=
hority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up transmiss=
ion lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly legislated =
authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) although=
 they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power co=
mpanies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarant=
ee a 5%-15% "cushion" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton wan=
t to create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of=
 the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector g=
eneration.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new p=
lants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds (=
in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in th=
e Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consume=
rs and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this gr=
oup and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45%=
 increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there i=
s immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on bu=
sinesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by prev=
ious PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: sto=
p the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent emergen=
cy tax hikes (being serious considered last week). =20
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current=
 shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owe=
d debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal=
 Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to "eat" in the legislated r=
epayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts b=
e?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to =
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive =
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.

CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote 
Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a "preference payment" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.  The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.  It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.  Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.  This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.

Subject:	Patent attorney

Vince: 
I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
position by filing my own "provisional patent application."  This establishes  
the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
282-1856. 
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:   
pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) 
yet2come.com 
Hope this is helpful. 
Regards,

If you would like to bring your own copies to the event I would ask you to

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her
the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates
rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hello Vince;

Joseph Doucet has passed along your name to me, in regards to exploring
opportunities between Enron, and the Natural Resources and Energy MBA
students at the U.of A. I would be pleased to assist in any capacity, from
helping organize an information session by Enron to our students in the fall
at the U.of A., to co-ordinating job interviews for permanent or summer
internship positions, and everything in between! My function is to assist
MBA students and appropriate corporations to find each other! I look forward
to hearing from you.

Regards, Barry.

Dear Dr Kaminsky,

on behalf of the Scientific Committee of the 2nd World Congress of the
Bachelier Finance Society, it is my pleasure to invite you to give one of
the plenary lectures.

The Bachelier Finance Society came into being in 1996 by the initiative of
mathematical finance researchers who found the need to create an
organization where academia and practitioners would meet and exchange
ideas spanning on the crossroads between Finance, Economics, Econometrics,
Insurance and Mathematics.

The conference is the Society's second biannual meeting and it will take
place in the island of Crete, from June 12 to June 15, 2002.
The other members of the Scientific Committee are G.Constantinides,
M.Davis, F.Delbaen, D.Duffie, H.Foellmer, M.Jeanblanc and E.Platen.
Either myself or any other member of the committee would be happy to
discuss with you about the Conference and the Society.

Crete is one of the most beautiful greek islands. The conference will take
place in a resort in Xersonissos, a picturesque site close to Irakleion
and Knossos. The airfare (economy class) and all local expenses (lodging,
meals and local transportation) will be covered.

We will all be honored by your presence.

Sincerely,

Thaleia Zariphopoulou

Chair of the Scientific Committee
V.N.Neuhaus Professor
Dpts of Mathematics and MSIS
The University of Texas at Austin

Subject:	Discussion of California Background & Issues

Attached please find the write-up on California.  

The paper includes four sections - (1) Background & Status, (2) Upcoming Issues & Recommendations, (3) Legislative and Regulatory History of California Restructuring, and (4) Summary of PG&E - Enron Correspondence on Payment of Negative CTC.

We have also pulled together most of the primary documents (CPUC Orders, Legislation, etc.) that are discussed in this paper.  This material is quite lengthy and if anyone wants a copy, please let me know (I intend to send one to Tim Belden/Steve Swain).

If we need to hold a meeting to discuss any of this, I'll be happy to set something up for tomorrow.

Thanks,

Jim

 Les buveurs de vin plus intelligents que les amateurs de bi?re
Lundi 27 ao?t 2001
(LEMONDE.FR)


Le match entre tenants de la chope de bi?re et amoureux du verre de vin a-t-il trouv? son ?pilogue ? Apr?s les ?tudes attestant des effets b?n?fiques du ballon de rouge dans la pr?vention du cancer de l'intestin et celle, publi?e la semaine derni?re en Tch?coslovaquie, vantant les vertus des blondes contre les maladies cardiaques, le suspense ?tait ? son comble. L'?tude sur les m?rites compar?s des buveurs de chacune des boissons, publi?e le 14 ao?t au Danemark, est donc arriv?e ? point nomm?.


"Nous sommes les premiers au monde qui avons pu d?montrer clairement que les buveurs de vin sont plus intelligents et fonctionnent beaucoup mieux ? tous les ?gards que les amateurs de bi?re", s'est f?licit? Erik Lykke Mortensen, chercheur en psychologie au centre danois des sciences ?pid?miologiques, dans les colonnes du B.T. le 14 ao?t. Le quotidien ? grand tirage, relay? par la tr?s s?rieuse revue Archives of International Medecine, d?taille la gen?se de l'?tude : diligent?e par l'universit? de Copenhague en collaboration avec le Kinsey Institute, aux Etats-Unis, elle partait de l'hypoth?se - ?mise par plusieurs ?tudes danoises r?centes - que les buveurs mod?r?s de vin sont en meilleure sant? que les personnes consommatrices d'autres boissons alcoolis?es.


Les chercheurs se sont pench?s sur 363 hommes et 303 femmes ?g?s de 29 ? 34 ans. Ils ont pass? au crible le statut socio-?conomique, le niveau d'?ducation, le quotient intellectuel, les sympt?mes psychiatriques, la personnalit? et le comportement en mati?re de sant?, notamment la consommation d'alcool, de chacun des cobayes. Lesquels ont ?t? divis?s en deux cat?gories, selon qu'ils buvaient de la bi?re ou du vin.


Il a ?t? observ? que boire du vin est associ? ? des QI, une ?ducation et un statut socio-?conomique ?lev?s. A l'inverse, les consommateurs de bi?re obtiennent des r?sultats bien moins probants. Qui plus est, le buveur de vin semble psychologiquement plus ?quilibr? que l'amateur de mousse.


Alors, est-ce le vin qui rend intelligent ou le fait d'?tre intelligent qui incite ? boire du vin ? Les scientifiques ont choisi le second terme de l'alternative. Ainsi, les effets apparemment b?n?fiques du vin r?sulteraient surtout d'une bonne ?ducation, notamment sur les questions de sant?, et de la mod?ration de ses consommateurs. Ces conclusions viennent conforter les Danois dans leur nouvelles habitudes. Traditionnellement grands adeptes de la bi?re, ils sont de plus en plus nombreux ? s'adonner au vin. Les ?tudes utiles font les peuples intelligents.

It seems, however, that she has no

I know that each of you has just said,  "FINALLY",  and I do apologize for the delay.   As I explained to you earlier this week, Ken, we wouldn't want to have you actually sign the papers until very close to your last day at Enron, because the interest will run from the date of your signature. 

Please take a look at the document and call me with any questions.  I will need to know the exact loan amount to complete the loan document, and will have to ask Legal to sign off before it's executed.

Buried Cities
-------------

Recently I saw a TV show in which archaeologists were uncovering a
buried city. What's up with that? I mean, even if you were the
dumbest of all ancient peoples, wouldn't you notice that your city
was slowly getting covered up with dirt and maybe crank up your
housekeeping efforts a notch? And don't tell me that brooms hadn't
been invented yet. They had plenty of sticks and plenty of
chickens, so you'd think that by pure coincidence one day a chicken
would back into a stick and invent the broom.

Maybe when the dirt builds up gradually you don't notice a problem
until your house disappears. I can imagine the conversation on the
day they figured out what was happening:

Ixphalup:  Hey, Fnorkzak, be a dear and go downstairs and get
           my stone bowl, the crude one.

Fnorkzak:  Downstairs is gone. It's all dirt.

Ixphalup:  Uh oh, fetch Grandpa; it's time to abandon the
           city.

Fnorkzak:  He's downstairs, most of him anyway, except for
           the top of his head.

Ixphalup:  Hmm... It sounds like I found a new bowl.


I like to mock the ancients, but I'm a bad housekeeper myself,
albeit not on the "lost city" scale. Sometimes I'll lose a pencil
-- at most a sneaker -- to the growing sediment layer before I'm
forced by the homeowners' association to sell the house. But I'm
too fastidious to lose anything big like a car or sofa.

Fun fact: Until Mayor Giuliani cleaned up New York City, the
highest building was two stories tall and no one could remember
when anything had been taller.

Disturbing Trend
-----------------

Stay with me on this line of reasoning: Vice President Dick Cheney
recently got a defibrillator to keep his heart beating. He also has
corrective lenses to enhance his vision. He has fillings in his
teeth so he can eat and he has a cell phone in his pocket.
Individually these items mean nothing but collectively they raise
an important question:

     How much hardware can you have attached to your
     body before you're technically a cyborg?

I'm worried that Cheney is already a cyborg. Without the hardware,
he'd be a blind, starving, bald guy with no pulse. That's a pretty
good argument for defining him as part man, part machine. The
disturbing thing is this: To whom does he pledge his allegiance --
machines or people?

If I'm right, within two years Cheney will be living inside a
hardened mountain in Wyoming, hardwired into the national missile
defense grid. And we'll all become slaves to our machine overlords.
Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs.
Television sets will make you dance for their amusement. It won't
be pretty.

Before you rush to label me paranoid, consider who elected Cheney
in the first place. Sure, we humans pulled the levers and poked the
chads, but in the end the machines did the counting and elected one
of their own.

And you'll notice that Cheney supports any policy that results in
more hardware, like the Star Wars missile defense shield and more
oil drilling. I think this is how machines reproduce. First they
conquer the humanoid government and then they create tax incentives
to produce more machines. The ants are milking the aphids and we're
the aphids.

I don't know what George W. Bush's role is in all this, but if you
look at his recent photos you'll see that he always has a little
oil can with him.

The irony is that Al Gore lost the election largely because he
looked like a robot. In fact, he was only an advanced android from
a distant nebula sent here as a prank.

Anyway, I'm worried that somehow Cheney will get control of the
Internet and ...

Boss and Cow-orker Quotes
-------------------------

Here now, more true-life quotes from bosses and cow-orkers,
submitted by DNRC members.

----

During one meeting with clients my boss told them to, "Cut the cake
a different way and go for the lowest hanging fruit."  I told him
he should tell them to go for the lowest hanging plums.....

----

We used to have a vice president who had a way with words.  He told
us during a meeting that we couldn't start a new program because,
"We'd be biting off a new can of worms."

When he was hiring a new secretary he said that he "had been
interviewing some good suspects."

My assistant told me, "Don't kiss a gift horse in the mouth."

---

Combining two quotes to stress the fact that he had a backup plan,
my boss said, "I've got a card in my hole."

---

I was driving to the Omaha, Nebraska, airport with my boss and our
conversation led to airport food.  He said the last time he ate the
food at the Omaha airport it gave him gonorrhea.  (We think he
meant diarrhea.)

---

"Well, it's no skin off MY teeth!"

A friend's mother frequently uses the phrase, "sweating like a
stuck pig."

----

All from one boss...

"That's just cutting your throat to spite your face."

"We have to be careful not to put all our apples in one cart."

"This project is like pulling hen's teeth."

"I'm being raped over the coals."

----

In a misguided attempt to motivate me, my pointy-haired boss once
said, "Remember!  There is no 'I' in 'Team Spirit'!"

I tried to explain that there are two of them in there but it
seemed to confuse him.

----

A true quote from my sister's pointy-haired boss:

"I don't want to throw another monkey at the wrench right now."

----

My boss was pleased that with one phone call we had "killed two
stones."

----

A good PHB misquote:

"...if we pass mustard..."

----

At one meeting my boss said, "That'll put the can amongst the
worms."

---

I have a friend whose supervisor proudly proclaimed that her new
car was a "Honda Accordion Hunchback."  By the way, she was the
supervisor of the Customer Service department.



Lazy Entrepreneur
-----------------
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/lazyentrepreneur/

The Lazy Entrepreneur feature on Dilbert.com has over 4,000
brilliant ideas submitted by DNRC members. I just submitted a new
one that I call BIG DOG SHIELD. It's a Plexiglas(tm) shield you can
use when visiting the home of someone who has a huge exuberant
slobbering dog who insists on jumping and drooling all over your
good clothes. You'd only need the shield for the first five minutes
of the visit, until the dog calms down. Florist shops could rent
the BIG DOG SHIELD to young men on prom night when they pick up
their corsages. When the young man arrives at his date's house, and
her big slobbering dog lunges toward his rented tuxedo with forty
toenails and nine pounds of wet tongue, the young man can toss the
corsage in the foyer and hide behind the BIG DOG SHIELD until his
date is ready to go. It's not the most macho way to start a date,
but it's better than wearing slobber to the prom.


True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Induhviduals continue to amaze and amuse. Here are more True Tales,
submitted by DNRC members.

---

Actual conversation I overheard in school:

Induhvidual 1:  "If the Eiffel tower is a bridge, how come
                you can't drive on it?"

Induhvidual 2:  "The Eiffel tower isn't a bridge."

Induhvidual 1:  "Yes it is. You can walk across it, and it
                has two tall block things."

Induhvidual 2:  "The last time I was in New York it wasn't a
                bridge."


----

Here's a true Induhvidual story that I found in the Swedish
newspaper "Sydsvenska Dagbladet."

Four people were chosen randomly and asked if they were concerned
that they might buy products produced by children. Three of the
four people said they think child labor is horrible and that they
would never buy products made by children. The fourth person missed
the point entirely and said that she wouldn't buy these products
since children "have no feeling for quality, which will result in
poorer quality of the final product."

----

A few years ago, as a solar eclipse approached, some planetarium
directors in Southern California sent out warnings to the community
about the eclipse. Experience shows that daytime darkness leads to
accidents among Induhviduals, and also they have been known to
stare at the partially eclipsed sun and blind themselves.  (Honest.
It really happens.)  The planetarium received an indignant letter
from a local Induhvidual.  She said that if an eclipse was so
dangerous, they never should have decided to hold one and ought to
cancel it.

-----

My dad always locked his keys in the car by accident.  He had been
doing this for about a year, when one day, he approached my mom and
said, "You know what?  I'm going to leave the coat hanger in the
trunk so I can unlock the car the next time this happens."

-----

Our company accountant came and asked for a new power strip and I
gave him one. Then he asked if I could come and install it for him.
I told him it was pretty simple - shutdown computer, unplug
everything, remove existing strip, plug in new strip, plug in
computer, turn it on. He said, "Really?"

Recognizing the opportunity I said, "Well, you also have to Telnet
into the device, and make sure it's set for English voltage and not
metric or else you'll burn up the motherboard." He looked confused
and said, "I'll wait until you have time to install it."

---

I saw a lady on TV who liked to collect Nativity scenes. She
proudly showed off one of her favorite sets, where the figures,
according to her description, were "African-American."

-----

We had a CONsultant come in to our company who helped us determine
our personality types so that we could learn to work together
better.  She uses the Jung-Myers-Briggs Typology and one of the
continuums it ranks you on is Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P).
She paired up people who fell into the P category with people who
were in the J category for an exercise in which they were supposed
to try to think like the other.  The president of our company said
he didn't understand the purpose so she tried to explain it to him.

"You have a lot of J-ness, but not enough P-ness."

Needless to say the exercise was never completed.

---

Recently the teachers' contract in my school district ran out and
the teachers demanded a 4% raise.  Two weeks before the strike date
the school board passed out an exam to all students; the average
grade was 49%. The school board told the teachers that this was
unacceptable and there would be no raises. But they offered that
the teachers could get 1% pay increases for every 3% the average
test score increased on the next test. The union came back with one
demand, that the teachers create the tests. The next test average
was 76%, which the school board credited to "our ability to
motivate our teachers." And how.

-----

A couple of years ago at college, I went to the library to get a
signed statement that I did not have any unpaid library fines. This
was required to get my exam results. The woman at the counter wrote
down my name and student ID followed by, "does not have any fines
at the libara." She crossed off the last word and tried again with
"liberery", then crossed that out and wrote "here."

I wonder what she uses as her job title?

----

One day in the cafeteria at my school a girl was asking for
donations for a foundation named after a boy who had a terminal
illness.  Unfortunately the boy had recently died, so she was
asking us to "donate money for this dead kid."  My Induhvidual
buddy actually asked her how money could help a dead kid.  When she
said -- get this-- "It might help with the autopsy," he responded,
"Oh, so they might still be able to cure him?"

My friend's seven-month pregnant wife was returning to her car with
her three-year-old daughter after shopping in the mall.  The
daughter wanted to play driver so Linda (not her real name) allowed
her daughter to sit in the driver's seat.  The daughter insisted
that Linda sit in the backseat of her four-door Honda.  After a
couple of minutes of playtime Linda decided it was time to go home.
She tried to get out of the car but the childproof locks wouldn't
let her open the back doors of the car. So Linda crawled between
the two front seats, then crawled headfirst out to the parking.
Upon returning home she told her tale of woe to her husband who --
being the sensitive guy he is -- said, "Why didn't you roll down
the window and open the door from the outside?"

----

When I worked at Barnes & Noble years ago I had a customer ask
where we kept the "large-print audio books."

----

My teenage daughter sometimes forgets her house key and is locked
out after school. Her first choice of entry is to ask our neighbor
to get out his ladder and climb in a window on the second floor and
unlock a door. She's done this several times. We get to tease her a
lot about being an airhead.

So one day I locked myself out on the way to do errands. I was in
the car before I even realized I had left my keys inside. So,
thinking of my daughter's solution, I asked my laughing neighbor
for help. Being a nice guy, he obliged with his ladder, climbing to
the second story, etc.

Later that day, I was relating the story to my husband. When I got
to the part about sitting in the car without the keys he said, "And
then you took the garage door opener out of the glove compartment
and let yourself in?"

-----

My local supermarket recently had a campaign to raise money for the
Jimmy Fund, a New England charity for children with cancer. At the
checkout, clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar
to the Jimmy Fund.

As I left the store, I noticed the hand-lettered sign by the door:
"Fight Children With Cancer."

Geez, I thought, don't those poor kids have it hard enough already?

----

My first year of graduate school, I moved into an apartment that
didn't have a smoke detector. After doing some checking into state
landlord-tenant law, I confirmed my suspicion that the landlady was
required to provide us with a smoke detector, so I took the issue
up with the landlady.  My Induhvidual of a roommate was upset with
me for this, fearing that by "rocking the boat" I was going to get
us kicked out of the apartment. She summed up her arguments to me
by saying, "Besides which, I don't see why we even need a smoke
detector.  Back home in Kentucky, we never had a smoke detector at
our house and we never once had a fire."

----

My company experienced a power outage (California).  When all was
dark, several employees grabbed the flashlights that are stored in
boxes in the hallway for just such an occasion.  One employee's
flashlight was very dim, suggesting that the battery was not fully
charged.  I noticed that he was repeatedly holding his hand over
the front of the flashlight, then pulling it away.  When I asked
him what he was doing he explained that he was "trying to build up
a lot of light."

-----

At Badwater, Death Valley, there's a sign on a rock to indicate sea
level. I overheard a couple of Induhviduals who were looking at
the sign and talking.

The woman says, "I wonder if it's the top or bottom."

"Of the sign?" her husband asks.

"No, of the sea," she replied.

-----

Being the "scientific" one around the office, an Induhvidual asked
me if I knew about telescopes.  I said yes and she explained that
she bought her son a telescope but she couldn't seem to get it to
focus on any stars.  I told her to point it at houses down the
street with lights and see if she could see anything.  She said,
"You can use a telescope to look at things on the ground?"  As it
turns out, focusing wasn't the problem.  It had been an overcast
evening and she thought the telescope was strong enough to get
through the clouds to see stars.


---

I saw this sign on a Chinese restaurant:

KING CRAP
2 for $35

I think they meant King Crab but I can't be sure.

----

A Burger King restaurant in Rome, NY, was advertising for
"Closers"... but the "C" was removed or blown away from their
marquee so it read "Losers Wanted."

----

I heard this from an Induhvidual standing near the Continental
Divide at Yellowstone Park:

"On which side of the Continental Divide does the water flow
uphill?"

----

There is a locked suggestion box in the cafeteria of my company. I
just found out from HR that no one has a key for it.

---

My wife manages a convenience store.  Yesterday a mother and
daughter (maybe two years old) came into the store.  When the
mother was ready to go to the register, she called to her daughter,
"Ampersand! Ampersand!  Let's go honey."

My wife couldn't believe what she heard, so she asked the customer,
"What's your daughter's name?" and the Induhvidual replied,
"Ampersand.  I don't know what it means, but I think it's a lovely
girl's name."

-----

With the recent and spectacular downturn of the stock market there
has been a lot of concern in the mutual fund industry as "assets
under management" shrink.  While we haven't experienced layoffs,
the environment has been eroded to the point where many people have
left the company of their own accord.  In an effort to bolster
morale, the marketing people and HR teamed up and delivered bunches
of those sporting-event foam hands with the index finger sticking
up to proclaim our company as "Number one!"  But it seems that the
legal department got involved too, so in large letters this big
finger declares: "For internal use only!"

Dear Mr. Adams,

When my local newspaper moved Dilbert to the business section it
became three frames instead of four. Was that your decision or the
paper's?

      Ana


Dear Anal,

Mr. Adams creates over 100 frames for every daily strip, thanks to
the help of highly trained capuchin monkeys. The newspapers receive
the whole pile and throw away whatever frames they don't like. Some
keep one or two frames, and a few who have no taste keep as many as
three or four. Mr. Adams used to feel bad about his ratio until he
learned that the creator of The Family Circus actually draws a full
length animated motion picture every day -- using absolutely no
monkeys -- and the newspapers only use one frame. That's gotta be
frustrating.


     Sincerely,


     Dogbert



Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Good morning Vince,

NEM needs to close above 17.20 to show upside potential. A stronger mining play looks like AU.

I want to thank you for going to bat for me as much as I hear that you did.  Enron was a company where my skills could be very beneficially used. I regret that we didn't get to scratch the surface of what I could contribute. I feel that beyond being business associates, you and I became good friends. I hope that can remain constant through out the future. 

The one true question that I would like to pose to you is this. It appears that the political arena here at Enron is currently unfavorable for technical analysis. Without fear of hurting my feeling one way or the other, should I consider having future opportunities with Enron once, if and when, the management situation becomes different?

If nothing ever meshs, that does do stop you from contacting me whenever you need Candlestick/technical evaluations.

Your good friend,


Steve

The five of us will be riding together for the May 2 short course.  Perhaps leaving at 9am would be best to give sufficient time for lunch before the course.  Would an estimated departure from Enron at that time be suitable to everybody?

Subject:	Data Mining Course

Vince,

In the light of our discussion this morning about EOL, I have investigated the possibility of taking a two-day Data Mining Course. I believe this would considerably help in coming up with ideas about how to analyse the EOL database, as well as providing some initial experience in the use of data mining tools and techniques. I found several possible courses that could prove valuable in this regard, and some of these are listed below. The first of these was recommended by Eric (Cope), and is the earliest of the courses that I could find, so I will plan on registering for it unless there is good reason not to.

1. "STATISTICAL LEARNING AND DATA MINING: from Supervised to Unsupervised Learning" - Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (both of Stanford Univeristy); to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sept. 6-7, 2001; Cost = $1,250. (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/MRC/mrc.general.html)
2. "How to Successfully Mine Data" - Dr. Richard De Veaux and Herbert Edelstein (Two Crows Corporation); to be held in Bethesda, Maryland, October 8-9, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.twocrows.com/dmcourse.htm)
3. "Statistical Data Mining" - Dr. Brian D. Ripley (University of Oxford, sponsored by Insightful); to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 15-16, 2001; Cost = $1,800. (http://www.insightful.com/train/ripley.htm)
4. "Tools for Discovering Patterns in Data: A Survey of Modern Data Mining Algorithms" - John Elder (of Elder Research); to be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 16-17, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.datamininglab.com/newcourse.html)
5. "DATA MINING: LEVEL I - An intensive introduction to methods, applications and resources" - Tony Rathburn (The Modeling Agency); to be held in Dallas, Texas, November 27-28, 2001; Cost = $1,095. (http://www.the-modeling-agency.com/training/dm1.htm)

Vince, I am quite grateful. Thanks for arranging this.

By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus this spring before school lets out?  If not, let's definitely plan on scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Vince,


Two recruiting seminars this week for the Finance Department that may be of
interest to you.

(1)Thursday, November 29:  Evgenia Portniaguina (University of Utah). She is
completing here Ph.D., and is one of their strongest students ever. She is
originally from Russia with a BS in Exploration Geophysics (4.0 GPA), Oil &
Gas Academy, Russia.  She will now speak on a Finanicial Market
MicroStructure topic, but she could be of great interest from the Energy
Institute point of view.  Her seminar is in Room 256, Melcher Hall,
10:30 -12 noon.

(2) Friday, November 30:  Peter Carr, Adjunct Professor at Courant
Institute, NYU...His specialization is in derivatives (although he will talk
on "Hedging with Incomplete Markets"). His talk is also in Room 256, 1:30-3
p.m.


Best,

Praveen

Subject:	RE: Sparks Consulting

Vince,

my concerns exactly about revealing pricing approaches.  Sparks is primarily a fundamentals/data shop.  They do not do any statistical modeling at all, as far as I can tell from discussions until this point.  We have already used a lot of information from USDA, which seem to be more statistically sophisticated, at least in the research they sponsor.  The worry would be that Sparks would get more info out of us to use in their consulting activities than we would from them.  I would like to keep the discussions at an exploratory level, where we do not say exactly what we do, and we have them propose alternatives.

Also, I am taking the CFA Level 3 exam on Saturday, so travelling on Friday would be inconvenient for me.  Any later date is better for me, if possible.

the scope of what we shall reveal.

We can shoot ourselves in the foot if we reveal our pricing technology to
consultants.

As we discussed, they have offered to help us with our forward curve development and would like to meet with us next Friday in Memphis.  The key point of contact there is Dr. Rob Murphy.

However, if you have not had a chance to sit down with these employees and discuss their performance and objectives for the next six months, please do so in the near future so that the employee will have ample opportunity to make the necessary adjustments and/ or complete their 6 month objectives.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Thanks in advance for your help
Anne,

Dear Mr. Strickland,
We co-operate with EPRM, and  publish a few of their articles from time to
time on our web. Currently I  am looking for stories in any of the following
areas;
* Back office  management
* Technical analysis, Power analysis
* Financial power  trading
* Power derivatives
Dawn Briddon at EPRM mentioned that a  few contributory articles provided by
you cover these areas, however she  can not pass these articles on without
prior consent.
Would it be ok for  us to publish these articles?
Most sincerely
Ralf  Larsson
Partner & Web  Manager

Vince,

Thanks for the title and outline of your seminar.  I understand that
you must be pretty tied up at this time.  As for your visit, I will
pick you up at the Atlanta airport.  I will meet you at the exit of
the escalator.  Please remind me of you airline and flight number.  I'll
have my cellphone with me (678-637-8303).  One of my colleagues and I will
take you to dinner in the evening.  Your schedule on Thurs. is as follows.

I'll pick you up at the hotel around 9:30.  We will have an informal
meeting with one of my students from 9:50 to 10:50.  She will present
to you some ideas that we have been looking at on bandwidth trading.  We
are expecting to get some comments and feedbacks from you.  Your seminar
will be from 11am to 12noon.  Dr. Bob Kertz (our QCF program
director) will take you to lunch after the talk.  After the lunch, I
arrange you to meet with our students from 2pm to 3pm.  The time slot 3pm
to 4pm is open.  We will arrange a cab to get you at around 4pm.

I look forward to your visit.

Shijie

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

  Contact information:
e-mail:   gdarrah@bigfoot.com
phone:    713.668.4277
cell:     713.320.5615

Thanks,
Glenn Darrah

I just wanted to let you know that I am going to start working on a couple of projects for your group as a result of yesterday's meeting.

1)	Establish a Toastmasters "club" at Enron in order to give the members of your team, as well as other employees, the opportunity to be proactive in developing their leadership and presentation skills.
?	Yesterday I learned that we do have Toastmasters here at Enron that meets on Thursday at lunch.  I am scheduling a meeting with the lead and will report back to you as to whether another club that would meet at a different day/ time (perhaps in the evening) would be successful, and how we can more effectively market this program. 

2)	Continue to work with our organizational development and training team to develop a specialized program that will address the following needs:  ESL, effective communication, presentation skills, and selling/ networking skills.  Currently we are sponsoring an ESL class a group in Networks group, but I would like to try and take that concept further so that your specific needs can be adequately addressed.  

If you think that there are any other areas that I can focus on, please do not hesitate to let me know.  

Thanks,
Anne

Mark,

The members of my group attend INFORMS conferences
and I shall check today if we are covering this specific
meeting.

We shall be glad to speak with Dr. O'Hara when he comes to Houston.
I shall be gone on Friday, but you can contact Sandeep Kohli in Houston to discuss the details.
Any date in the time interval given by you works for us.

Subject:	Boltzmann Model Demonstration from Toshiba in Tokyo
Importance:	High

Vince,

Enron Japan received a presentation today from a nuclear physicist working for Toshiba who has developed an application of the Boltzmann model to finance.  We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Group's Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html

Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.

Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 

Regards,
Mark Brady

Vince,

I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.

I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.

thanks.

Thank you very much for sparing your time with me, yesterday, and explaining

intriguing.

I have revised my resume and have added information regarding the actual
systems and projects which I have worked on both for Salomon Brothers and
Toshiba.  I have attached a list of publication also.

Please feel free to let me know if you need further information.

I will await for a feedback from you, regarding where I might fit in within
the Enron organization.

Best Regards
Niki

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Correction to the last message...

The Colloquium at 3:00 PM on Tuesday, Sept. 25 will be:

COLLOQUIUM TITLE
My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
Adventures on Wall St
Nigel Goldenfeld
Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
1110 West Green St
Urbana
IL 61801
http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel

Abstract
Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
employers of physicists? What is the
quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
might academic physicists gain
experience of real world applications? And
why bother? I discuss these and
other questions in light of my own
experience, starting a software company
to market ultra-fast tools for risk
management of derivative securities.







Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in "Econophysics."  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an "Econophysics" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

On Monday August 6, about 75 new full-time Associates will be starting thei=
r careers at Enron.  Attached is a schedule of Orientation Topics, as well =
as an invitation to welcome these Associates at a Happy Hour Monday evening=
.  It would be great if you could stop by, even for just a few minutes, to =
welcome them to the company.  For your convenience, the Happy Hour is at Fa=
rrago, which is less than 6 blocks from the Enron Building.  =20

Members of the Program regularly tell us that senior level interaction is a=
n area that we can improve on, so your participation in events like this ve=
ry important.  An RSVP is not required, but if you plan to attend, please l=
et us know so we can prepare a name tag for you.  Feel free to extend this =
invitation to other senior members of your team.

As always, we appreciate your continued support of The Program.

Vince, you may remember me as the writer who helped on the natural gas chapter for the Risk Management book. As you know, I work for Enron full-time as a writer of many articles and publications.

I will be in Houston next week and I wondered if you had a half hour on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday to talk about market trends. I'm also available until 11 a.m. on Thursday.

Thanks,
Jeannie

Tricia,

Thanks a lot for your message. I am glad things are going well for you. It's quite hectic here

Hi Vince,

I hope all is well with you!

As for my coordinates.....I am trading (position trading--
futures)....primarily soybeans, 30-year bonds, swiss franc,
and British Pound......I observe the charts after the markets close...put in
my orders accordingly .....and sit and wait for
confirmation and/or for stop orders to be elected....:)...I continue
watching the gold charts.....eventually, that market will
wake up again!   Vince, I am curious of your fundamental analysis of the
currency, and/or equity markets...

Since most of my chart analysis is performed after the markets close....I
have extra time to explore other business opportunities.....at this time, I
am working on a initiative, to import nurses from India to the U.S.!  A
friend of mine, from New Delhi, has asked that I work with her on this
project.  She is talking w/Duke University, as well as the University of
North Carolina Nursing School to collaborate w/her, in India, and provide
their curriculum in India....We are talking to hospitals throughout the
U.S., and are finding an interest in Indian recruits.  Of the foreign nurses
now entering the U.S., the majority are Filipinos.  Did you know about the
shortage of nurses here in the U.S.?

Hello to Mike.....and also....How is Maureen?

Keep in touch......Anytime, you stop in Chicago, call me...312-643-1910....I
live very close to the Enron office on Michigan Avenue..

Take care,
Tricia

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Louise,

Jim Fallon told to wait for explicit intructions from him
before any transfer to NETCO takes place. He is my current boss.

I am afraid we are caught up in a legal mess here. All I need 
is a formal letter or an E-mail. Another alternative is to extend 
employment of some of my guys who are supposed to help with the transistion.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale S=
ervices.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos=
e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit=
s:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat=
ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri=
sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over=
see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the =
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=
 closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem=
ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an=
d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing ("GS=
S") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en=
list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w=
ill focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr=
avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju=
stments.

?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the =
travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=
 have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa=
te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T=
he first is Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP"), or the GSS-approved preferre=
d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed =
online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro=
n.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri=
p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re=
asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic=
kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for =
their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry =
data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave=
l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking=
, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o=
f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click=
Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft=
er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio=
ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
=20
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=
 United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce=
nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=
 a $100 fee.

?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n=
umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=
 unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i=
ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.=
) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl=
e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel=
.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p=
ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001=
.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 =
tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, =
and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr=
oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape=
r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu=
ghout the world. =20

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica=
l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil=
lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of =
customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a=
nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor=
dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=
 Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=
 a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=
 a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye=
ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin=
ated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with =
volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed =
a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio=
n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a =
two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility=
.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=
 a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t=
he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a=
n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a=
nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=
 trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR=
, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand=
ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Tropigas").  Upon co=
mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla=
yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha=
re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P=
rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S=
JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib=
e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p=
ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr=
otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t=
he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc=
es.=20

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the=
m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova=
tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t=
he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch=
icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals =
with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  =
To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look=
ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes=
ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua=
rter! =20

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea=
rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs=
day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=
 revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up =
from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu=
arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart=
er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar=
ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some =
terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin=
ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng=
th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q=
uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in =
Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co=
mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=
 per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum=
es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th=
e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue=
/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=
 power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in =
the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The =
growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, =
however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T=
Wh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=
 and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos=
ing of EES' first, major "marquis" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit=
h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's=
 business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. =
 The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel=
opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m=
ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct=
 Canada. =20

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o=
f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En=
ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read=
ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public=
ations.  =20

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea=
r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo=
pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i=
n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs=
uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant=
 expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der=
ivatives.=20

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre=
ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ=
essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto=
ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water =
concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet=
 another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o=
f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T=
he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o=
f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup=
ply contract through 2010. =20

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased =
volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart=
er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 =
million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po=
sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share =
of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje=
ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline =
deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met=
als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten=
-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets=
, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac=
tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin=
g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a=
cross Enron.  =20

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'=
ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through=
 end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh=
en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter=
, "Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, n=
early double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the =
size of the US." =20

 Dear Dr. Kaminski

 We have talked earlier during your energy class at Rice about career
opportunities in risk management at Enron. If it is possible, I would like
to meet with you and people from your group next week, preferably Tuesday
(May 8). My time is flexible, I could come any time. Other days are also
fine.

 Thank you very much in advance.

I have just had  confirmation of your acceptance as a Securities and Financ=

be maintained on your SFA file here in Compliance - please let me know if y=
ou would like a copy for your own records (are you still in London?)

Please note that any future events that may effect your registration status=
 (change of departments, job change/promotion etc) should be discussed in t=
he first place, with your immediate supervisor to see whether your existing=
 registration is sufficient for your new role.  Registration as an SFDR all=
ows you to carry out the duties of a registered representative in relation =
to any investment or security for which Enron has been authorised by the SF=
A with the exception of commodity derivatives.  If you did move to one of t=
he commodity desks based within the UK, then you would need to upgrade your=
 registration by passing the 'commodity derivatives' module and becoming a =
General Representative.  If doubt remains please contact either myself or J=
onathan Marsh (SFA Compliance Officer) for further advice.  Other factors s=

ion and character (please see the attachments to this message), transfer to=
 a different Enron office etc should be advised to Jonathan Marsh (SFA Comp=
liance Officer) or me as soon as practicable.

As your registration was the result of a transfer, I would be grateful if y=
ou could complete the attached qusetionnaire relating to your 'good reputat=

Praveen,

I shall try to attend Peter Carr's seminar. Of course, given the level of
turbulence we have been experiencing my plans may change
on a very short notice.
We can chat for a few minutes before or after the seminar about
my association with UofH.

Vince,


Two recruiting seminars this week for the Finance Department that may be of
interest to you.

(1)Thursday, November 29:  Evgenia Portniaguina (University of Utah). She is
completing here Ph.D., and is one of their strongest students ever. She is
originally from Russia with a BS in Exploration Geophysics (4.0 GPA), Oil &
Gas Academy, Russia.  She will now speak on a Finanicial Market
MicroStructure topic, but she could be of great interest from the Energy
Institute point of view.  Her seminar is in Room 256, Melcher Hall,
10:30 -12 noon.

(2) Friday, November 30:  Peter Carr, Adjunct Professor at Courant
Institute, NYU...His specialization is in derivatives (although he will talk
on "Hedging with Incomplete Markets"). His talk is also in Room 256, 1:30-3
p.m.


Best,

Praveen

Hello Darrell,

Hi,

	How are you?  Just a brief note to let you know that I followed up on the letter (dated May 2nd) to Dr. Ken Lay from the President of Howard University.

	I spoke with President Swygert and Dr. Hassan Minor about how Enron may assist Howard University in structuring a new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Center (ISE).

	I was informed that Howard will be forwarding further details onto Dr. Lay and me as to how Enron can help them move forward with the development of the ISE.

	Will keep you posted.

Kind regards,
Iris

To all:

The latest paper from Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute is very, very good. This is an excellent analysis and even goes into market microstructure. Nevertheless, no one bats a hundred. These two overlook the critical role that long-term markets (swaps and option structures) can (and I think, must) play in creating a new market regime.

More on my criticisms later. In the mean time, check out:

Dear Dr. V. Kaminsky and other Enron?s colleagues,

I have a good time for the significant discussions with you. I believe that th
e collaboration with Enron and TOSHIBA-PIC brings many benefits to every field
. Now, the activity of financial technology moves to the field of energy tradi
ng. If our collaboration becomes active, the financial technology will progres
s more drastically. Enron and PIC have many key technologies for the success o
f our collaboration.

Thank you for your deep understanding of Boltzmann model and your hospitality.


Best regards,
Yuji Uenohara

Hello Vince,

It was good to talk with you yesterday. David Rowe and I will be happy to
meet with you for breakfast at 7:00 on Tuesday. I will call on Monday to
set the location.

The URL for our commodity option calculator demonstration is

	http://perun.otci.net/Utility

Note that several of the data sets, which we obtain daily from NYMEX, are
incomplete. NG, HO, CN, NT and CL have enough data to indicate performance.
The others are either missing altogether or the series is too short to be
useful.

If you want to see the currency demonstration, it is at

	http://perun.otci.net/BC

and includes some technical material describing work we did in creating the
site.

With best regards,

Subject:	RE: Pricing of restriction on Enron stock

Vince,
I just spoke with Rakesh.  I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and I'm certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince.
Ron

Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the Enron's point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.  Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

Vince,

As I mentioned in my voice mail, Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody, a recent MBA grad from Rice, into his group.  However, when we were talking about this position, Mike compared Sara to Elena.  Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also.  Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work.  

I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.  If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K).  Please advise.

Thanks,
Anne

		What's New at ERisk.com - 07 December 2001	


		
Weekly Review	In this week's round-up   of economic, banking and insurance industry news from an enterprise risk  management perspective: US stocks finally enjoy a tech-led rally; Enron's  bankruptcy opens up new questions on audit as banks count up their exposures;  the Fed reassures on systemic risk; Merrill Lynch settles with Unilever;  AIG's Greenberg warns on terrorism coverage; Equitas ups reserves to  cope with asbestos claims.	
Analysis 	 Rates  for property & casualty (P&C) insurance have hardened dramatically  since September 11, and terrorism coverage is likely to be excluded from  many policies from early next year. Is this the opportunity   that alternative risk transfer (ART) needs to take root in the market?  Or are potential clients still wary of applying capital markets techniques  to what have traditionally been seen as insurable risks? 	
iConference	Our  next iConference, "Selecting and Evaluating Credit Risk Models",  takes place on December 11 at 1200 Eastern Time (1700 GMT). Craig Friedman  and Robert Cangemi of Standard & Poor's will present a strategic view  of the main issues for senior managers and offer the latest thinking on  some quantitative pitfalls. Sponsored by ICICIresearchcentre.org ,  this free, hour-long event is essential for anyone charged with selecting  a credit risk methodology. Click here   to register.	
Feature	As  Enron's experience testifies, killer risks can slip through even a sophisticated  enterprise risk management programme. As Alan McNee finds in our latest  feature ,  "Who Watches The Watchmen?", tightening the net involves looking  again at the roles of risk management and internal audit.  Still available: "Risk  Management in the Digital Age" , by Rick Davis of DigitalRisk Advisors	
Bookstore	Our featured book   this month is "The Chastening: Inside The Crisis that Rocked the Global  Financial System and Humbled the IMF" by Paul Blustein. Washington  Post writer Blustein looks at the inner workings of the regulators of  the international monetary system during the 1997-8 financial crisis in  the Far East that later spread around the world. And it isn't pretty reading.   Still available: November's featured book ,  "Operational Risk - Measurement and Modelling", by Jack L.King,  and October's featured book ,  "Fooled by Randomness", by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

>ABSTRACT:
> Based on the peculiarities of electricity as underlying
> commodity of forward contracts we develop a time-continuous
> pricing model for short-term electricity forwards. The suggested
> stochastic volatility model utilizes the non-tradeable spot
> price of electricity and its variance rate as state variables.
> This enables us to capture the non-linearities, and the high and
> time varying volatility seen in electricity prices. Using
> maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filtering we
> report empirical results on electricity data from the
> Californian market.

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader
> proprietary positions to their market making activities. In
> particular, we examine interdealer trading, its function as an
> inventory management tool, and its costs. In addition, we
> develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy, where some floor
> traders, who are more successful, profit from their trades with
> other dealers. On average, we find that dealers earn relative
> profits when they execute position reducing trades. However, a
> surprising finding is that more successful traders are more
> likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades,
> which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer
> hierarchy. The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster
> and Mann's 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory
> control, and Reiss and Werner's 1998 article on interdealer
> trading. The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits
> from the elaborate futures data, and the highly competitive
> nature of dealer trading on the floor.

>ABSTRACT:
> The paper assumes that the implied volatility of options with
> some given expiration is a quadratic function of the moneyness.
> The coefficients of this quadratic function (the smile) are time
> dependent and stochastic. The paper derives exposure parameters
> of the price of the option to the local change in each of the
> smile coefficients, and an approximate formula for their risk
> adjusted expected value. These are important in managing the
> exposure of the price of an option portfolio to changes in the
> smile coefficients.

>ABSTRACT:
> We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative
> by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option
> portfolios (buy the option and hedge with stock). Within a
> stochastic volatility framework, we demonstrate a correspondence
> between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium
> and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns. Using a sample of
> S&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the
> following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy
> underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is
> less for options away from the money. Third, the
> underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility.
> Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects
> delta-hedged gains even after accounting for jump-fears. Our
> evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk
> premium.

>ABSTRACT:
> In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer
> investors a superior risk-return trade-off. We do so using a
> continuous time version of Dybvig's (1988a, 1988b) payoff
> distribution pricing model. The evaluation model, which does not
> require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution
> of the funds in question, is applied to the monthly returns of
> 77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May
> 1990-April 2000. The results show that as a stand-alone
> investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return
> profile. We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be
> inefficient, with the average efficiency loss amounting to 2.76%
> per annum for indices and 6.42% for individual funds. Part of
> the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified
> away. Funds of funds, however, are not the preferred vehicle for
> this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their
> double fee structure. Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio
> context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation
> outcomes. Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72
> individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone
> basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when
> mixed with the S&P 500. The best results are obtained when
> 10-20% of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds

Hi again,

	As, I stated is a prior emails, the contact details for the RiskCalc folks are as follows:

1.  Marc Brammer
Director of Strategic Sales
tel:  800.523.2627, x5706
mbrammer@MoodysRMS.com

2. Neal Clark
Vice President
Tel:  800.523.2627, x5701
nclark@MoodysRMS.com

	Neal said that he would be willing to set up a meeting between us and their quants to better understand their model, the various inputs and whether or not the model can be tweaked for less than the 17 specified inputs.

	Let me know if you guys wish to have Neal set up a conference between Moody's quants and Enron folks in Houston and London.


Ciao,
Iris

Iris/Amitava,

I may have already said this, but we've had so many e-mails and telephone calls flying back and forth that I wanted to make sure I at least got this much out to you.  Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they'll tell) and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model may have.  Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model extends to other countries.  I know from a previous conversation with Lea Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American names but they suspect it might extend to other countries.  Conversely, I know they are working efforts within Moody's Risk Management Services to develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions.  One they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe.  Data, as always, was the issue.  See if the quants have any perspective on their success/plan in that area.

Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward pushing off this private model initiative and I'm very confident we'll be able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either D&B and/or Experian data.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi,

	Two RiskCalc sales people made a presentation this week about their product.

	They stated that they could set up a meeting with their quants and our people to discuss the model input and what happens if we have less than 17 inputs.

Ooops... part II.

I just threw out 12 as a number for something we might develop... it's really not based on anything.  We know 17 will work for pre-packaged programs.  We also know there will be a great number of names with less than the full 17... I assume we would pursue another model (internal or external) to provide probably less accurate numbers but at least available for names with fewer inputs.  

Mike

Hi Mike,

	Thanks for your email.

	What do you mean by "buying blind  all major data associated with these specific DUNS numbers"?

	I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields.  I know RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work for less than 17.  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs.  They suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who developed the model.

Regards,
Iris

Iris,

Thanks.

After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.

Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major data associated with these specific DUNS numbers.

Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of which fields, etc.).

Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size, etc.... redoing when more data is purchased.


Any thoughts.



Mike

Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in "Econophysics."  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an "Econophysics" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

Christie,

The schedule for Monday is already full but I shall try to work around it.
I shall call Tom's office if a window opens up on Monday. I assume

Hi Vince,

Just FYI, I'll be at Wharton Monday afternoon to meet with Tom Piazze and Donna Piazze, Monday evening for recruiting reception and then Tuesday to help interview.  I arranged to meet Monday with Tom Piazze at 3pm and Donna Piazze at 4pm.  Do you want to be included by telephone for the 3 and 4 pm meetings??  If you'd like, we can call your office from Tom Piazze's office.

Let me know and travel safely!!

Best regards!

ABSTRACT:
 Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a
 measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk,
 are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve
 discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in
 applications because of the prevalence of models based on
 scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able
 to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is
 coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through
 linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale
 calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical
 efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several
 case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index
 tracking.

 Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean
 shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,
 hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management

Vince,

Here is your presentation on the exotic energy options with slightly modifications.
I added a few slides about Asian options and spread options. I used the Asian strip options as an
transition technique for the forward curve modeling.  For the weather presentation
I did a summary at the end. From the audience responses, it seemed the presentations
went well.

Would you please launch an effort with the research group (not fundamentals) to build an options valuation model for the crude basket. Assume 100 MBD on average and 25 MBD of each class of crude. So we have the option of substituting any grade within the class of crudes. They may not have enough data to value them. Thanks.

Subject:	Crude Oil for Oz

As outlined in the Oz MOU, we will be supplying a basket of crudes at fixed differentials to WTI. To simplify the process of negotiating these diffs, we have established 4 classes of crude and picked a marker for each group. We need to come up with our offer for each of these markers (vs Calendar Nymex WTI) on a delivered basis. The crude classes and marker for each are as follows:

Class		Marker Crude

Light Sweet	Domestic Sweet
Heavy Sweet	Cabinda
Light Sour	Basrah Light
Heavy Sour	Maya

These were chosen based on an assumption that they are the most liquid grades for each class. We could probably use Mesa 30 instead of Bas Lt for the Lt Sour. Pat, if you want to do that just please call Quinn to make sure it works for him. Your call on what you think is the most liquid.

Once we have an offer for each of the markers, we will then set net diffs for all the other crudes by using a relative refining value of each grade relative to it's marker (and add the RV diff to the marker delivered diff). This will avoid us having to derive a forward market-based offer for each grade, using RRV instead. It will also establish diffs at which the refy will be indifferent on which grade is supplied. The preliminary list of approved crudes and their class are listed on the attached spreadsheet. (Please let me know if you want to add any crudes.)

I need your help with the following:

1) Work up an "FOB" offer for each grade on an 8 year basis, and assuming approximate size of 25MBD for each grade. It might be good to see if Jen's group can help with a fundamental angle on value for these grades (pls work through John if you want this as he has been asked to coordinate the Oz/Fraser connection).

2) We will work with you to structure net delivered numbers to the refinery. There are a number of costs that will need to get loaded into the bridge cost. Yolanda is verifying w/ops a lot of bridge costs that we got from Farmland. Pat or Don, please also feel free to look at the list (Yolanda has) and let us know if you have any comments. In add'n to those costs, we will need to add: a) backwardation between your FOB price basis and Cal Nymex, b) time value of money, c) linefill costs, d) tank rental costs (Fland rents breakout/blending tanks at Cush), e) Brent/WTI on Bas Lt and Cabinda, f) Freight (Joe - I am assuming you will make a market for the crude guys on the cargo movements - the WS rates on the attd sheet are out of date but you may find the template handy).


I NEED TO HAVE YOUR FOB OFFERS AND FREIGHT BY FIRST THING MONDAY PLEASE.

We will then circle up and work into the net number with you (let you check our spreadsheet for del'd costs).

I would have preferred to cover in person but will not be in in the AM.

Thanks!!

Good Morning Vince,
 
Wiley & sons publishing asked me if there were  people that I knew that were famous and intelligent to send the preprinting book  to for the purpose of getting an endorsing comment to put on the cover. Would  you be interested in doing so?
 
Secondly, it has been suggested to me to do some  teaching of investments at the University of Houston. Do you know any names from  over there and does Pravine Kumar ring a bell?
 
Let's get together sometime.
 
Steve

Liz, Greg:

Frank Wolak from Stanford will be back in the office on Tuesday,
August 7. I hope to set up a meeting with him and then to finalize
the meeting with Prediction Co.  I shall be shooting for August 23 - 24,
in view of Greg's trip on the 15th and 16th.

I left a message for Norman Packard, telling him that I should be  able
to get back to him regarding the trip to Santa Fe by Tuesday this week.

The first draft of the non-disclosure agreement will be ready by Tuesday
or Wednesday.

Have a good trip.

Vince

Frank,

Greg Whalley and I are planning another trip to a California.
The trip is most likely to take place on the 16th - 17th of August
or a week later (23rd - 24th of August). Are you available for an afternoon
meeting and / or dinner on Thursday, August 16 or August 23? 

We are very interested in your thoughts about the directions of the power 
markets across the US.

Vince Kaminski

Michael,

To follow up on my first message, I want to inform you that I decided
to appear before the SEC investigators without a legal counsel. I simply feel
that your highly competent help is not required in my case.

I want to thank you for the time you spent with me on Wednesday.
My only regret is that I shall have no opportunity to spend more time
with you and learn from your experience.


Vince

As of 8:00 am this morning, EWS had reached $1,204,056 in pledges, which is 94.36% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000 and our participation rate is 65.39%.  Needless to say, the campaign will continue for a few more days in order to reach 100% of the Enron goal.

If employees are having problems with the system, have them call or e-mail me with their pledge.  I can do it for them.  They will receive a confirmatory e-mail, which they can use to check for accuracy.

Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by business unit/functional group:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
	EA			$202,713	68.06%
	EBS			$157,800	38.95%
	EEOS			$74,949		90.02%
	EEL			$36,846		65.22%
	EGM			$164,680	72.65%
	EIM			$93,372		79.58%
	ENW			$251,225	63.75%
	EWS Bus. Analysis	$39,723		99.08%
	EWS Bus. Dev.		$16,538		100.00%
	EWS HR		$20,009		76.06%
	EWS Legal		$68,367		86.96%
	EWS Research		$24,853		95.65%
	EWS Treasury		$17,981		100.00%

From a corporate perspective, EWS remains in 1st place in % of goal reached and is now in LAST place in participation rate.  Here are the other groups' totals:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation		% of Goal
	ETS			$291,399	89.87%			84.22%
	Corporate		$719,772	67.44%			91.69%
	EES			$424,616	67.70%			86.13%
	Enron-wide		$2,639,844	68.40%			91.03%

 a user can quickly compare the output of up to 4 weather forecasting model=

ns, you can compare all 14 weather forecasts side-by-side either to gain st=
atistical confidence in a particular outcome or to quantify the weather ris=
k of a specific forecast.  If you rely on weather forecasts, you should be =
aware of the extent to which all 14 forecasts agree (or disagree) with each=
 other. For an example, visit Syncrasy's  Forecast Analysis and Confidence =
Trading System (FACTS)?  on our website.   WHICH WEATHER FORECAST IS MORE A=
CCURATE?  Discover which weather forecast has been historically the most ac=

temperatures change more than 10 degrees within an hour.  For an example, s=

themselves by comparing our time stamps to that of their best alternative w=

t is available on Syncrasy's system (timestamp in dark green) as well as th=
e anticipated time the weather forecast should update (timestamp in black).=
 Users will find our data reports FIRST offering them a valuable competitiv=

 Weather Analysis Tool (SWAT?  SWAT? collects timely and comprehensive  met=
eorologically diverse weather forecasts   from multiple forecasting groups,=
 such as National Weather Service, universities, armed services, NASA and o=
ther research oriented institutions.  The data is integrated into a single =
analysis platform.  This platform includes a number of tools which may be u=
seful to a trader and/or meteorologist.  For example, SWAT? assists users i=
n the following tasks:  identifying and quantifying weather risk for some f=
uture time period; tracking the historical performance of different weather=
 forecasting methodologies; and, creating a proprietary forecast.   SWAT?cu=

Matt,

I am sending you as promised the PowerPoint presentations about different units
of the Research Group. As you know, the current plan is to transfer 4 meteorologists from
my group and 2 pure quants to the new company. I have no commitments from the pure
quant side at this point, so I cannot give you any specific names.

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Apropos to the questions in today's talk:
 
(1) whether a random variable X, a Multivariate T distribution, = bZ (where b is a univariate r.v =sqrt(v/y), and y is 
a chi-square distribution with v degrees of freedom), can be correlationless, attached below is a succinct proof.

(2) One might think that since we are multiplying 2 random variables (i.e., Z is 2 dimensional) by the same scalar random variable (i.e., b), then the resultant random variables would tend to rise and fall together, and hence necessarily be linearly correlated.  However, as is shown below, if Z is uncorrelated, then X is uncorrelated.

Please note, our approach is analagous, but not identical to the Glasserman and Co papers (distributed to Research).  Glasserman computes the characteristic function of the Pr(P/L > x), so to compute the entire P&L pdf he would have to repeat the procedure for every value of x.  We circumvent that iterative approach (with the messy characteristic function) and compute the pdf in one shot.
Please note, we are not comparing full reval vs. delta-gamma at all, that is a completely different story.


Naveen

The NY ISO posts hourly tie flows for the previous month (and earlier).  Th=
at would provide an excellent opportunity for calibration.  Once field prov=
en, such monitoring would be useful.  ERCOT tie flows are not generally pos=

after the month is over.  I think there would be great value for this info =

Greetings Vince!
=09During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been ponde=
ring yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written=
 programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current l=
ines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these l=
ines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two be=
tween WSCC and SPP.  It would seem to me to be valuable to know when there =
there power supply differences between these NERC regions and when power wa=
s flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For =
once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, th=
e project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in =
the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolita=
n cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being for=
med - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese syst=
em and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect i=
nternally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and=
 power control differences between each of the generating countries.
=09You are the first person that I have told about this.  I didn't want to =
get anyone, especially my immediate supervisors, excited about a technology=
 that I wasn't ready to provide.  I know that once I say that we could do i=
t, the powers that be will want it NOW.  If you think that there is a marke=
t for this imformation I'll sneak out some weekend and collect a bit of dat=
a.  The nearest HVDC inter-tie is just north of Dallas so testing it would =
only take a day or two.  I am currently juggling two running chainsaws, a r=
abid dog and three vial of hepatitis so one more item in the mix won't make=
 much of a difference at this point.  If no one needs to info, I'll just pu=
t the hardware and software on the shelf.

p.s.  Gina and I would like to take you out to lunch or dinner soon to a Sa=
rdinian restaurant.  Let us know when you would be free.  ( Your wife is in=
vited, of course!)

Gentlemen,

I woke up early as usual and wanted to help you, but the management had 
other plans.....

In the emotion of the moment last Friday, I was too choked up to say much, 
so let me try to make some amends this morning.  Of course, I hope to get 
together with you guys some day soon, but until then I'd like to say a 
couple of things.

The Weather Team was one of the best, most competent groups within Enron.  
It compared nationally with "major-league" meteorology, both public and 
private.  To break this team up is a serious offense to science.  I was 
proud to be a part of it, learning and growing personally and 
professionally.

I don't see how any job I find from here on out will compare to it.  The 
Research Group in general was the finest collection of minds and talent I've 
ever seen.  Vince chose them very carefully.  I just sort of wormed my way 
in, but I was practicing hard while sitting on the bench waiting for my 
chance to prove something.

And, perhaps more importantly, I have gained new friends. If there's 
anything you guys need, let me know.

Mike, as the rest of you know, has an amazing talent for bringing out the 
best in people.  As he told me Friday, I have indeed grown in the past two 
years.  The credit for much of it goes to Mike, who lives the philosophy 
that we called Enron.  Pity that some of the executives didn't.

I could ramble on for a while about this, but I won't bore you with it.  I 
just wanted to say that y'all are the best!  I'd appreciate an occasional 
e-mail if you hear some interesting company news.  Of course, I want to 
immediately know what happens to each of you.

Kevin, you need to get that home e-mail going buddy!

I'll keep you posted on my job hunt if I turn up anything.

You'll hear from me again! :-)

Sam

Subject:	Valuation Methodology

We've had a request from AA to provide them with some sort of write-up or documentation from our research group on the valuation methodology used on the contingent issuance instrument for 18 million shares that was a part of the Raptor transaction completed at the end of March.  Apparently, this request has come from AA's expert in this area (I believe that his name is Dechundra, or something like that.  I've probably destroyed the spelling on that.  You guys are probably very familiar with him.)  Anyway, is there such documentation that we can provide them easily?  If so, let me know so that we can try to get AA finished with their review of the transaction.  In talking to our contacts at AA, I believe that their expert will be wanting to talk to you after he reviews the methodology documentation.  Thanks,
Ron

Vince,
I am writing in regards to an energy derivatives training course I am
developing.  I would like to invite you to be an instructor for the course.
A preliminary agenda is attached.  Brett Humphreys from Risk Capital
Management is teaching on Day One, and I was wondering if you would be
interested in covering all or part of Day Two.  The topics outlined here can
be modified based on your feedback.

Our training courses are structured for an interactive, classroom-type
setting.  We limit the audience to 25 people and bring in 2-3 instructors to
cover the material over the course of two days.

I will follow up but please let me know what you think.

Jeannie,

Here are some clips from the suit that I found.  Let me know if you are thinking of something else.  Thanks, A.


MARKETPLACE
ENRON PAYS TVA $200-MILLION TO END SUIT CLAIMING MARKETER BREACHED SALES DEAL

03/05/2001
Power Markets Week
10
Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill. Reproduction forbidden without permission.

The Tennessee Valley Authority said it received more than $200-million from Enron from a January lawsuit settlement involving Enron's alleged failure to meet the terms of an option sales contracts with TVA during summer and winter peaking periods since 1998. 
TVA revealed the gain from the settlement Feb. 27 in a quarterly financial report.
The two sides would not comment further on the deal that appears to settle the TVA lawsuit and a countersuit from Enron that had been filed in Federal District Court in Chattanooga in early 1999, nor would they discuss the terms of the settlement. 
The settlement may end a series of disputes between Enron and TVA which began in 1995 when Enron signed a 10-year options contract to supply peaking power to TVA starting in 1998. The size of the contract was never disclosed but it was believed to cover up to 1,400 MW. Enron quickly built four gas-fired combustion turbine units in the region totaling 1,850 MW and set up its own control area inside the TVA territory to give itself more flexibility to use the turbines to either supply TVA or trade for outside supplies. 
However, in 1999 problems arose when Enron said it was unable to get sufficient transmission capacity from TVA to make the control area work. And in early 2000, Enron charged that TVA was slow to respond to transmission service requests for the merchant plants in its territory, hampering the supplier's ability to market the power if TVA didn't use it. 
TVA, though, said Enron was purposely jamming its transmission system for competitive reasons. TVA also began an aggressive campaign to build its own combustion turbine projects in the region and meet peaking needs through its in-house production, using less on the Enron capacity which it said was unreliable. 
The transmission dispute led to the TVA lawsuit, in which the utility charged that Enron failed to deliver energy under the agreements during summer peak periods forcing it to buy replacement power at higher costs. It made several requests to the court for compensation for specific replacement power costs through early 2000. 
Enron and TVA officials would not say whether the original options contract between them was still in effect. or was terminated as part of the settlement. TVA also currently has several RFP's pending for new independent power supplies for both short term and long term periods.

BRIEFS
TVA WINS $200M FROM ENRON

03/05/2001
Southeast Power Report

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The Tennessee Valley Authority has revealed that it received ``in excess of $200-million'' from Enron in January 2001 as part of a lawsuit settlement involving Enron's alleged failure to meet the terms of a power sales contract during the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
TVA said in a Feb. 27 quarterly financial report that it would use the proceeds from the settlement for debt reduction.
The two sides would not comment further on the TVA lawsuit, the settlement, or a countersuit from Enron that had been filed in Federal District Court in Chattanooga in 1999.

Subject:	invitations to presentation only

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

"Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, "Ivy Ghose" <ghosei@rice.edu>, "Luigi Calabrese" <luigical@rice.edu>, "Pravas Sud" <pravas@rice.edu>, "Syed \(Farhan\) Iqbal" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

FYI,

We need to get to at least 80%.

I am also talking to Erik Thode: I am 
afraid he has a list of the group distorted by the summer
employees who cannot contribute even
if they want to (they are not in the system).

Mr. Lay has just announced an offsite for the Policy Committee from Sept. 6 through Sept. 9.  Greg will have to attend this offsite.  Also, Greg leaves today at Noon for a trip w/Mr. Lay.  He will be unavailable for a conference call on tomorrow.  I'll get w/Greg and talk about alternative dates.

Liz,

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
Mark Taylor, as well.

Given Greg Whalley's schedule, the best day for us to visit with you at Santa Fe
would be Wednesday, September the 5th. WE would arrive from San Francisco, early in the morning
and we could stay through the day.

Please, let me know if this date would work for you.

Subject:	Market Stack


Vince,
 
Henwood is in the process of developing a new  product that, for lack of a better name, we are calling Market Stack.  The  purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without  the hassle of a full-blown simulation.  The software would be designed to  allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of  keystrokes.  The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or  region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time  information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage.   
 
At this point in the process we are looking for  ideas (and sponsors).  If you think your traders might be open to the idea,  I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next  week.
 
Please advise.
 
Thanks,
Eric

Hi Joe,

No luck yet. I could not find the issue
you are looking for.
We are reorganizing our group library
and all magazines are in one big pile.
I should know  by Friday if we still have it.

Vince, 
My name is Randy Katz.  We met earlier this fall when you spoke to Dr. Ron's Energy Finance class at the University of Texas-Austin.  I spent my summer working for Lloyd Will on the power floor, and recently accepted an offer to return to Enron full-time as an associate.
Obviously, I've watched the events of the last few weeks very carefully, and I am wondering if you can provide any perspective on what's happened.  In addition, though I know this will be difficult, I'd be interested to know your views on the future of the combined entity.
I respect your opinions, and look forward to hearing from you soon.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
EGM's global crude and products group closed its largest trades to date wit=
h EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EOT) on June 29,2001.  Enron Gas Liquid=
s, Inc. ("EGLI") is the counterparty to a 10-year toll conversion agreement=
 and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation=
.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of=
 feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into=
 various offtake products, primarily MTBE.=20

As a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to conve=
rt the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's =
sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regu=
latory risk associated with the MTBE market.

Prior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreement=
s, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbo=
n-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid =
system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicat=
ed on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT. =20

These combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.

EGM Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals welcomes Andrew Hill to the Houston office for a six-month=
 assignment from London.  Andrew joined EGM in March as a Senior Specialist=
 and has been instrumental in developing the growing range of EGM Fundament=
als publications such as Critical Mass and The Week Ahead.  In Houston, And=
rew will be working with Richard Lassander to manage analysis of the crude =
and products markets.  Prior to joining EGM, Andrew worked as a management =
consultant specializing in Latin America with Wood McKenzie.

EGM Fundamentals has begun analysis of domestic freight markets.  This new =
effort, managed by Jeff Andrews, is being coordinated with Matt Arnold's fo=
rward trading group in Enron Freight Markets (EFM).  Current analysis is fo=
cused on over-the-road trucking, following the initial commercial focus of =
EFM, and the development of diesel hedging strategies.  Related projects in=
clude modeling the seasonality of trucking demand and diesel fuel consumpti=
on and forecasting on-road diesel prices.  Within the next three to four we=
eks, analysis will begin of the intermodal freight network.  Interested par=
ties should watch the EGM Fundamentals intranet site (<http://egmfundy.corp=
.enron.com>) for updates.

East Power Origination
The Sand Hill Energy Center in Austin was dedicated on Wednesday, July 11th=
 at 10:00 am.  The $93.7 million project is the first peaking facility of i=
ts kind in Texas to be constructed with selective catalytic reduction pollu=
tion control equipment that reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rate =
by 80 percent.  NOx emissions from the units are 5 parts per million (ppm),=
 which is considerably less than the amounts allowed by state and federal r=
egulations.  Congratulations to the development team!

IN THE NEWS

"For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just =
shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement," Enron spok=
esman Mark Palmer said. "They are just interested in creating a whipping po=
st. The last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do =
is take responsibility for the problem they created."  Houston Chronicle, J=
uly 10, 2001.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany=20
Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first ph=
ysical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in=
 Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta=
king gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base=
 load.

In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co=
mpleted a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe=
nt player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected=
 in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had=
 to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German=
y in order to close the gas supply deal.  "Although we are happy that we ha=
ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac=
tual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net=
work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the neg=
otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor=
t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France," commented Carsten H=
aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a=
nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el=
ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran=
sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after =
Ruhrgas. "This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, =
especially in East Germany, " said Haack. "But more importantly, this deal =
will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo=
mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network =
operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!" he added.

ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont
Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a serie=
s of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wi=
lton International.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two milli=
on tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plant=
s. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the prov=
ision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, secu=
rity and emergency response.

Paul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: "Securing an exclusive long-term supply agr=
eement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achi=
evement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current cont=
ract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and =
offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the =
operation of their respective assets."


Enron's Northernmost Partner!
Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger =
Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Var=
anger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partne=
rship will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and=
 the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperat=
ure risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to =
develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian mar=
ket generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second=
 such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.

This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationshi=
ps in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varange=
r has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As =
the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in coop=
eration with Russian partners to manage the water storage.=20

I find the proposal OK.  I think it's premature to get into the support of
conferences and would therefore propose not to include them in the value
proposition at this time.

Although I liked the idea of the levels being tied to energy, I don't like
the titles.  I would like to see some additional options.  I will also put
some thinking into alternatives.

Included is a draft of a proposed fee structure arrangement for the
"partnership membership" in GEMI.  Rather than focusing on discounts and
credits for the certificate fees, we thought the simpler concept would be to

have a certain number of slots provided at no charge for the different
membership levels. We have tried to allow maximum participation in the
seminars and forums but providing a pro-rationing mechanism if needed.   On
conferences, we have suggested discounts which grow in size depending on the

membership level. It would be helpful if you could respond by Dec. 15th if
you like the proposal or have any suggestions.Thanks for taking the time to
review.

Subject:	Collaboration with Enron

Dear Vince,

I just sent this message to you and Christie Patrick, but I believe I had an
incorrect e-mail address for you the first time.  Hopefully this message will
reach you with no problems.

I hope this message finds you both very well!  As you may recall, I will be
working for McKinsey and Company in Seattle starting this fall.  However, my
interest in energy has continued to grow since Wharton's Tiger Team project
with Enron last spring, and I decided to spend the second half of my summer
working in the industry.

I am currently serving as interim Marketing Manager for e-Acumen, a venture-
backed provider of high-end analytics, software, and advisory services to
financial services companies trading weather derivatives and re-insurers
dealing in catastrophic weather risk policies, as well as to power and energy
industry clients.  Our primary investor is GE Power Systems, while some of our
other investors include Woodside Fund, Perseus Capital, CreateLabs, and
NewVista Capital.

I represent the Weather Risk Services group, which provides consensus weather
forecasts--forecasts that consistently beat the National Weather Service
Medium Range Forecast model--to financial, power and energy industry clients,
of which Enron is one. In addition, the group provides load forecasts to many
of the largest power traders in the country.

e-Acumen's newest product, WeatherAcumen, is a quantitative weather risk
platform based on leading edge portfolio optimization analytics and simulation
techniques.  WeatherAcumen mitigates weather risk by more accurately
determining intrinsic values of weather derivatives, and features proprietary
applications of a non-parametric Monte Carlo simulation engine that provides
high fidelity indications of statistical arbitrage opportunities, resulting in
more profitable hedging and trading strategies.

A WeatherAcumen demonstration is scheduled for September 14 with Mark Tawney,
head of the weather desk, as well as Claudio Ribeiro, Joe Hrgovcic, and
Michael Nguyen.   While they will be considering the functional benefits of
such a platform to Enron's weather operations, I wanted to discuss a longer-
term partnership opportunity with you that could benefit Enron from a
marketing and profitability standpoint.

One possible model for collaboration could involve e-Acumen providing a direct
link from the WeatherAcumen platform to EnronOnline in order to drive
increased trading volume to your site.  WeatherAcumen's superior analytics,
industry-leading weather backcasts and forecasts, and proprietary simulation
technology allow weather derivatives, power, and gas traders to have greater
price-discovery capabilities.  Even better, firms trading with a WeatherAcumen-
enabled counterparty will have more confidence in posted prices, and thus be
more willing to trade on your site.  We feel that such a partnership could
very beneficial to both Enron and e-Acumen.

I would appreciate the opportunity to talk with you in person. Please let me
know if there is a convenient time to call you to discuss how we might

John,

Would you like me to use the slides you attached
or expand/replace them with some additional material.

Vince,

I am attaching some powerpoint slides that I have prepared for the EMBAs in
Dallas.  I wanted to share them in the event that you might find them
useful (don't feel the need to use them however as they are self-contained
notes that the students can use independently of your comments).

John McCormack and I will await your arrival at the Cooper Center tomorrow
night before going to dinner.  Shirley sent me your schedule which
indicates your arrival at Love Field at 6:20.  I suspect that you can be at
the Cooper Center by 7:30 so if you will give me a call when you arrive we
can gather together for dinner.

Thanks again for taking the time out of your very busy schedule to help out
in my class.

your friend,

John

p.s. I hope your cross country trip went well.

Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level.

Thank you.

Dear Vince,

I tried to call but your phone was busy. I'm an unofficial advisor to the
White House energy team and they've asked me if Enron's bankruptcy presents
a potential systemic risk. I told them I did not think so.

This is FYI only... as I am unencumbered by the facts, it was only a
judgment call on my part.

Feel free to call me at 781 245 2036.

Best of luck... we're thinking of you and wish for the very best.

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 2nd at 10:00 am to 11:30 am in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

Hello Darrell,

Many changes in Enron kept me busy during  the last few days.

Rabi and Tanya are working on a new version of the documentation
and we hope to send it to you in a few days.

I agree with you that the document we sent you was rather cryptic
and apologize for not screening it more effectively.
I agree with you regarding point # 2 and so does Tanya. I think
she did not explain precisely what she meant by her comment.

I hope to talk to you soon.

Vince


P.S. We still owe you money for work done over the last 18 months.

Subject:	Re: The first document for audit

Vince:

I read the relibaility-based VAR method document with interest.

Here are some comments:

1. The document falls short of describing how
to use the method in practice, but rather
gives some general motivation. I am confident
that I myself could not develop an algorithm
based on this document, unless all of the
derivative valuation functions are explicit
(and rather nice) functions
with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case
the VAR problem is not so hard in any case,
as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case.
(My comment here is critical of exposition.
I do not suggest that the proposed method
is weak!)

2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan
addresses only normal returns is not
correct. The main point of our paper was to allow
for jumps, including fat tails and skewness.
The comment that we rely on delta-gamma
is a good criticism,and the main potential
advantage of the reliability approach,
if it works in practical cases.

3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from
the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))

4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 lines
from the bottom.

5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does
not mention what machine was used.

6. The example (page 8) does
not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0,
and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?)
are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis
is an extra order of magnitude, with lots
of skewness.


Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot,
and left me wanting more clarity,
and a cookbook.


I hope `events' at Enron have not made things
difficult for you.

I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.


Warmest personal regards, Darrell

Mike,

Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit. I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed.
Makes no sense to sound too apologetic.

Another observation. I have just talked to Christian and suggested a conference call
Monday evening our time with Paul. You can mention this conference call  request to Paul.
The oservation: Christian may be smart
but he will one hell of a person to manage given his personality.

Vince, 

How about this to keep the peace?....

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Paul,

Vince and I were just closing the loop on the recent misunderstanding regarding a potential rotation of Christian Werner into the Research Group in Houston, and I wanted to drop you a brief note to assure you that although it is very common up here for intra-group transfers to occur, it is never done without the input, advice and consent from the current supervisor at the very inception.

The first response I had when Christian proposed the arrangement was (and I quote myself) "What does Paul think of the idea?"  Christian properly responded that the whole idea would be contingent on finding and training a replacement meteorologist for the Sydney office and getting your buy-in that the move would be good for Mother Enron in totality.

It was only with that understanding that any conversations along those lines proceeded.  Christian showed me the modelling progress he had made (Vince was out of town for this and thus unaware of it), but, quite frankly, I was very impressed with his achievements. I can see how he has become a valuable asset to your efforts.

The way we left the matter when Christian returned to Australia was that he would propose the subject to you for any further action.

Then, before I even had an opportunity to update Vince upon his return on my discussions with Christian, Christian called Vince to get his ideas on the subject (My hours aren't as conducive to Houston-Sydney phone link-ups, but Vince is here late into the night).   Vince's first and immediate reaction to the idea was to set up a telephone conference with you before even proceeding with the concept.

That is what somehow triggered the misunderstanding, but while at the same time, clarified what was happening and alerted you to the situation.  

You have a great asset there in Christian, but be assured we're not poachers!

Hope this is the last beating the dead horse needs.

- Mike

My budget does not anticipate currently any expansion.

Vince,

Steve Leppard suggested that I contact you about the possibility of a position in Houston. I worked as an analyst under Steve in London's Metal Analytics group. I was planning on returning to the States before they announced the redundancies in Europe, and the redundancy program made a move back to Houston all the more appealing. I am a first-year analyst with a statistics background, and I would be very interested in working for Enron in Houston. 

Steve has told me that he would be happy to give me a recommendation. If you know of a position which might be suitable, I would be very happy to speak to you at your convenience.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Subject:	Patent attorney

Vince: 
I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
position by filing my own "provisional patent application."  This establishes  
the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
282-1856. 
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:   
pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) 
yet2come.com 
Hope this is helpful. 
Regards, 
Larry Thorne

Frank,

I looked at your resume. There is no good fit with my group.
I have forwarded your resume to 2 different units of Enron
(Enron Industrial Markets) and Enron Networks. They may be interested in your skills.

I have not heard from you for a few days and was  wondering what is happening. The last time I spoke to Shelley, everything was  fine and that you were still going ahead with your presentation and  co-presenting the workshop on energy risk.
 
Please do reply to put my mind at  rest!

Subject:=09Argentina FX and CPI curves, dated 6/20/01

Cindy,

Please find attached the Argentine peso and CPI forecast.

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had be=
en expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a=
 basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached =
for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dol=
lar currency board.  The economy ministry took a first step toward this new=
 basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the=
 traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker e=
uro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros a=
nd 50% US dollars.  At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation =
of the peso vis-a-vis the basket.  An 8% devaluation at this juncture does =
not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help =
boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis=
-a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year.  Initial reports indicate =
that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt servic=
e at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one). =20

With such a change in currency regime as being contemplated in the Argentin=
e Congress, investor confidence could wane if the plan is approved and as t=
he implications of the new plan are interpreted by the market and as the su=
stainability of the existing currency board arrangement outside the export =
sector is analyzed.  A loss of investor confidence will put additional pres=
sure on the peso, pressure which has not existed previous to this new annou=
ncement by economy chief Cavallo, especially now that the government's debt=
 swap (exchanging short-term goverment paper for longer-term bonds) has bee=
n successfully executed.  As a consequence, although our forecast attached =
below assumes a one-for-one peso peg to the US dollar at this point to allo=
w the quarterly revaluations to be completed in a timely fashion, this curv=
e is subject to change upon knowledge of the Congressional vote and an anal=
ysis of the details announced with the vote as to the mechanics of this new=
 basket regime for exporters and for the economy as a whole.

Dear Vince,

I am curious whether you are familiar with the attached Darden school case
on Enron... FYI.

John Martin and I would really like to try to interest you in coming to
campus sometime this fall to present a faculty seminar.  Selfishly, I would
also like to try arrange such a visit so that I can have you present to my
risk management class.  I called Shirley Crenshaw today, and she mentioned
that you were on your way back from Poland, so I hope we'll be able to talk
soon about the possibility of a visit this fall.  The best number for
reaching me is 512-751-3709.

Thanks,

Jim Garven

Good to hear you are enjoying a little slower summer schedule. Never hurts to
have a change of pace.

Wish I could say so, but no I have not heard a word from anyone over in HR.

And speaking of Enron, ironically I finally met Beth Perlman (and her Mom) at
a party Dawn and I attended while we where in NY.

Steve,

Two things. 

1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but
want to make sure I did not miss any important point.

2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship,
how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly,
Houston? Please, let me know.

Please keep me in the loop regarding who you decide to send (just in case she calls me back).  I ask that the person you pick, call Amy directly and coordinate with her.

Dear Ms. McVicker,

Thank you for your help in arranging a speaker from your group to come to Wharton. There is a lot of excitement here currently about the energy industry, and we have a very active Energy group that arranges engagements and discussions. 

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry, though we are open to any suggestions of the speaker. Questions include:
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday at
4:30 PM. Dates open are September 24, Oct 1, Nov 5, Nov 12. A presentation is followed by Q&A and then a suggested dinner and cocktails with Prof. Paul Kleindorfer and a few students.

Thank you again for your help. I look forward to hearing back from you or someone in your group.

Sincerely, 

Amy Richard

MBA Candidate and Research Assistant (working with Paul Kleindorfer on the Wharton/Enron Risk Management project via Vince Kiminski)

Vince: 
I too enjoyed meeting you, and I wish you all the best in the SEC testimony and otherwise.  Should you at any time conclude that counsel would be helpful (even if only marginally) or if you simply want to confer in connection with the SEC or any other governmental investigation, please feel free to give me a call.  I'd be happy to help.

Michael, 
To follow up on my first message, I want to inform you that I decided 
to appear before the SEC investigators without a legal counsel. I simply 
feel 
that your highly competent help is not required in my case. 
I want to thank you for the time you spent with me on Wednesday. 
My only regret is that I shall have no opportunity to spend more time 
with you and learn from your experience.

position is of interest to you, I welcome a call or email from you.

Subject:	RE: Resume

Vince,

	he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background (and then some credit exposure calculation) with not much credit data analysis experience.  I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway.
	If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Generators/Power Marketers December 19  FERC Post-Meeting Memo
=20
Introduction =20
At the last Commission meeting of the year, FERC approved  the first RTO in=
 the Midwest and issued some critical orders on RTO development,  announced=
 plans to defer action and the effects of its November market power  orders=
, modified mitigation measures for the Western Systems Coordinating  Counci=
l, reaffirmed price mitigation measures for the California ISO markets,  an=
d challenged industry to develop a "single" industry consensus organization=
 by  March 15, 2002 to be the standards-setting body for commercial busines=
s and  communications protocol standards.=20
To that end , the Alliance of  Energy Suppliers and EEI encourages industry=
 to actively participate in its  national meetings being held in four regio=
ns of the country to advance the  development of principles for which to fo=
rm this organization. The  first of the four regional meetings will be held=
 on January 15, 2002 in  Phoenix, AZ with the remaining meeting in Cincinna=
ti, OH, New  York City, and Atlanta, GA .  An e-mail with all of the necess=
ary  logistical information has been circulated.  If you are interested in =
 attending or sending a company representative and did not receive the earl=
ier  e-mail, please let us know.=20
In addition, FERC announced  a series of technical conferences on standard =
market design and structure,  market based rate /market power, and energy i=
nfrastructure.=20
=20
If you would like copies of any orders, please do not hesitate to  contact =
us.
Midwest ISO Receives FERC's  Approval as an RTO=20
In a series of inter-related RTO  decisions, FERC approved the nations firs=
t RTO, granting the Midwest ISOs  proposal to become an RTO, while rejectin=
g a similar plan from the Alliance  Companies to form the Alliance RTO. In =
reversing prior policy, FERC concluded  that the ARTO proposal lacked suffi=
cient scope and size to exist as a  stand-alone RTO and told the Alliance C=
ompanies to explore how their business  plan can be accommodated within the=
 [MISO] structure. Allowing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best=
 solution that would compromise customers'  interests, FERC stated.=20
In related developments, FERC also approved  International Transmission Com=
pany's request to transfer operational control of  its transmission facilit=
ies to MISO and accepted an agreement between MISO and  International Trans=
mission that would allow the company to be an independent  transmission com=
pany that would share certain RTO functions with MISO. Finally,  in a relat=
ed docket FERC granted in part National Grids request for a  declaratory or=
der that it is not a market participant, but dismissed the  Alliance Compan=
ies business plan without prejudice as unneeded given the other  Alliance o=
rder, thus nullifying Grids proposal to manage ARTO. (More  detailed RTO su=
mmary provided below)=20
FERC Delays Implementation of New Market Power Rules =20
FERC announced that it would delay the effects of its November 20 market  p=
ower orders. In FERC's December 19 order, it recognized the Alliance of  En=
ergy Suppliers' filing requesting FERC to vacate or stay the effects  of it=
s market power orders and initiate a rulemaking proceeding to allow for  co=
mments by affected industry participants, as basis for its change in policy=
  action. We should claim this as a victory--for FERC has announced an upco=
ming  technical conference to discuss said orders and allow industry to voi=
ce its  concerns over the implications of such measures on the competitive =
wholesale  markets. Although a date for this technical conference has not b=
een announced,  Chairman Wood said that details of the conference will be r=
eleased in a  notational order. FERC has also delayed implementation of cer=
tain aspects of the  new Supply Margin Assessment (SMA) market power screen=
 test. =20
FERC Sets Schedule for Electric Market Design;  Industry Told to Select Who=
lesale Market Standards Body or FERC Will Do  So.=20
FERC outlined a schedule for a rulemaking in the  Electric Market Design do=
cket and announced the release of a staff white paper  to serve as a strawm=
an piece for continued collaboration with interested parties  on standardiz=
ed electric market design. FERC stated it expected to host industry  worksh=
ops in early 2002, tentatively set for January 22 -25 and February 4- 8,  t=
o further develop ideas on market standardization and issue a NOPR in March=
  2002. The NOPR would be followed by additional workshops in April and May=
 to  discuss NOPR inclusions and workshop developments. Written comments on=
 the NOPR  and workshop progress will also be due in May. A final rule is e=
xpected to be  issued in July 2002. Although FERC staff recognized that thi=
s was a very  ambitious schedule, the FERC presenter said they wanted to "g=
et done before  summer break" (2002).=20
Meanwhile, FERC said, interested parties should  evaluate NAESB, NERC and a=
lternative proposals for an organization to develop  wholesale electric ind=
ustry business practice and communication standards, and  agree on a single=
 consensus, industry-wide organization to develop these  standards by March=
 15, 2002. The Order indicated that should industry not agree  on a single =
organization by that date, FERC would either choose an organization  or ins=
titute a proceeding to develop the necessary standards. =20
Commissioner Brownell reiterated her dismay and disbelief with  industry's =
lag in progress: "[l]et's get this done.".. " I can't believe we're  still =
debating the "who". The other three Commissioners indicated their general  =
support for the Order. Commissioner Breathitt believes that this ANOPR proc=
ess  is working well because it "gives industry something to coalesce aroun=
d."  Breathitt was also in favor of industry answering the question of how =
much  standardization do we need and how much do we need to leave to creati=
vity and  innovation?  Chairman Wood concluded his remarks, saying, "[t]he =
GIGA-NOPR  is on its way."=20
The staff white paper covering these issues is available  from the FERC web=
site at: http://www.ferc.gov/electric/rto/mrkt-strct-comments/mrkt-strct-co=
ncept.PDF   .=20
FERC Largely Reaffirms Prior Western  Market Price Mitigation Orders, Modif=
ies Price Cap to Account for NW Winter  Peaking Concerns=20
In a broad rehearing order that addresses a  wide range of issues related t=
o California and the western energy markets, FERC  generally denied reheari=
ng requests and reaffirmed earlier decisions on pricing  and price mitigati=
on measures. The order addresses rehearing and clarification  requests for =
the Commission's August 23, November 1, December 8 and December 15,  2000 o=
rders along with its March 9, June 19, and July 25, 2001 refund and price  =
mitigation orders. Among adjustments made to previous orders, FERC modified=
 the  scope of price mitigation and must-offer requirements, especially as =
applied to  governmental sellers and cooperatives, eliminated the undersche=
duling penalty  established in the December 15 Order, and provided an oppor=
tunity for certain  entities to submit evidence that the refund methodology=
 results in a revenue  shortfall. FERC also modified and provided clarifica=
tions on setting of the  mitigated market-clearing price.=20
In particular, FERC clarified that: =20
government sellers and cooperatives are excluded from price mitigation as  =
its applies to bilateral transactions outside the ISO spot market and also =
 with the must-run requirement outside of California;=20
units operating outside of California may set the mitigated  market-clearin=
g price;=20
the mitigated market-clearing price is to be set by the proxy price of the =
 last unit dispatched, rather than the lower of the proxy price or the actu=
al  bid of the marginal unit;=20
and generators subject to the must-offer requirement should be able to  rec=
over their costs for complying with the ISO's instructions to keep their  u=
nits at minimum load status, and that the ISO must pay these costs,  regard=
less of whether the ISO buys the power.=20

Modification to Western-Wide Price Mitigation  Measures=20
In a separate order, FERC responded to industry  recommendation from its Oc=
tober 29 technical conference and modified the price  mitigation methodolog=
y for spot market transactions for the west-wide market for  the winter sea=
son. FERC stated that changes would support continued price  stability and =
balance in the western markets. The changes were called for in  part, FERC =
said, since the area the California ISO serves is a summer peaking  system =
and a large portion of the 11-state Western Systems Coordinating Council,  =
consists of winter peaking systems. The changes extend from the date of the=
  order through April 30, 2002, at which time the summer mitigation measure=
s will  be reinstated. Most notably, the new cap levels take into account f=
luctuation in  natural gas prices.=20
Modifications to previous mitigation measures  are;
raises cap level from $98 to $108
continues to apply 10 percent credit worthiness adder
sets February 2002 as date that final outstanding payments be made to  West=
ern sellers of power

FERC's objective through these order was to allow  FERC and affected partie=
s in the West to move forward on calculating  any refunds owed and to provi=
de greater rate certainty and stability to the  market, according to the co=
mmissioners.=20
More information on the  California and western market changes is available=
 in FERC's press release:  http://www.ferc.gov/news/pressreleases/calif1-de=
c192001.PDF   and the full order: http://www.ferc.gov/electric/bulkpower/el=
00-95-001-12-19-01.PDF   , both available in "pdf" format from FERC's websi=
te. =20
RTO Developments =20
MISO Approved As Nations First RTO =20
In approving MISOs RTO application as the nations first RTO, FERC  said tha=
t it complies with the vision and requirements of Order No. 2000, in  parti=
cular the requirement that an RTO be of sufficient scope. FERC cited  favor=
ably MISOs announced merger with the Southwest Power Pool and said that it =
 was particularly encouraged by MISO's planned accommodation of flexible bu=
siness  plans and innovation as well as its considerable geographic span.=
=20
For the most part, FERC found that MISO satisfied the four characteristics =
 for an RTO independence, scope and configuration, operational authority, a=
nd  short-term reliability, as well as key functions. FERC did, however, di=
rect MISO  to submit a number of revisions. FERC found MISO's independence =
satisfactory in  most respects, but said that transmission owners cannot be=
 permitted to have  veto privileges on filings that affect pricing. FERC co=
nditioned MISO's RTO  status on modification of the MISO Agreement to give =
it the authority to propose  rates, terms and conditions of transmission se=
rvice under the MISO tariff. On  the scope and regional configuration chara=
cteristic, FERC told MISO to present  recommendations within 60 days addres=
sing the question of its eastern seam prior  to the integration of the Alli=
ance Companies into MISO. FERC also indicated that  MISO should participate=
 in its recently announced rulemaking proceeding to  standardize market des=
ign rules. However, FERC said, MISO should also address  certain congestion=
 management issues prior to implementation of standardized  market rules. F=
ERC also directed additional changes to ensure the independence  of the mar=
ket monitor and required modification of the planning framework to  reflect=
 that it will consider all market perspectives and to accommodate  third-pa=
rty investment, construction and ownership of transmission  facilities.
=20
Alliance Companies Told to Work Under MISO; FERC Finds  IRCA Efforts Insuff=
icient=20
Citing in part strong support from a majority of the Midwest state  regulat=
ors for a single Midwest RTO and Alliance RTO (ARTO)s failure to achieve  t=
he necessary close coordination with MISO, FERC concluded that the ARTO lac=
ked  sufficient scope to exist as a stand-alone RTO. FERC expressed confide=
nce,  however, that the Alliance Companies' desire to be a viable, for-prof=
it  transmission business can be accommodated under the MISO Appendix I str=
ucture.  FERC emphasized the importance of fostering RTO development design=
ed to provide  a seamless and robust market for millions of customers. Allo=
wing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best solution that would co=
mpromise customers'  interests, concluded FERC. The Commission ordered the =
Alliance Companies to file  a status report on their efforts to join MISO w=
ithin 60 days. In the Order, FERC  acknowledged the significant time and ex=
pense incurred by the Alliance Companies  to date, adding that it would con=
sider proposals for recovery of all prudently  incurred costs.=20
=20
International Transmission Approved As ITC Under  MISO
In a related order, FERC said that International Transmission Company  (Int=
ernational Transmission), a subsidiary of DTE Energy, could join the new RT=
O  as an independent transmission company that will be able to pursue innov=
ative  business strategies. International Transmission proposes to maintain=
 and develop  transmission while turning over to the RTO such functions as =
congestion  management and curtailments, tariff administration, and securit=
y coordination.  DTE Energy has indicated its intention to sell Internation=
al Transmission to a  third party. FERC gave preliminarily approval for the=
 divestiture of the  transmission facilities. FERC, however, deferred rulin=
g on several contested  RTO/transco function issues until International Tra=
nsmission becomes truly  independent.
=20
National Grid Meets Independence Criterion, as FERC  Dismisses Alliance Com=
panies ARTO Business Plan
FERC granted in part and deferred in part a National Grid proposal to  mana=
ge the RTO transmission system. FERC found that National Grid is not a  mar=
ket participant by virtue of its retail obligations in New York and New  En=
gland. FERC directed the Alliance Companies to explore how their business  =
plan, including National Grid's proposal, could be accommodated within the =
MISO  RTO. FERC expressed its intent to provide more guidance on this matte=
r in future  proceedings.
=20
General Discussion
Signaling a deference to Midwestern state commissions, Chairman Wood said, =
 "[w]e have brought order out of an array of various and sundry efforts in =
the  middle of the country. . . . Its a good Christmas gift to the nation. =
Wood  cautioned that the orders findings are based on what best serves the =
public  interest in the Midwest, and that FERCs actions should not be const=
rued to  prejudge other types of RTOs in other parts of the country, includ=
ing a  structure in which a for-profit transmission company could be an umb=
rella RTO.  For her part, Commissioner Breathitt dissented on the Alliance =
Order, stating  that after the Alliance Companies have already spent over $=
75 million in  start-up costs and its plans were given tentative approval b=
y FERC over the past  two and a half years, she saw no reason to abruptly c=
hange direction and deny  Alliance Companies an opportunity to implement th=
eir business model. The  Commission has not done all it could or should do =
to allow Alliance to develop,  Breathitt said.  Addressing the near-unanimo=
us support among Midwest  regulators for a single Midwest RTO, Commissioner=
 Massey stated, we are heeding  that advice and moving forward accordingly.=
 For his part, the Alliance Order did  not represent a change of position, =
he said, noting that he has long favored  forcing a consolidation of the tw=
o RTO proposals. Additional details on these  orders can be found in the FE=
RC press release which is available from FERCs  website at: http://www.ferc=
.gov/news/pressreleases/mwestxpressrel.PDF   .=20
=20
PJM - PJM West Denied on a Procedural  Basis=20
Chairman Wood, in meeting discussion stated that the  rejection was on a pr=
ocedural issue only, with a delay required only because of  provisions pend=
ing in other dockets. In a two-page letter order, FERC rejected  the reques=
t of PJM and PJM West to integrate, but Chairman Wood assured the  parties =
that FERC remained committed to the expansion effort and wants to see it  m=
ove forward very quickly. All indications are that once the other provision=
s  have been addressed, FERC would be ready to move forward on the PJM West=
 effort. =20
FERC Directs PJM To amend Tariffs to Include New  Oversight Measures=20
FERC terminated its investigation into allegations that PECO Energy Company=
  had operated its transmission system in a manner that illegally advantage=
d a  corporate affiliate. FERC staff indicated that the record in the proce=
eding did  not establish a violation of the Federal Power Act or FERC's Sta=
ndards of  Conduct sufficient to warrant further enforcement proceedings an=
d that further  investigations into the matter were not warranted or necess=
ary. Simultaneously,  FERC accepted a report from PJM outlining a series of=
 improvements to its  current procedures for reporting of transmission outa=
ges and the rating of  transmission facilities. FERC directed PJM to file a=
mendments to its tariffs to  reflect the new procedures. Commenting on the =
swift resolution of the matter,  Chairman Wood noted the importance of lift=
ing the cloud of an investigation  promptly when the evidence warrants it.=
=20
Staff  Reports High Cost of Congestion; Need RTO Congestion Management, Mor=
e  Investment=20
A presentation of a FERC staff report on electric  transmission constraints=
 detailed the high costs of congestion and suggested  that building more tr=
ansmission would likely lower overall consumer costs. The  report, which FE=
RC staff acknowledged suffered from certain data limitations,  found that b=
ottlenecks in the transmission system cost consumers more than $1  billion =
over the past two summers. The report also demonstrates the need for  stron=
g congestion management systems at RTOs, FERC staff said. FERC  commissione=
rs commended staff on the presentation and seemed supportive of the  conclu=
sion that building additional infrastructure would bring benefits to  energ=
y consumers. FERC staff also noted that a parallel DOE National Grid Study =
 should be completed and released before the end of the year.=20
The staff  presentation is available in MS PowerPoint on the FERC "Discussi=
on Papers" page  at: http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/Discus=
sion_papers.htm   .=20
Additional Commission  Action=20
FERC Issues Accounting NOPR  with Question to Industry=20
FERC issued an accounting NOPR  (Docket No. RM02-3) seeking comment on whet=
her to require unregulated energy  marketers and traders to disclose holdin=
gs in derivative financial contracts  used to limit risks of volatile price=
 swings in energy purchases and sales.  Chairman Wood said he looks to indu=
stry to answer the question and tell FERC  that the current exemption and b=
lanket waivers and authorizations should remain  or not. Commissioner Breat=
hitt pointed out that the current entities that must  comply with reporting=
 requirements of derivative activity are not major players  in the derivati=
ve markets, but the open-ended question, if answered in the  affirmative, w=
ould place burdensome requirements on a sector of the market, i.e  power ma=
rketers, that most delve in that arena. Chairman Wood said that he might  b=
e in agreement with possible responses from industry that say that "maybe t=
hese  processes are for another agency to do, e.g. SEC, CFTC, etc. ."=20
Separately, the NOPR proposes changes to the Uniform System of Accounts  (U=
SA) to record transactions required under Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard  (FASB) Statement 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and E=
quity  Securities, FASB Statement 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, and =
Statement  133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitie=
s. The NOPR also  proposes changes in the annual reports to the Commission,=
 including the Form 1,  to conform to recent actions by FASB to tighten dis=
closure rules. The proposal  follows up Commission guidance issued in Augus=
t 2001 for using the existing USA  for recording transactions covered by th=
ese FASB Statements.=20
All four  commissioners endorsed the NOPR. Chairman Wood said the new rules=
 would focus  more on providing transparency to investors than broadening F=
ERC's regulatory  authority. Commissioner Breathitt commented that the new =
rule would seek to  collect annual data, not give FERC the ability to "acti=
vely monitor" the  complicated transactions. "We would be obtaining a yearl=
y snapshot of derivative  positions," Breathitt said. "I think this is a go=
od step." =20
FERC Staff Provides Update on Development  of Standardized Interconnection =
Policy=20
FERC staff reviewed  the process and progress of the collaborative efforts =
to develop a standardized  generation interconnection policy. While interco=
nnection documents were filed on  December 14th as required by the ANOPR, p=
articipants noted that the documents  remain a work in progress. Participan=
ts had requested, and FERC granted on  December 14, an extension of time to=
 file the consensus documents to January 11  and to January 25 to file fina=
l comments in the docket. The collaborative  process remains on schedule to=
 take up the "money side" of the issue in April  2002.=20
Technical Conference On Energy  Infrastructure in the Northeast=20

Mike,

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

Vince,

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him with no trouble at all.

Thanks,
Anne

Subject:	2002 Plan Variance from 2001 Forecast
Importance:	High

Vince,

As part of the plan process, I have to prepare a variance analysis between the 2001 forecast and the 2002 plan.  I have attached a summary for your review and I need your help explaining some of the variances.  The 2001 forecast is based mostly on plan, but I did use an annualized amount for some expenses for which the actuals were considerably above or below plan.  Please let me know if you think I need to adjust the forecast because this will, in turn, affect the variances.

The main items I need are as follows:

1) An explanation of the increase in headcount (14 people (26%) over the average of 53 I have forecasted).

2) The Recruiting and Relocations account is new for 2002 - these costs were previously included in Travel.  Therefore, I would expect that the sum of Recruiting and Relocations and Travel for 2002 would be comparable to the 2001 Forecast for Travel alone, but there is a variance of about $140,000 (38%).  I expect that much of this is due to the increase in headcount, but that is not enough to fully justify the increase.  Are you expecting a higher level of travel in 2002?

3) Same as above for Conferences and Training.  This is a new account and these costs used to be in Tuition Reimbursement (this account included all training).  The increase in Tuition Reimbursement alone is really more than I can explain as due to the increase in headcount.  Are there specific conferences planned for 2002 that were not attended in 2001?

4) Can you give me a breakdown of what is included in the amount for Outside Services?

5) If I understand your allocation percentages, you will allocate 100% to other business units, compared to the approximately 73% that is forecast.  Is this correct?

Thanks for your help,
Diane

ABSTRACT:
 Event risk is the risk that a portfolio's value can be affected
 by large jumps in market prices. Event risk is synonymous with
 "fat tails" or "jump risk". Event risk is one component of
 "specific risk", defined by bank supervisors as the component of
 market risk not driven by market-wide shocks. Standard
 Value-at-Risk (VaR) models used by banks to measure market risk
 do not do a good job of capturing event risk. In this paper, I
 discuss the issues involved in incorporating event risk into
 VaR. To illustrate these issues, I develop a VaR model that
 incorporates event risk, which I call the Jump-VaR model. The
 Jump-VaR model uses any standard VaR model to handle "ordinary"
 price fluctuations and grafts on a simple model of price jumps.
 The effect is to "fatten" the tails of the distribution of
 portfolio returns that is used to estimate VaR, thus increasing
 VaR. I note that regulatory capital could rise or fall when
 jumps are added, since the increase in VaR would be offset by a
 decline in the regulatory capital multiplier on specific risk
 from 4 to 3. In an empirical application, I use the Jump-VaR
 model to compute VaR for two equity portfolios. I note that, in
 practice, special attention must be paid to the issues of
 correlated jumps and double-counting of jumps. As expected, the
 estimates of VaR increase when jumps are added. In some cases,
 the increases are substantial. As expected, VaR increases by
 more for the portfolio with more specific risk.

 Keywords: Specific risk, market risk, jump risk, jump
 diffusion, default risk

Vince,
I enjoyed your presentation at the SIAM workshop last Friday. I have
a much greater appreciation for the difficult problems you all solve.
If at all possible, I would like to get a copy of your talk and
any references to review papers in the general area of market modeling
and potentially control. Have a great weekend.

Best Regards,

Dean Kassmann

Jay,

I have to add another item to a long list of your headaches.

Greg Whalley gave us marching orders to treat the development of quantitative
models for data mining of EOL trade records as the top priority.
I shall be providing Greg bi-weekly updates on the project. 

FYI only. I am flying with Greg next week to a meeting with a third party
that may be involved in some aspects of this project. I shall tell you more when
we meet.

I know that we, as well as Greg, can count on full support and cooperation from you.

I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, to set up a meeting with you next week after I come back from
the trip.

Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

Subject:	joke unfinished

Hi folks,

Here is the original version of the joke I tried to make at yesterday meeting.

I've never been much of a Handy Man. I decided to order the new Time
Life series of Do-It-Yourself books. The first book was titled, "How to Fix
the Garbage Disposal." Though I followed all the instructions to the best of
my ability, and spent many long hours, I never did get the darn thing
repaired. Fortunately, the next book in the series was titled, "How to eat
with a HOOK!!!!"

Let's have a good day!

Jaesoo

Gwyn,

It's very thoughtful of you but you should go ahead
and continue the lessons.

Hi Vince,

Given the recent developments in Enron's financial outlook and likely need for expense control, I wanted to ask you if Enron would still agree to pay for my French lessons going forward.  My french tutor is possibly going to return to France to retire in the coming months, but I think I will probably continue with my lessons until the end of this year.  I have been thankful that Enron has financed these expenses in the past, but understand in tough times we all need to make sacrifices.

Thank you.

Gwyn

Subject:	Neptune

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Vince,

   Thank you very much for your effort to set up this conference.

   Since Zhiyong just had an accident yesterday, I am afraid it might not be a good time to talk to him at this moment
   about my transition ( I have not talked to Zhiyong yet, yesterday Zimin told me to go ahead and Zhiyong had the accident).
    Could we wait till he feels better ? 
   What do you think about ? Maybe I worry too much.

Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

Something to brighten your day - these are great!

************************************************************************

The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an
urgent problem with one of the main computers.  He dialed the employee's
home phone number and was greeted with a child's whispering, "Hello?"

Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster the
boss asked, "Is your daddy home?"

"Yes," whispered the small voice.

"May I talk with him?" the man asked.

To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, "No."

Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "Is your mommy there?"

"Yes", came the answer.

"May I talk with her?"

Again the small voice whispered, "No."

Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left at home
alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who
should be there watching over the child.  "Is there any one there besides
you?" the boss asked the child.

"Yes," whispered the child, "a policeman."

Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked
"May I speak with the policeman"?

"No, he's busy," whispered the child.

"Busy doing what?" asked the boss.

"Talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman." came the whispered answer.

Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a
helicopter through the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, "What is that
noise?"

"A hello-copper," answered the whispering voice.

"What is going on there?" asked the boss, now alarmed.

In an awed whispering voice, the child answered, "The search team just
landed the hello-copper."

Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the boss asked,

"What are they searching for?"

Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle:
"Me."

********************************************************************************

Never Ask Your Child a Question Too Many Times

Have you ever asked your child a question too many times?  Here is an
account from one woman:

My three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training; and I was
on him constantly. One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in
between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room.

While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked
my seven-month-old daughter, who was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not
asked to go potty in a while, so I asked and he said "No".

I kept thinking, "Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have
any clothes with me.  Then I said, "Matt, are you sure you did not have an
accident?"

"No," he replied.

I just knew that he must have had, because the smell was getting worse.  So
I asked one more time, "Matt, did you have an accident?"

This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his
cheeks and yelled: "See, Mom, IT'S JUST BOTTOM BURPS!!'  While 100 people
nearly choked to death on their tacos, he calmly pulled up his pants and
sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened.  I, of course, was mortified

Some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better, when they came over and
thanked me for the best laugh they'd ever had.

******************************************************************************

And one particular four-year old prayed, "And forgive us our trash baskets
as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets."

******************************************************************************

A little boy was overheard praying:  "Lord, if you can't make me a better
boy, don't worry about it.  I'm having a real good time like I am."

******************************************************************************

Fun in Church

[From James Dobson]  One Sunday, a young boy was acting up during the
morning worship hour.  The parents did their best to maintain some sense of
order in the pew but were losing the battle.  Finally, the father swung the

little fellow up on his shoulder and walked sternly up the aisle
on his way out to deliver some thoroughly deserved discipline.  As they
exited the church auditorium, the little one lifted his head and called to
the congregation, "Y'all pray for me!"

*****************************************************************************

A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the way
to church service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"

One bright little girl replied, "Because people are sleeping."

*****************************************************************************

The preacher moved briskly about the platform as he preached emphatically.

Because he was wired for sound with a lapel microphone, he jerked the mike
cord as he went.  When he moved to one side, he got wound up in the cord
and nearly tripped before jerking free.  After several circles and jerks, a
little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother and whispered, "If he
gets loose, will he hurt us?"

*****************************************************************************

Six-year old Angie and her four-year old brother Joel were sitting together
in church.  Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud.  Finally, his big
sister had had enough. "You're not supposed to talk out loud in church."

"Why?  Who's going to stop me?" Joel asked.

Angie pointed to the back of the church and said, "See those two men
standing by the door?  They're hushers."

******************************************************************************

After the church service a little boy told the pastor, "When I grow up, I'm
going to give you some money."

"Well, thank you," the pastor replied.  "But why?"

"Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever had."

********************************************************************************

A father was at the beach with his children when the four-year-old son ran
up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay
dead in the sand.  "Daddy, what happened to him?" the son asked.

"He died and went to Heaven," the dad replied.

The boy thought a moment and then said, "Did God throw him back down?"

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

I've been meaing to ask you about the paper I sent to Sam on calculating implied pdf's for futures prices. Sam told me that you didn't want to include it in RI because it and the EOL article gave too much away.  I've talked with several folks about the approach outlined in the paper.  I've reworked the paper to try and better tailor it to traders, and I'd be interested in your feedback.

Brian,

Another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place.

As you know, Brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage. About
95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of
water in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge
exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.

Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil 
are asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting
technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These
objections may not apply to Brazil.

Can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from
Sao Paulo to discuss the problem? He will be  back in his office on Tuesday .

I shall call you tomorrow about it. What is your phone number?

Vince

Subject:	Neptune

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

   into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in his
   ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who know
   how
   to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system designers
   at
   IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro
   hard
   drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to
   him.

   Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

      Hi Vince -
      I wanted to check on a couple of items following our discussions
   earlier
      this year: 1) has your son decided where he will work? and 2) will
   you
      be in

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Donald,

Thanks for your interest in Enron. I shall be glad to talk to you
about the energy industry needs for quants and what you can
do to prepare yourself for the job search.
Please, call me at 713 853 3848 to set up a meeting
or call my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, at 713 853 5290.

The prospects for employment with Enron, in your field, are rather uncertain
at this point. I do not anticipate any hiring over the next 12 months.

This would provide me with an opportunity to see if the activities within your group fit with my expectations.  Additionally, I could expound on my interest and work concerning numerical methods for pricing and hedging derivative securities.  A formal interview could be established at a later date.  For your reference, I've attached a copy of my resume.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

==================================================================
RiskNews Update - week ending 27/4/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is ?151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

Vince, 

Thanks for the email.  This new message from Britt Davis is in response to a recently-received subpoena, and is just a precaution until we can discuss what is required with Wilmer Cutler.  Even though emails would have been deleted from your system we have retained the backup tapes so we have a complete record.  Please let me know if there are some that you wish to retrieve.

Thanks and have a happy New Year.

	Britt,

	It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
	30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
	of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
	who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
	complained to me about the same problem.

	I hope you can look into.

Thought this might be a better form of communication since it has been so
difficult for us to communicate via telephone.

As I had mentioned this morning, Joao Neves is quite interested in joining
your team and I would like to ask you, if you feel it appropriate at this
time, for Joao to re-visit you and your team to discuss, possibly more in
depth issues.

Please advise.

Subject:	A friend of mine

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

If you have completed these reviews, please send them to me as soon as possible.  However, if you have not had a chance to sit down with these employees and discuss their performance and objectives for the next six months, please do so in the near future so that the employee will have ample opportunity to make the necessary adjustments and/ or complete their 6 month objectives.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Subject:	Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis

Hi Vince,

	Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
	The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
	The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights on the corn price protection approach.

Anne,

Shalesh told me that his visited his HR screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an Associate.
This entry was reversed later.

Any reason for that? It may be related to his transfer from EBS.
We can check with his previous business unit whether they gave /promised him a promotion.

Vince,

As per our conversation yesterday I would very much appreciate it if you could help me with this matter.  I was under the impression that I would be promoted to Associate this August, which according to my pay stub and eHRonline hasn't occurred.  According to the A/A rules, a copy of which I am attaching below, an Analyst can be promoted to Associate if he/she falls under one of the criteria among several.  The one I believe I am eligible under states:

-  completed 2 years in the Program; have a performance rating of Excellent or above; and have either (1) an appropriate graduate degree or (2)  1 year of relevant commercial work experience prior to Enron

Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to look into this issue.  Thank you very much for your time and help.

Shalesh

The proposed topics are sketched out in Amy Richard's message below (basically what the Bonn Accords mean for the future of energy, especially in the U.S.), but Steve may, after further discussions with Amy, decide that another topic is a better choice.  I am sure they are flexible.

We'll wait a day or so and give Steve a call.  I am sharing this with Amy Richard who will call Steve.  I will be in close touch with Amy on this matter and I look forward to meeting Steve.

Thanks very much in advance for giving us an introduction.

Paul,

Thanks for your message. Terry left Enron a few weeks ago after many years
with the company.
The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF
OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586
EB 4712 , steve.kean@enron.com .

I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you. Can
you indicate the subject
of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?

Vince

   We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good
   meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now
   interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

   On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would
   be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron
   (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).
   Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his
   replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in
   asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so
   that he knows we are doing some work together.

   Thanks in advance.

   Paul,

   The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested
   in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn,
   senior vice president, Environmental and International Government
   Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said
   he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though
   I could not verify that he is now.

   The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the
   near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus
   strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How
   is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse
   gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30
   to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

   I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let
   me know if there is any other information you need.

   Thank you,
   Amy

   Hi Amy,
   Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
   Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
   Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
   what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
   the March 1997 meeting as well.

   Hi Michael

   Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
   Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
   ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
   of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
   that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
   for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
   Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
   the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
   still be there but we can try.

   Thanks-
   Amy Richard

Michael,

I really appreciate it. It will be a great opportunity to give you
an update about my plans. I hope to continue working
in the energy industry and continue as a customer of CERA once
I move to a new position. My last day at Enron will be January the 31st.
My personal E-mail address in the interim period is vkaminski@aol.com.

I assume I can just show up on the first day of your conference.

5 Discussion:  *** Tropical system is very much up in the air. A trough is =
in the air for the West. Plenty of heat and humidity is in the air for the =
East.***  The tropical wave in the Caribbean near Hispaniola does not look =
as organized as it did yesterday. This will result in a delay of naming it =
a storm with the distinct possibility it never develops. Most of the models=
 do bring a system into the Southern Gulf by Thursday, but interaction with=
 Cuba tomorrow may keep it very weak. Steering currents favor this moving t=
owards Mexico by Sunday. The rest of the tropics remain eerily quiet.  Ther=
e is plenty of weather news for the continental U.S. in the short term and =
it centers around the Plains heat ridge. It is flexing NE once again with t=
he rest of this week looking quite hot from the Plains to the Ohio Valley. =
La! te in the week, the Great Lakes and NE get in on this for a day or two,=
 but there is still a weakening Canadian influence on those areas. Another =
front should drop from the Lakes towards the Mid-Atlantic Thursday and Frid=
ay. The NW flow does not look particularly impressive, so the cooling looks=
 moderate at best. We still look to be absent of widespread 100 degree heat=
 outside the Plains, but plenty of 90's and humidity will bring 100+ aftern=
oon heat indices. There is still very little of note going on in the Wester=
n U.S. The hydro situation in the NW remains, but temperatures in most of t=
he region are at or slightly below seasonal norms.   Tomorrow: Wednesday, A=

nt 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6    Day 6-10 Discussion:  All of the models point to a ve=
ry warm period for the 6-10 day outlook (and likely beyond). The early stag=
es of my predicted warmer than normal August appear to be setting up as pla=
nned. What seems to be in disagreement is where the hottest air sets up. It=
 has been the Plains primarily this summer. The most recent runs of the Eur=
opean and Navy models suggest that the hottest air especially relative to n=
ormal shifts to the Lakes and NE as a monster of a ridge forms in the area.=
 The Canadian and MRF models look more like a flat broad ridge East of the =
Rockies which keeps the heat core West of the Mississippi. If any of these =
verify close to reality, most all of the Eastern 3/4 of the country will be=
 above normal anyway, but I like the large ridge idea, the European seems o=
verdone. The pattern continues to be favorable for t! ropical activity, but=
 something out in the tropics has to get cranked up first. The last couple =
of years, most tropical activity has been recurved NE away from the U.S. du=
e to a trough in the Atlantic. It currently is no where to be found, but at=
 the moment, neither is the tropical activity.  Day 6: Sunday, August  5, 2=

Yes, They are coming.
It makes sense for Shirley to confirm it on Friday for you
(I shall be in Dallas) before you hop on  the plane.

The meeting start at 9:00 at the Greg's office.
Hope to see you on Monday.

Hi, Vince,

I hope you are doing well.
The UBS Energy business will definitely miss you and
your weather group! I have to say everyone is quite
concerned how will we be getting the weather forecast
:).

As for me, I have accepted the UBS offer and will be
back in the Gas Fundamentals group for now.

This is my personal e-mail address, I hope we can stay
in touch,

Best regards,
Biliana Pehlivanova

Vince,

I am sorry to send this late.
I had to finish a report for DealBench team yesterday,
and read papers and prepare slides for the meeting scheduled tomorrow 2PM.
Because I thought those work has to be done first,
I didn't put the priority to the summary report.

Attached is the summary report.
However, I hope I have more time to double check this.

I'll do the proofreadding, and send this again,
after the presentation tomorrow, 
together with the summary report of tomorrow's presentation.    

I am sorry for this again.

Christie,

My movie picks for the weekend:
1. Kids will love these movies:  Gods Must Be Crazy, La Chevre, Johnny Stecchino
2. More mature audience (OK for the kids): Diva, A Letter to Three Wives (classic, 1947)


Enjoy

Vince

Do we have a presentation about Enron (January 2001 or the 1st quarter summary) from

Mike,

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

Hi,

	As per your request, here is a very rough draft of the document you requested.  It is far from being complete.

	Hopefully while in London I will have time to work on it some more.

	Your comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Vince,
 
Hope you are well? Les enjoyed his visit with you  very much by the sound of things.
 
I was wondering if you could have a quick look over  the 2 pages attached. Robin is looking for something in the next day or so and  this is as far as I've got today. The article is going to be on spark spread  options. The material attached is the opening blurb - we'll add some analysis  under different models tomorrow - I just wanted to make sure you are comfortable  with the general comments we had written so far. If you want to add anything  then that would be great - pls feel free to add a few points that we can expand  on.
 
Thanks a lot. Its a shame you can't be here for the  Risk conference in a few weeks, we could have had a reunion dinner!
 
Best regards.
 
Chris.

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Diane

Ehud,

Sorry for the delay in replying to your message.
I was on the road a lot. I am in London right now and
plan to attend the conference.

I am leaving on Saturday morning for Houston.

I have asked Shirley to get tickets for one of the evening you mentioned.
I should know by Thursday if the tickets are available.

Vince:

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Anne,

Thanks for your quick action on Prasanna. He came to us looking for a transfer.
I was reluctant to do it in the first place, because we try to avoid poaching other
groups. Given that his reviews are less than enthusiastic, we shall write him off.

Dear Vince,

Thank you for meeting me the other week when I came to Houston. As
discussed, please find attached the draft agenda for EPRM 2002 USA which
will be taking place in Houston on 14 & 15 May next year. I would be pleased
to hear your opinion of the programme - in particular if you feel I have
missed anything out or confused any of the issues.

We also discussed you speaking at the event again. I do not know what your
situation is now with the events of the past couple of weeks, but I would be
delighted if you could take part in the conference - please feel free to
choose any of the talks on the programme. (No titles or bullet points are
rigid - you can alter one to suit you.)

Many thanks for all your help with this. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Victoria

Subject:	Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast and Solicitation


As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.  

You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.

The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.

Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. 

At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. 

Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st.

Subject:=09Direct Access 8/10/01

Below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding Direct Access.  We wi=
ll continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated.=20

Summary:
Direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key compon=
ent of California's 1996 deregulation law.  Under this concept, all custome=
rs could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated util=
ity.  The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attemp=
t to solve California's costly power crisis.  It will determine whether bus=
inesses, with residential customers, pay for the bulk of the state's future=
 energy purchases. It also could determine whether Southern California Edis=
on, the state's cash-strapped No. 2 utility, will avoid bankruptcy, and whe=
ther deregulation will survive in any form.

Big businesses, free-market advocates and alternative energy providers have=
 lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so-called "direct access".=
  Now, as the state prepares to sell $13.4 billion in bonds to begin paying=
 off its debt, legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big b=
usinesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct-=
access escape route.  Regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the =
system, the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long-term e=
lectricity contracts through 2021.  That would mean residential ratepayers =
would be stuck paying the bulk of the $43 billion in future power costs, a =
point that has enraged consumer groups.  Currently, only about 88,000 custo=
mers buy their energy through direct access (per CEC statistics), including=
 about 10,000 large commercial/industrial customers, and about 78,000 resid=
ences.  Alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back =
to California's primary utility suppliers (SoCal Ed., PG&E, SDG&E) earlier =
this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with uti=
lity rates capped by the Legislature. =20

California legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the late=
st Edison bailout plan, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley. =
Under the plan, the 3,600 largest businesses would agree to pay $3.1 billio=
n of Edison's debts over 15 years.  In exchange, businesses would be allowe=
d to secure their own power contracts by 2003, but not without first paying=
 an "exit fee."  The fees and which parties would be exempt remain undeterm=
ined, however, they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation =
in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases.  It =
is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding =
direct access, California's business community will have extreme difficulty=
 accepting the terms.

To ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fe=
ars of a collapsing state budget, lawmakers have gone so far as to introduc=
e two bills, (one sponsored by Sen. Bowen and defeated in July, and a secon=
d by Assemblyman Dave Kelley,) that would rescind language in previous legi=
slation that authorized the Public Utilities Commission to block direct acc=
ess.  The California PUC has thus far stayed a decision on the matter, but =
is expected to rule by August 23rd.

Complicating the issue is Wall Street.  The state's bankers, led by J.P Mor=
gan, are nervous about selling as much as $13.4 billion in planned state bo=
nds if businesses (currently the largest ratepayers in the state, after gov=
ernments) find a way out of the system.  The bonds are meant to repay the s=
tate for $8.2 billion in power-buying costs so far this year and to cover s=
ome future costs.  Business and residential electricity customers would rep=
ay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills.  If businesses wer=
e allowed to sign on with outside energy providers, that revenue stream wou=
ld be in jeopardy.

I don't know if you are already aware of this, but Maureen Raymond has been taken ill and I understand has received medical advice that she should not travel before the end of next week at the earliest.  
Tara is the appropriate HR representative in London; I will ask her to keep both you and Houston HR informed of the situation.

Many thanks,  Tani

  Thanks for showing the trading room on Friday, and updating me about your
employment situation. Arthur and I look forward to meeting you for  lunch
this week, as we discussed. Thursday appears to be a good time for us. If it
is also convenient for you, I would propose us coming there at 11:30 so
Arthur has the chance to look at one of the trading floors. We can then
proceed to lunch and talk further about your faculty appointment.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

AEP COMPLETES PURCHASE OF HOUSTON PIPE LINE COMPANY FROM ENRON
COLUMBUS, Ohio - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) announced that it has completed its purchase of the stock of Houston Pipe Line Company (HPL), an intrastate natural gas pipeline subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE).  The acquisition includes inventory and a 30-year pre-paid lease related to the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility.  The $726.6 million for the transaction will be raised by issuing a non-controlling, preferred equity interest to private investors.  

The purchase, announced Jan. 11, 2001, was completed following clearance from the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. HPL owns, or leases, and operates one of the most extensive and flexible natural gas gathering, transportation and storage operations in Texas. HPL's intrastate system includes more than 4,400 miles of pipe with capacity of approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet per day and the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility, one of the largest storage facilities in North America with a capacity of approximately 118 billion cubic feet and significant injection and withdrawal capacity.

Siebel launch is a great success
The EIM Fundamentals Siebel Team successfully launched The Force: Episode I (Siebel Express) in record time, less than 6 weeks. This was the quickest Siebel implementation thanks to teams in EIM, Networks, PWC (PriceWaterhouseCoopers) and Siebel Corp.The team took contact and account information from 100+ EIM originators and traders and compiled them into a single database for customer management. 

Training began on May 8, 2001.  In less than a month, we have populated The Force with 5,700 Accounts (Counterparties) and 10,000 Contacts for Forest Products and Steel Industries.  We have set up and trained over 150 users in 4 different domestic locations. Originators and traders now can easily log phone calls and meetings with customers as well as store deal documentation, deal pipeline and sales stage information.

Episode II will launch end of June and will include synchronization capabilities and well as other customized fields for EIM business. Siebel Sales Enterprise is a customer-focused centralized database, which enables sharing of all information learned about our customers.  Siebel is designed to help in-house and mobile sales professionals to manage accounts, contacts, activities and opportunities associated with the sales cycle.



IN THE NEWS

Enron Tops Gas Market: Higher commodity prices and greater demand have generated record earnings for many gas marketers during the past quarter, making energy one of the few sectors gaining ground in the U.S. economy. Leading the pack is Enron whose gas volumes grew 30 percent, with 27.2 billion cfd traded on average by March 31. Much of Enron's success is attributed to EnronOnline, which saw 275,000 transactions with a total value of $162 billion in various commodities in the first quarter. The second place earner, El Paso, earned half of Enron's total with only 13.8 billion traded in 2001.

Hi Vince,

I just received a call from Scot Gallagher at Arthur Anderson. They are seeking some clarifcations about how we formed the portfolios of puts and what volatility was used.  They would like to do a conference call.  Apparently, this is not a senior level issue.  Please advise if you would like to attend. Thanks.

Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago
and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to

Subject:	Update

I've talked several times with Scott Gerson of the Focus Group about the list of candidates he has presented to you.  He says that Sriram is "ready to go", but that the other NY guys are "kinda iffy".  He did say that they may become more interested in Houston if they don't receive NY job offers within the next week or so. We have scheduled Sriram to come in to interview with the group on Thursday, 4/19, beginning at 9:00 am with you, Vince.   I will keep you posted if I hear anything more from Scott.

Spoke with Jinbaek Kim today, and he is very excited about the offer to do a summer internship with the Research Group.  We will get his offer letter out to him tomorrow, but he has indicated a definite verbal acceptance.

I'll be in tomorrow, but off Friday.  Please call me with any questions you might have.

Thanks,
Molly

Jinbaek,

May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.

I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short
notice.

When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail
him independently and talk to him.

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Milly:  I have been asked to contact you to determine the status of the Permanent Residency application for Mr. Krishnarao.

On checking an old file for Mr. Krishnarao, I see that you started his Green Card application, based on Outstanding Researcher, in November, 1995.  There are also copies of the I-765 in the file, which I assume means that Mr. Krishnarao is already in the Adjustment of Status stage of the process?

I would appreciate you letting myself and Michelle Cash know where we are with the application at this time?  Hopefully, we are very close to completion! 

Many thanks

Would you be interested in participating in a panel discussion at @Market
Expo 2001 in Chicago Nov 28-30?  I would like to propose a discussion
similar to the following:

Proposed panel discussion -
Electronic commerce is quickly expanding the capabilities that enable the
exchange of structured derivative contracts.  Derivative contracts,
including swaps and options, embody substantial financial risks related to
both underlying market prices and creditworthiness of participants.  The
technology needed for these new derivative marketplaces includes
multi-parametric exchange functionality, rapid response to changing
preferences for exotic contract structures, and control over the exposure of
financial risk to traders.  These developments promise to bring electronic
commerce into the OTC marketplace.  This panel brings together leaders from
the field of financial risk management to discuss these emerging
capabilities.

Today's electricity markets are more challenging to predict than ever. Discover the keys to managing risk in volatile energy markets.
The conference venue is the beautiful Skamania Lodge in the scenic Columbia River Gorge--45 minutes East of Portland International Airport, Portland, Oregon.  A mind expanding setting for an executive-and professional level exchange of information and strategies concerning North American energy markets. 
Navigating Today's Energy Markets
The challenges of taming energy markets don't begin and end in California. Volatility and risk are present in every market region, forcing all participants to carefully examine the underlying factors and accurately assess their current and future market positions. 
For the 4th year, EPIS, Inc., developer of the AURORA? electric market model, has assembled a stimulating program of interest to any company exposed to energy market risks.  This year's agenda includes a detailed look at the various energy trading regions in the U.S. and Canada - an exploration of market conditions and market dynamics. 
This year's conference will feature thoughtful exchanges on:
Electric and Gas Markets - 2001 and Beyond
U.S. Markets: Crisis in the West, Emerging Issues in the East and ERCOT
Keys to U.S. Electric and Gas Forward Markets
Issues in Canadian Markets
Gas Hedging Strategies and Electric Markets
Price and Volume Volatility in Turbulent Markets
New Resources: When and Where to Develop?

You'll hear from top-level speakers representing companies that have been there - Williams Energy Marketing, FPL Energy, NYMEX, ENRON, DTE Energy, Deutsche Bank and others. Plus there will be informative "roll-up-your-sleeves" sessions on applied forecasting techniques by Williams Energy Marketing, Pinnacle West, GenerSys, Southern California Edison.

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with
any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding
our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support

Thanks. I shall attend.
 
Another quick questions. Art Varga and Praveen Kumar have been talking to us 
asking for directions regarding their energy program.
 
I have suggested they should contact you as well. Please, include me in the meeting:
I want to stay close to them as we are trying to place a number of our employees in their PH.D.

Hi Jeff and Vince!
 
Just have a second, but I wanted to give each of you as much lead time as possible.
 
Please reserve 11:30 -1:30, August 15th.  I've arranged to have Raffi Amit and Lee Goldring from the WeBI program come to make a luncheon presentation about WeBI, eFellows, Enron's participation, etc.  This will not be a pitch for $$, as we've already committed.  The hope is to engage the people at from the appropriate business units that might best benefit from participating in WeBI.
 
We're paying for it anyway, yet I haven't been able to get anyone at Enron to participate.  I've been participating so as to at least hold Enron's place "in the WeBI queue", but I'm sure we can be taking better advantage of the intellectual capital exchange our participation affords us.
 
I'll consult with you both at a later date about good "invitees"---I've reserved the Enron board room on 50.
 
...gotta run--I'll be in touch!
 
Thanks!
 
--Christie.

Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the Enron's point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

Our presentation at the SMS panel went very well. The audience asked quite a few questions.
Mac from U Penn invited me for lunch and dinner tomorrow to talk about more in details about real option valuation.

Enron was mentioned a few times in
Gary Hamel's speech in very positive way.

I heared Enron is under Sec investigation. I can imagine your
Monday meeting was not easy.

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

I have never had a chance to formally meet you but many people have said that you would be a wonderful person to talk to seek advice from.  I have a couple of directions that I am considering for careers right now (in risk management) and it would mean a lot to me to be able to sit down with you for a little bit to get your perspective.  Is there anyway I could buy you coffee or lunch sometime over the week or so?

Jim,

Thanks for your message.

We definitely plan to visit with you, as planned, next Wednesday.
We shall be flying from San Jose in the morning and we can shoot for
9:30 a.m. arrival at your office, as long as it works for you.

I shall forward your message to our lawyer and ask her to
come up with a new version of an NDA.

Look forward to meeting you next week.

Vince

Subject:	NDA and visit to Prediction

Vince,

Since we agreed in our conference call that we have not exchanged any
confidential or proprietary technical information up to this time and do
not expect to need to exchange such information in our next meeting
(your visit to Santa Fe) we would prefer not to sign an NDA covering
technical information at this time.

We would be happy to sign an NDA covering the content of the business
discussion itself.  We are happy to refrain from revealing to others
that we are talking to you and/or revealing any details about our
possible business relationship.  We would be happy to provide you with
such an NDA if you would like or you can draft one and present it to us.

We will move forward under the assumption that you agree with the
above.  Please contact me if you do not.

Given events in Enron that were announced today are we still on for the
5th and will Greg still be coming?

Ed,

I am sure I shall screw up sooner or later (given my aging brain and
amount of work). This  guy will have to change his name
to Ed Krapels to stay employed.

I think this other guy used to be named John Smith but changed his name to

Ed,

I am still here.
Kaminski is a very popular Polish name.

My next stage in life, when it happens , is a small cottage

Frank,

Greg Whalley and I are planning another trip to a California.
The trip is most likely to take place on the 16th - 17th of August
or a week later (23rd - 24th of August). Are you available for an afternoon
meeting and / or dinner on Thursday, August 16 or August 23? 

We are very interested in your thoughts about the directions of the power 
markets across the US.

Vince Kaminski

Dear all,

Following up with Vince's meeting on full requirement, we might just start with the existing Psim model.
The attached spreadsheet  is still running !

You need to create a directory H:\projects\pwrsim before your run the model.  If you want to re-run the model,
you need to close the report because re-run causes the program re-write the report.

Let us first review what is already there in the PSIM model, if we can live with the simplistic dispatch
logic in PSIM, the PSIM is the deliverable product for the full requirement deal. 

Alex agrees to write an agenda for this project before the Friday meeting.

Zimin

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Hey Vince,

Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think
it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially
having been on such a round table discussion.

I've been teaching a "real options" course that has the students performing
monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along
with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your
new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.
However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is
particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option
pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually
figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.

This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented
themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you
and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you
recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?

His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would
preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is
George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a
particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.

Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
much.

TheMarket for Lemons and the Price of Dishonesty=20
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded thisyear to three economi=
sts: George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz and Michael Spence,who made significan=
t contributions to modeling markets with information asymmetry.In many case=
s in a given market sellers or buyers may have exclusiveinformation that is=
 not available to the counter party. The best-known examplecomes from the [=
paper by Akerlof, The Market for "Lemons": QualityUncertainty and the Marke=
t Mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84,(1970), pages 488-500. =20
An owner of a used car can form a good idea of the qualityof his vehicle. H=
e has much better information if his car is a lemon. As bothgood and bad us=
ed car have to sell at the same price - it is impossible for anaverage buye=
r to distinguish between good and bad merchandise - they sellers ofgood use=
d cars are driven out of the market. Most traded used cars will belemons. O=
f course, there are ways to mitigate the problem: an owner of a goodused ca=
r may send signal to the buyer by offering him a guarantee or absorbingthe =
cost of inspection.=20
Hiring is a similardecision. As Michael Spence wrote in his paper Job Marke=
t Signaling,Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87, (1973), pages 355 - 374, to=
 hire somebodyis frequently to purchase a lottery ticket. The employer cann=
ot directlyobserve the productivity of a potential hire. "What he does obse=
rve is aplethora of personal data in the form of observable characteristics=
 andattributes of the individual, and it is these that must ultimately dete=
rminehis assessment of the lottery he is buying." The observable characteri=
stics of an individual may be immutable (raceand, generally, sex) but in so=
me cases certain attributes are alterable. A candidatecan modify such chara=
cteristics as education and job history. Some economistssay, tongue-in-chee=
k, that some candidates who attended top schools and spentmany painful hour=
s studying useless subjects signal their willingness to dowhatever it takes=
 to succeed. Another way to send a signal about one's qualityis to find a j=
ob with a top firm at the beginning of one's career and tosucceed in this f=
irm before moving on. This provides a useful lesson to anybodywho plans to =
be in the labor market at some points in his or her life: thereputation of =
the current employer is critical to future employmentopportunities and shou=
ld be defended at any cost. Honesty, at the end of theday, is an imperative=
 dictated as much by morality as by one's self interest. =20

Subject:	directions for June 21-22

If you have not yet registered for the June 21-22 conference, please do so
to help our planning and to obtain contact information for you.

I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual.

If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at your
hotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one at
the meeting room.  Detailed directions can be found on the website but here
is a summary from Highway 101 North & South:

      Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino
      Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.
Stay
      in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus.  At the
four-way
     stop, turn right onto Campus Drive.  Take first left (Lasuen Street)
and drive
     to the end and park.  Conference site is at this building.  If you do
not yet have
     a parking permit, we will give you one there.

I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.
Hill

I know you are focusing on agricultural products for trading, so I just wanted to know if we are looking at Wool.  I know that it's traded in Australia and New Zealand, so we might be able to look into it as well.  Please let me know.  Thank you.

Vince,
You may have already thought about this, but I thought it was an interesting way to look at the problem.

The Mirage of a Growing Fuel Supply  
By EVAR D. NERING  
COTTSDALE, Ariz. - When I discussed the exponential function in the first-semester calculus classes that I taught, I invariably used consumption of a nonrenewable natural resource as an example. Since we are now engaged in a national debate about energy policy, it may be useful to talk about the mathematics involved in making a rational decision about resource use.  
In my classes, I described the following hypothetical situation. We have a 100-year supply of a resource, say oil - that is, the oil would last 100 years if it were consumed at its current rate. But the oil is consumed at a rate that grows by 5 percent each year. How long would it last under these circumstances? This is an easy calculation; the answer is about 36 years.  
Oh, but let's say we underestimated the supply, and we actually have a 1,000-year supply. At the same annual 5 percent growth rate in use, how long will this last? The answer is about 79 years.  
Then let us say we make a striking discovery of more oil yet - a bonanza - and we now have a 10,000-year supply. At our same rate of growing use, how long would it last? Answer: 125 years.  
Estimates vary for how long currently known oil reserves will last, though they are usually considerably less than 100 years. But the point of this analysis is that it really doesn't matter what the estimates are. There is no way that a supply-side attack on America's energy problem can work.  
The exponential function describes the behavior of any quantity whose rate of change is proportional to its size. Compound interest is the most commonly encountered example - it would produce exponential growth if the interest were calculated at a continuing rate. I have heard public statements that use "exponential" as though it describes a large or sudden increase. But exponential growth does not have to be large, and it is never sudden. Rather, it is inexorable.  
Calculations also show that if consumption of an energy resource is allowed to grow at a steady 5 percent annual rate, a full doubling of the available supply will not be as effective as reducing that growth rate by half - to 2.5 percent. Doubling the size of the oil reserve will add at most 14 years to the life expectancy of the resource if we continue to use it at the currently increasing rate, no matter how large it is currently. On the other hand, halving the growth of consumption will almost double the life expectancy of the supply, no matter what it is.  
This mathematical reality seems to have escaped the politicians pushing to solve our energy problem by simply increasing supply. Building more power plants and drilling for more oil is exactly the wrong thing to do, because it will encourage more use. If we want to avoid dire consequences, we need to find the political will to reduce the growth in energy consumption to zero - or even begin to consume less.  
I must emphasize that reducing the growth rate is not what most people are talking about now when they advocate conservation; the steps they recommend are just Band-Aids. If we increase the gas mileage of our automobiles and then drive more miles, for example, that will not reduce the growth rate.  
Reducing the growth of consumption means living closer to where we work or play. It means telecommuting. It means controlling population growth. It means shifting to renewable energy sources.  
It is not, perhaps, necessary to cut our use of oil, but it is essential that we cut the rate of increase at which we consume it. To do otherwise is to leave our descendants in an impoverished world.

Eric,

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

I don't think a transfer is an issue
that  should be brought up during a hospital visit.
Zhiyong  does not need any more stress (I speak

Vince,
 
I talked to Sean, and asked him to prepare Zhiyong for our meeting with him.
Zhiyong and Sean had an agreement that Zhiyong would support Sean when the
time comes for Sean to transfer to Research.  
 
Unfortunitely Zhiyong can not make it for Friday's meeting because I just heard he
had a car accident and may stay in hospital for a week (flower?).  Sean will visit Zhiyong
in the hospital and will bring up this issue. I think as long as we allow Sean to have
enough time for his transition (help Zhiyong out), Zhiyong would agree. If Zhiyong did
not make any noise, things should be just fine.
 
 
Zimin
 
PS: Thanks for the support you have been giving me. I think that Paulo and I will work out
things to maximize the Research value.

Please review the attached documents and provide us comments by COB  tomorrow, Wednesday, December 19, to assist in finalizing EEI  and the Alliance of Energy Suppliers  filing in the Market Based Rate  proceedings.  Attached you will find a market assessment and impact  predictions of noted economists, Bill Hogan and Steve Harvey.  
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at alliance@eei.org  or (202) 508-5098
 
 
EEI's Comments/Recommendations on Hogan/Harvey  Paper
The theoretical discussion (from the second full paragraph on page 3  through the end of page 5) should be moved to the end as a technical  appendix.  I'm concerned that if it stays in its current place, readers  will be thrown off track and maybe even stop there.
 
The last two paragraphs of section III.A. are very hard to read (page  7).  Whether they are necessary is a question I have not yet  considered.
 
Their advisement against price caps (see section V.i. at pages 19-20) will  run counter against some of our wires members.
 
Their recommended alternatives (section VI, pages 20-23) are only loosely  tied to my work request.  I am uncomfortable with proposals related to  plant divestiture for large sellers (pages 21-22) and minimum interconnection  standards (page 22.)
 
On another front, a comment came in suggesting that the definition of  incremental cost should include accelerated (physical) depreciation.

Subject: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966
X-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"


Dear Colleague:

Eric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&T Labs,
with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.
We thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are
a very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that
they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.
In this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal
of the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some
comments about the nature of the job applied for.

We know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the
process as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser
from your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:

  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966

Via this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.
Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for
this particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,
and the processing occurs automatically and immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying
to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending
the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and
not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes
the entire subject line in your reply message.
If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter
will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless
you ask that it be treated as fixed-format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please
note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be
distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you
wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html
for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:

This student has applied for a summer internship.
We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.


Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Ken Lyons,

Hi Vince!
 
How are you? This is just a brief note to let you know I'm very much enjoying my time here at Carnegie Mellon. Adapting to the student lifestyle after working for three years was a bit discouraging at the beginning, but with time I began to appreciate it. This is the second week of our second mini-semester... I am finding the finance related coursework a good review, and the math and programming related coursework very interesting and useful. Our class is very small, approximately 30 people. I really miss Houston and Enron... Pittsburgh is a nice city, although I have little time to truly explore what it has to offer. 
 
I hope you're doing well. 
 
Sincerely,
 
-Hector

         I apologize for the lateness of this notice, but we are offering
our first "Econophysics" course this fall.  The course announcement from
Joe McCauley is attached.  If there are any individuals there who might
want to take or sit in on the course, they can do so as Post Bac. students
with minimal complications...  We will have our Econophysics program web
site up shortly, and I will send you the URL when that happens.

Correction to the last message...

The Colloquium at 3:00 PM on Tuesday, Sept. 25 will be:

COLLOQUIUM TITLE
My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
Adventures on Wall St
Nigel Goldenfeld
Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
1110 West Green St
Urbana
IL 61801
http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel

Abstract
Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
employers of physicists? What is the
quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
might academic physicists gain
experience of real world applications? And
why bother? I discuss these and
other questions in light of my own
experience, starting a software company
to market ultra-fast tools for risk
management of derivative securities.







Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in "Econophysics."  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an "Econophysics" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

Hi Paula,

Thanks for the invitation. I have already accepted an invitation 
from my neighbors. I shall stop by to deliver the card (or maybe I should

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information
regarding this new release..

FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The
accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.
If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible
backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo,
Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional
details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.

@ENERGY (Basics)
European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a
jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options
(see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options
(see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
 Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation
of complex compound options.

If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward
compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and
Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
	@ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed
to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used
in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.

@ENERGY (Basics)
	APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
	No change.

@ENERGY (Weather)
	Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.

@ENERGY (Swing)
	Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all
periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in
beta release.

	Bug fixes:
1)	if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum
daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case).
2)	in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period
changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects).
3)	strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.

New Excel Templates
	The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:

powercalib.xls	examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.

Add-in Manager
Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and
function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the
documentation get displayed.

Ken,

We called Tom Limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to
Enron. It seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf. It's rather
a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different
problems of interest to potential customers. 

We talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could
demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions.

They promised to get back to us in a few days.

Vince

Oil Companies Find Output Targets Elusive =20
    Big oil companies are failing to meet production growth targets because=
=20
they are using up mature fields faster than they can find and develop big=
=20
enough new ones to replace them, according to analysts. ExxonMobil, Shell,=
=20
and Chevron have all missed output targets, despite the incentive of two=20
years of high oil prices. ExxonMobil planned a 3% annual growth target last=
=20
year but its output for the second quarter of 2001 was flat versus a year=
=20
ago. Shell reported that its 2nd quarter production increased by only 1%,=
=20
well short of the 5% target. Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an=
=20
average rate of about 5% per year, and that has to be replaced by an=20
equivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady. From 1998 t=
o=20
2000 the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace th=
e=20
oil and natural gas they produced with new reserves, after stripping out th=
e=20
effect of acquisitions and revisions, according to Andersen management=20
consulting. BP posted one of the best performances, replacing 200% of its=
=20
natural gas production and 86% of its oil. Shell replaced only 42% of its=
=20
natural gas and 55% of its oil, according to Andersen. BP has set the most=
=20
ambitious production growth target of 5.5% for this year up 7% for the long=
er=20
term.
=20
From http://www.enerfax.com (Sunday, August 19, 2001):
=20
Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower
    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.064 l=
ower Friday to $3.303 per MMBtu as traders squared short positions now that=
 Tropical Storm Chantal will miss the GulfCoast. The October contract lost =
$0.081 to $3.334 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Chantal will affect the YucatanP=
eninsulaearly this week and then move into the central Gulf but is a noneve=
nt. Some traders wanted their positions cleared in preparation for next wee=
k's AGA storage report as they do not trust last week's reported build of j=
ust 3 Bcf, and believe that the AGA may report a higher build this week to =
compensate. A lot of traders got burned by last week's report and are begin=
ning to doubt the whole system. But, others look at the data as just a one-=
week blip brought about by a crescendo of events that no longer exist and d=
o represent not a long-term shift. However, if Wednesday's AGA injection is=
 low again this week, look for the market to rally to a higher level, but i=
n the meantime it will be controlled by the storm entering the Gulf of Mexi=
co. Look for support in the $3.15-$3.20 range and again at $3.00. Resistanc=
e is pegged at $3.40 and again around $3.60. Natural gas for next day deliv=
ery across the USand Canadawas generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natura=
l gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.20 to $3.24 per MMB=
tu.

Gulf South Hold Open Season for Gulf Pines Pipeline=20
   =20
    Gulf South Pipeline is planning to build a pipeline extending from Mobi=
leBayto North Carolinaif it receives enough interest. An open season for ca=
pacity on the Gulf Pines Pipeline is being currently being held. Gulf South=
 Pipeline, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, is owned by Entergy-Koch. If com=
pleted, Gulf Pines would be 600 - 700 miles long, and would extend through =
Georgia, South Carolinaand North Carolina. Anticipating an in-service date =
of summer 2004, Gulf South is soliciting binding and non-binding bids for c=
apacity on Gulf Pines through September 19th. The pipeline would offer an i=
nterconnection with Gulf South near MobileBay, allowing customers to source=
 supply from Texasand Louisianaas well as from MobileBay. The Gulf South sy=
stem also offers links to major storage and supply hubs.

Gas Daily reports this proposed pipeline may have a capacity of 1 bcf per d=
ay.  It also gives the following website for additional information:  http:=

Natural Gas Market Ponders Storage Report
 =20
    While some were questioning the accuracy of this week's astonishingly l=
ow natural gas storage report, others blamed Tropical Storm Barry and highe=
r demands from new power generation load. However, both the futures and cas=
h markets jumped. Futures closed up $0.374 the day the report was announced=
, and the cash market rose $0.20 - $0.40 the day after. Some chose to not b=
elieve the 3 Bcf storage fill reported by the AGA, chalking it up to bad da=
ta. The average amount injected during a week in August is over 60 Bcf. The=
 prior week's fill was 80 Bcf. Factoring in Barry and the prolonged heat wa=
ve that week, the market had been expecting a somewhat lower number, but al=
l had predicted something above 50 Bcf. There are various reports and theor=
ies. Buyers for northeastern utilities said they had all injected and were =
shocked by the minus 12 Bcf storage number reported for the East. They coul=
d not entirely dismiss it, however. They noted that in the last 4 years all=
 the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities. Last =
week could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the marke=
t. The AGA says they checked and re-checked when they came up with the unbe=
lievable number. The AGA's numbers have always lined up with the more exten=
sive EIA reports. It is possible that a number of factors came together all=
 at once, with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation l=
oads because of Eastern heat wave. However, the curve in the cash market ha=
s been going down. That may mean that if there is a market opportunity to m=
ove volumes from storage to a consumer right now, that could be done, assum=
ing 4 or 5 weeks later it could be replaced at the same price or maybe even=
 less. Also, there is speculation that the pipelines were re-packing their =
lines with volumes out of storage because of a sudden draw down.

Greg,

Congratulations on your new role in Eron!

We realize that your schedule might well be in turmoil as a result of
changes going on, and wanted to check on the solidity of the Wed Sept 5
Santa Fe meeting.

Let us know if it changes, and if it is far more convenient for you to have
us come to Houston again, we are also open to this.  We continue to be
excited about the possibilities of getting together on a project.

    Best regards,
    Norman

Laura,

Given Greg Whalley's schedule, the best day for us to visit with you at Santa Fe
would be Wednesday, September the 5th. WE would arrive from San Francisco, early in the morning
and we could stay through the day.

Please, let me know if this date would work for you.

Vince,

I have heard back from Dave Weinberger regarding the date of your
visit.  He is available both days but prefers the 31st.  Please let me
know as soon as possible which day you have chosen for your visit.

Thank you,

Vince,

I am just trying to make sure that all of the data is clean for your PRC meeting on Wednesday, and noticed that although Shane Green and Chris Pernoud are both specialist, Shane is Commercial Support (CS) and Chris is Specialized Technical (ST).  Please let me know if this is correct or if they should both either be ST or CS.  I am assuming that they should both be CS since the Sr. Specialist are all ST.  Additionally, I just wanted to let you know that the following people will not be rated during the meeting because their hire date was after December 31, 2000:
Anguel Grigorov
Wichai Narongwanich
Chris Pernoud
Leann Walton

Finally, please verify that you do want to do rank the assistants tomorrow.  As you know, ranking the assistants is not required, but is a business unit leader decision.  

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

Vince/Shirley:

I regret to inform that I am terminating my job with Enron today 12/06/2001. Despite the later events I had a great time working with everyone in this company. More particularly, I will miss a lot of the excitement and learning opportunities that The Research propitiated in this last 3 years.

I will be pursuing new opportunities in a different company and as soon as I settle I will inform my new contact info. I will still be residing here in Houston I and I am looking forward to continuing nurturing the friendship we developed throughout these years.

Many thanks.

	Vince - 

	Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group.  Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year.  Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer.  What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer. 

	When we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group.

	Is this okay with you?

	Hope all is well  with you 

	Take Care

		Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
		It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
		Thank you for your time.

		I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.

		I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.

Ian,

My secretary contacted SMS. I was surprised that they want to charge 
me for the conference. Typically, the speakers are invited to attend without incurring
the cost of a conference. The is the first invitation to speak I received, combined with a request to pay for

I'm Presly's daughter, Jill.  I believe that he had told you I would be
sending my resume your way.  I am interested in the Associate HR and Analyst
program that Enron offers.  I have actually spoken with someone in Hr
regarding the program.  Her name is Adrianne Engel.  I have not heard from
her any further at this point.

I have been trying to get into the HR field here in Austin and it has been
very tough in this tight market.  I would love the opportunity to interview
with Enron.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Dear Vince

I recently saw an announcement of Enron's risk management chair at Rice
University.  Do you know about it or the people at Rice?  While I'm having a
great time working with Swiss Re here, I am thinking about coming home for
my wife's sake.  Do you think that Rice would be open to a person in risk
management with an insurance as well as a finance background?  That was
certainly not true at Texas and that's why I'm asking.

I hope all is well there with you.  I did appreciate your presentation to my
finance classes there at the University of Texas a couple of years ago.  I
also appreciated the assistance that you recently gave one of my Texas Ph.
D. students.  He was and I still am working on pricing weather derivatives.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*	a general energy risk related topic
*	a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*	your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

Vince,

I work with Jayshree Desai and Mark Wadlington in Corporate Development.  I know you are compiling a great deal of information, however, I have one question.  I am working to gather the market size information for the various markets, and I am having difficulty finding the size of the fixed income market.  Would someone in your group have this information or have any suggestions on places to look?

Thank you,

It must be great to be a management guru and never be wrong.


Before (excerpts from Leading the Revolution):

*	"Want to build a great Internet portal site?  Sorry, its too late.  If you're an incumbent like Sony or Bertelsmann and you want to grab a few million eyeballs online, you're going to have to write a check to for a zillion dollars or so and give it to a twenty-something kid who's managing a company that is haemorrhaging cash.  Or maybe you'll get lucky and Yahoo! will buy you."

*	"Never has incumbency been worth less. . . . The Internet has turned bricks and mortar into millstones.  And venture capitalists pour millions of dollars into terrorist training camps for industry insurgents."

*	"Consumers aren't going to spend the rest of their lives wandering the soulless canyons of Wal-Mart to save a couple of bucks on a hammer. . . . And all those "big box" retailers afloat in a sea of asphalt will one day find themselves out of the Internet-enabled revolution.  With only one or two exceptions, there is not a single market leader in the offline retailing world that leads its category online.  Most of the old-line companies just didn't move quickly enough."

*	"Go to any grocery retailer and ask to see its strategic plan from a few years back.  I'll bet there's no mention of Bechtel as a potential competitor.  Yet the world's largest construction company is helping Webvan, a start-up build a new distribution infrastructure that will support the home delivery of groceries ordered online."

*	"Administrators posses an exaggerated confidence in great execution, believing this is all you need to succeed in a discontinuous world."

I assume that the next edition of Gary's book will contain a few more caveats and qualifiers such as ". . . but don't be dumb."

Features/E-Corp/The Think Tank; Inside The Revolution Smart Mover, Dumb Mover Think the first-mover advantage is a myth?
You're wrong: Most pioneering dot-coms failed not because they were first but because they were dumb.
Gary Hamel

I'm not fond of business aphorisms. Bigger is better, content is king, own the customer, cannibalize yourself--these are just a few of the cliches that trivialize complex business issues. Another is the idea of first-mover advantage, with its promise of extraordinary rewards for any company that is first to market with a new service or product. At the height of dot-com mania, first-mover advantage was a near-sacred mantra for VCs and entrepreneurs alike. E-commerce zealots argued that early success would compound even more quickly on the Web than in the dawdling old economy. Being first to build a consumer brand in a new category (Amazon), invent a new business model (eBay), or achieve critical mass (what Webvan was hoping to do) were seen as surefire routes to Midas-like profits.

In reality, of course, first-mover advantages proved illusory. For most dot-com startups, being first was simply a way to lose more, faster.  Many pundits began to argue that being a fast follower was a better strategy than trying to be the leader. Old-economy CEOs, eager to avoid the hard work of strategic innovation, seized upon this diagnosis to justify their instinctive fear of novelty. Suddenly, timidity was heralded as a virtue.

But the fast-follower advocates had it wrong as well. Most Internet companies failed not because they were first movers but because they were dumb movers. What companies should learn from the Internet debacle is not that being first is a dangerous form of hubris but that being dumb seldom succeeds. When it comes to trailblazing, there are at least three ways to be a dumb mover--none of which is unique to Internet startups.

Dumb: Getting your timing wrong   If a company invests faster than it learns, it will over-drive the opportunity and end up with an expensive and embarrassing failure.  That's the fate that befell Apple's pioneering handheld computer, the Newton. Was there a potential market out there for palm computers? Sure.  Could investment and marketing hype alone force the market to develop on Apple's time frame? No. Companies that over-drive an emerging opportunity often under-drive it later on. The initial performance gap, a product of unrealistic expectations and over- investment, produces a rapid retrenchment--and an opening for latecomers.

There is a market-penetration curve for every emerging opportunity.  Typically, this curve has an inflection point: a moment when all the pieces of the business model finally fall into place, customer demand explodes, and the market takes off. For videocassette recorders, the curve began to slope gently upward with the launch of Matsushita's VHS format in the late '70s, yet it would take another seven years for VCRs to find their way into one million American homes. By contrast, the market-penetration curve for Hotmail was a near vertical line, with more than ten million users signing up in the first 18 months. Matsushita ran a marathon. Hotmail ran a sprint. The Apple Newton might have evolved into something Palm-like, but only if Apple had paced itself by spending less, learning faster, and iterating more quickly. Apple blew the handheld opportunity not because it was the first mover but because it was a dumb mover.

Any management team that aspires to be a first mover must ask itself, What race are we running: sprint or marathon? If you try to run a 100-yard sprint like a marathon, you'll be left behind. If you try to run a marathon like a 100-yard sprint, you'll keel over from exhaustion.  So it is critically important to ask some questions: Are there difficult technical hurdles? Does market takeoff depend on the development of complementary products or services? Will a new infrastructure be required? Will customers need to learn new skills or adopt new behaviors? Are there high switching costs for customers? Will competing standards confuse customers? Are there powerful competitors that will seek to delay or derail us? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, a company must be careful not to pour in too many resources too soon; the race is going to be a marathon.

On the other hand, answer yes to all of these questions, and you'll need to sprint out of the starting block: Are the customer benefits clear and substantial? Are there potential network effects that will accelerate takeoff? Are there powerful competitors that will be compelled to follow?

Staying on the optimal penetration curve--neither over-driving nor under-driving an opportunity--is a neat trick, but it's not impossible.  AOL, Sun Microsystems, and Quicken-maker Intuit have all done it at one time or another. Smart movers continually review their initial assumptions about the business model, avoid the premium pricing and narrow market definition that create space for latecomers, move quickly to collaborate with would-be competitors, and outsource to maintain flexibility.

Dumber: Overpaying for market share  The allure of capturing a first-mover advantage often produces a spending orgy among a gaggle of look-alike competitors, each intent on ramping up faster than its rivals. That is exactly what happened in many areas of e-commerce. Services were given away free, ad budgets were doubled and then tripled, and massive investments were made in IT infrastructure--all in the quest of getting bigger, faster. In such cases, it's easy to overpay for market share.

To reap a first-mover advantage, a company must buy market share at a discount. That is, it must be able to buy a big chunk of market share before its competitors figure out just how much that share will yield in future profits. That is possible only if a company has a business idea that is truly original, as did eBay and ICQ (the Israeli company that invented instant messaging and was later acquired by AOL).

The fact is, the Internet didn't produce too much in the way of authentic business-model innovation, but rather too little. And even when an original idea did surface, it didn't stay original for long, thanks to the incessant, incestuous networking among Silicon Valley's venture capital companies. The moral is simple: If you want to profit from a first-mover advantage, you'd better make sure you start with a unique strategic insight that, at least initially, is unattractive to would-be competitors or protected by a wall of patents. Dumb movers swarm; smart movers don't.

Dumbest: Being first with a business model that's DOA  Pets.com. Iridium. Webvan. Northpoint.   Many business models are brain-dead from the get-go. They breathe as long as they are hooked up to the ventilator of investor funds but expire the moment investors swallow their grief and pull the plug. There are two fundamental flaws that can render a business model DOA: a complete misreading of the customer (does she really want to order dog food online?) and utterly unsound economics (there will never be enough petroleum geologists and Arctic explorers to make satellite telephony pay). There's no advantage in being first if the destination ain't worth the trip.

Not that this should be seen as an argument for always staying behind. A stupid idea that fails is hardly an indictment of the notion of first-mover advantage. Think twice before you let someone else's idiocy lull you into believing that being first is always a peril-strewn path.  Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first in overnight package delivery, or Andy Grove at Intel (microprocessors), or Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines (discount air travel), or Pete Kight at CheckFree (online billing and payment), or Jeff Skilling at Enron (energy trading).

I don't believe any company should set out to be a follower, fast or otherwise. Sure, in hindsight, first movers often look dumb, but it would be imprudent to bet that they will always screw up. Indeed, when you look beyond the lunacy of the Internet bubble and consider companies with high-quality management, deep pockets, and real competencies, you find that being first pays off a surprisingly often.

So before you bet against the first mover, you'd be wise to ask yourself, Am I sure the first mover is going to be a slow learner? Will market penetration stay in single digits for some time to come, giving me time to grab customers later on? Will the rate of technology change remain high, creating opportunities for a leapfrog strategy? Will the first mover fail in signing up the most valuable partners? If you can answer yes to all these questions, then you may have the chance to be a
successful second mover.

In the end, the distinction between first mover and fast follower hides more than it reveals. The goal, after all, is not to be first to market in some absolute sense, but to be first to put together the precise combination of features, value, and sound business economics that unlocks a profitable new market. Sometimes the company that does this is the first mover, and sometimes it is not. But it's always the smart mover.

Makes sense. The customers were engaging in risk reducing trades to lower
their exposure.

I am curious about the most recent volumes.

Vince,

I thought you might just like to have this information: several people have been asking about our trading volumes and whether or not they have decreased significantly. According to the graphs in the attached spreadsheet, the only significant drop in EOL trading came on 09/11 and 09/12. In fact, the largest number of transactions on EOL was on 10/23, which is since many of our problems started.

Subject:	An Interview Request by Maureen Raymond

Vince:

Maureen asked me to set up an interview with you for a summer intern that has
been displaced a couple of times, first with EES and then with EBS.  She evidently
wants him to assist her.  He has some economics in his background.  His name is
Salah M. Mattoo..

Do you want to do this?   I am afraid we don't have any space for him and if we put
him somewhere else, he will not be much help to Maureen.

Let me know.

Shirley

Paul,
 
I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmed
that he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did not
receive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue.
 
I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.
He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers
who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal 
relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.
 
My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his social
intelligence.
 
 
Vince

Thank you for the clarification -  this is not the case presented to me by Christian and he has been obtuse to the point of deception with regard to this matter.
This lead to my conclusion that Houston was poaching and hence my blunt email to you - I apologise.
I am still sick but will call you next week to discuss the correct way of moving forward.

Subject: RE: Christian



Paul,
 
I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.
 
1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)
    last Friday, as far as I can remember.
 
    Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:
       a. We would be delighted to have him here.
       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives
           your blessing before we can move ahead.
    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and
    Mike Roberts.
 
  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you
      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and 
      asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was
      told you were out sick.
 
 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next
     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.
 
 4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to
     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not 
     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.
 
     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the
     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.
 
I hope it helps. Cheers.
 
 
Vince

I have spoken to Christian and explained to him that he is critical to our local operations and should provide 100% focus on his role here.  As a small office it would be devestating for us should Christian be lured away.  I would appreciate you calling me rather than working through Christian on this matter.

The  Jones School has a newly designed website: please take a look at http://jonesgsm.rice.edu .  Look more than  once, please, because the homepage changes each time you visit.

It was a pleasure speaking to you.  I appreciate the information you provided and your guidance on the opportunities at Enron.  As you recommended, my chances would be greatly enhanced if with your assistance other managers review my credentials.  

I would be very grateful if you could communicate my interest to Mr. Vince Kaminsky.  I am certain my qualifications would be a good fit for a number of positions in his division.

I have also applied for the associate program and perhaps you could advise me on how be considered for the program.

My resume is attached.  Once again I sincerely appreciate your assistance. 

Best regards,



Thea Jokhadze

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

David,

I regret to inform you I am unable to attend the conference due to previous commitments.
Would you consider a speakers form our London office?

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

Vince,

Regarding everything we talked today in all research meeting I was wondering how all these things are going to affect my situation. As we talked couple months ago I was trying to get ready to be employed full time in the new year. So in this case what do you recommend me to do? Shall we stick to what we talked before or shall we wait and see what time is going to bring? It'd be really nice if you could give some kind of direction.
Thanks,

Subject:	Virus Alert: Magistrad Worm


The Magistrad Worm

    Systems affected: PCs with Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT/2000 with poor
security

    Method of propagation:  E-mail attachment; when opened it attaches
itself to Windows executable files and sends itself to e-mail recipients.
It can grab e-mail recipient addresses from Outlook, Outlook Express,
Netscape and/or Microsoft Internet Mail and News.

    Risk to the Rice campus:  High. It spreads quickly, and it can damage
or destroy files and damage the system BIOS. It does not attack document
files specifically.

Hi again, it's Rick Russell your local virus guy. Two e-mail messages to
ALLDEPTS this morning contained this vicious virus. The virus affects PC
systems with Windows 9X/NT/2000, not Macs or UNIX systems.

For all the details, visit:

   http://www.rice.edu/Computer/Computing/Virus/magistr.htm

This virus does not execute unless you open the attached files. So, if you
didn't open the attachments, you're fine. If you did and you're using a PC
system with some version of Windows, please contact IT staff for help
immediately. Contact information is included on the above web page.

Please do NOT open attachments without confirming their validity.
Confirmation might include a second e-mail with an exact description of
the attachment contents (including file names and sizes), a telephone
call, or a face-to-face meeting. NEVER open attachments with EXE in the
filename.

Please do not distribute this e-mail outside the Rice community, or
forward it after June 15, 2001.

Yours truly,

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

I am not surprised you have no attendees from Enron.
We can pay neither  for the conference nor for the trip to New York.
I shall be glad to talk to you about the conference but I cannot attend in any capacity.

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
Ehud

This would be Kinoshita.  As indicated below I would certainly like to price a live deal, get Shankman to agree and go out with an offer.  Since not too big, eduction should not be too costly.  Could also collar if required.  If we can handle JCC and RIM then there is much available in the domestic markets.

Vince,

Nothing like a real deal to focus our thoughts on JCC.  JA Aichi is an agricultural association that purchases over 200,000kl per year of Heavy A.  They would like Enron to price a JCC swap (our offer) that would help them manage their Oct 2001 to Mar 02 position as given below.  I'd like to see what we could offer given the volumes and term.  We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.

It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.

Let me know if you need additional info.  I presume that you are fairly far along with evaluation of JCC and that we should be able to derive an offer?  If not, please let me know.  If possible we'd like to send out an offer next week.

thanks.

Joe

                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)

Hi, How are you doing ? 

Have received an inquiry form JA Aichi (Different from UNICOOP) in Japan as follows: 

In order to hedge the price of Low Sulphur A, they want to enter the swap based on 
Crude Oil Index or Gas Oil Index, since it has a correlation with the product. 
It would be very appreciated if you could give me a price as following. 

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : Dubai Crude Oil, Platts Singapore Gas Oil Reg. 0.5% 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

Hello Vince,

It was good to talk with you yesterday. David Rowe and I will be happy to
meet with you for breakfast at 7:00 on Tuesday. I will call on Monday to
set the location.

The URL for our commodity option calculator demonstration is

	http://perun.otci.net/Utility

Note that several of the data sets, which we obtain daily from NYMEX, are
incomplete. NG, HO, CN, NT and CL have enough data to indicate performance.
The others are either missing altogether or the series is too short to be
useful.

If you want to see the currency demonstration, it is at

	http://perun.otci.net/BC

and includes some technical material describing work we did in creating the
site.

With best regards,

Mike Boughton

   Dear Vince

   Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently
   inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia,
   which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an
   opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
   programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as
   possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.

   I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852
   2545
   2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.

   Kind regards.

   Philip

Good morning Vince!

I'm sorry that I wasn't here when you sent the e-mail yesterday...  too many meetings in and out of the building.

I had looked into this problem several months ago for a Canadian problem and I'll have to look through my notes to see what I was thinking at the time.

I can be reached at (713) 654-4032.  (I guess you noticed that they removed me from peoplefinder.  We are oh so spooky around here.)

Greetings. 

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us 
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at 
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was. 

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of 
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the 
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your 
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a 
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other 
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public 
Affairs Mike Rosen. 

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I 
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26, 
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule 
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would 
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or 
whether you would prefer a subset thereof. 

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is 
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy 
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.: 
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters. 

Best,

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eHvU0BHCKe0CjE0CwR0Ar
This week's economic, banking and P&C insurance news, from an enterprise risk management perspective. Read it here ...

ANALYSIS
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eHvU0BHCKe0CjE0B4V0An
Why managing intellectual property risks is getting more challenging.
Will lead-based paint suits be "the next asbestos" for US insurers?
Is the idea of deposit insurance reform dead, or just sleeping?

BASLE SPECIAL 1
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eHvU0BHCKe0CjE0B4W0Ao
Confused about the new Basle Capital Accord? Look no further. Over the next two weeks, we'll be presenting a quick guide to all you need to know before the May 31 deadline for responses to the consultation document. In our first article this week, Rob Jameson introduces the major themes, proposals and controversies of Basle II.

BASLE SPECIAL 2
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eHvU0BHCKe0CjE0B4W0Ao
In the second of our special Basle guide, Alan McNee outlines the key problems with the proposals, from market discipline and operational risk to credit derivatives and maturity factors. More Basle coverage and analysis to come next week on ERisk.

SEARCH ENGINE
It was broken, but now we've fixed it. ERisk&#8217;s new, more powerful and efficient search engine will let you conduct more meaningful searches of the ERisk site, with relevancy scores for each result and clear identification of where each document can be found. Coming soon: a brief summary of each document found.

INTERACTIVE P&C STUDY

Dear Mike and Vince,

6th workshop for the Community Climate System Model in Breckenridge, CO. Afterwards, I will be coming to the Houston office.

Learn more about this comprehensive new software solution and how it delivers enterprise risk management analytics that effectively link risk, capital and shareholder value.

****************************************************

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://www.erisk.com/news/weekly/news_weekly2001-05-04_01.asp
This week's economic, banking and P&C insurance news, from an enterprise risk management perspective. Featuring exclusive coverage of this week&#8217;s RIMS conference in Atlanta.

ANALYSIS
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_analyses.asp
?	Who matters most - stakeholders or shareholders?
?	Risk managers neglect overseas operations at their peril.
?	Mobile banking is on the way - but will banks benefit from it?

BASLE RESOURCES
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp
Now you can find all ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive coverage of the Basle II proposals on bank capital adequacy in one place: www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp. You&#8217;ll find all our recent coverage, including features, event transcripts, news stories, interviews and analysis along with links to other resources, regulatory summaries and rating agency and industry association responses.

BASLE SPECIAL
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_features.asp
Continuing our special coverage of the proposed new regulatory capital rules, we look at Basle&#8217;s approach to operational risk. Rob Jameson explores the proposals to set a regulatory capital charge for op risk, and canvasses industry opinion on how they might work in practice.

VIEWPOINT
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_viewpoint.asp
In this special Q&A, Ashish Dev of KeyBank talks to ERisk about what his bank has discovered so far from its internal testing on the impact of the new Basle proposals. It&#8217;s too early to say for sure, but many banks may not find much reason to improve their risk management practices. You can find out Dev's perspective on the Basle proposal in our iConference archive.

ERisk PRODUCT CATALOGUE
http://www.erisk.com/store/store_product.asp
ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive Product Catalogue is a one-stop shop giving full details of the systems and services available to risk managers. From Algorithmics to Zai*Net, we list the major software vendors, data providers and consultancy firms; as well as details of where to find risk management magazines, research reports, web glossaries, training courses and certification programmes.

Vince,

I was waiting till Kevin gets back - he's cleaning up 30c2

He has a file on it all

$300 per month seems like a lot, but we use the heck out of it 

for communications daily with Tony, for video briefing preparation

I know it needed it's own server, but I want to make sure we only pay our fair share

I'll let you know accurate cost allocation as soon as kevin returns

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Diane

Tony, 

Great. Richard is a very important internal customer. 
Also, please keep in mind that for power trading in the UK
and Europe winter is the most important season.

We should be thinking about ramping up resources by then.

Hi Vince

Just thought I would bring you up to speed on conversation last week with Richard Lewis.

Turns out I had already met him briefly way back at start of March!  He is very personable and was impressed with the daily briefing I give to UK Gas which he has overheard on several occasions.

He is very keen for me to provide a daily briefing for UK Power, similar in format to current briefing for UK Gas.

He introduced me to Simon Hastings who heads up UK Power Trading Desk (similar level to Peter Crilly in UK Gas) - I will be meeting with him later this week to discuss specific UK Power weather requirements.

Initially, due to workload at this end, I will provide them with the same package as UK Gas (i.e. 1 to 5 Day temperature outlook for UK) at around 8:15 am, but they are interested in getting 1 to 5 day outlook for precipitation and illumination (cloud cover) up and running - we can work towards spinning these up in the future.

Will be spinning up a daily briefing for Softs starting on Monday, and a daily briefing for Weather Derivatives starting Mid June/July.

Best regards,

Tony

Vince: That job was for Eric Thode who is a Director of Communications here in EWS.  It has, however, been filled.  I do know that there may be another job for a manager of public relations opening up soon if you would like to have your friend to send me his resume.

Thanks,

Vince,

Please see Brett's message below.  From the plan files I can tell only that the $21,041/month allocated to Enron Europe is calculated as 2.4% of plan expenses and should be trued up to actuals.  I do not have any detail on what you do for them.  Can you answer Brett's question?

Thanks,

Subject:	Announcing Outlook Web Access for Houston Outlook Users

Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

It seems that Risk are getting out of the book publishing business to concentrate on their journals.  I have established contact with the senior commissioning editor for Wiley, who is interested in working with us to publish something like our joint Risk publication (Managing Energy Price Risk), as well as a similar title on metals.

I'm due to go on holiday from tomorrow for a couple of weeks.  Would you be interested in following up with her, or should I continue when I return from my break?
(Vince - Something you may not be aware of is that I'm moving over to trade oil derivatives when I return from my holiday for Niamh Clarke/John Nowlan.)

Given that I'm getting out of the metals business it would be appropriate for someone else to pick up the metals price risk book proposal, though I am happy to continue with it if Joe wishes.

Dear Steve

It was a pleasure meeting up with you again last week.  I enjoyed our
meeting and found it most informative - thanks for the tour of the various
trading floors.

As discussed, I would be most interested in pursuing a book on metals
trading, and more broadly, various books on the quantitative aspects of
energy trading (& related commodities). Wiley is renowned for the depth and
breadth of its finance publishing and, in particular, well-respected for
the more quantitative part of our finance list.  Such titles include
Rebonato's 'Interest Rate Option Models'; Willmott's 'Paul Willmott on
Quantitative Finance'; Taleb 'Dynamic Hedging'; Saunders 'Credit Risk
Measurement'; James/Webber 'Interest Rate Modelling'; Caouette et al
'Managing Credit Risk'; Carol Alexander's 'Risk Management' and so on.
One area that we are interesting in publishing in is in the area of energy,
in its broadest sense.  Enron is obviously a key player in this market, and
we would certainly welcome exploring various options in terms of publishing
books with Enron, Enron employees or as part of a collaboration with
various industry players.

Wiley is a publisher with an international reputation.  Within finance we
commission product from the US, Europe and Asia, under the Wiley Finance
umbrella.  A key part of our publishing strategy is to present our titles
as a seamless whole, with global sales, marketing and distribution.  Our
various sales channels include teams dedicated to servicing the needs of
the booktrade; online accounts; corporates; libraries, universities and the
increasing number of e-content providers (e.g. NetLibrary; Fat Brain etc.)

Topics of interest that initially spring to mind include:
   Managing Metals Price Risk
   Managing Energy Price Risk
   Weather Risk Management
   Books on trading, risk management etc. for specific commodities
   (broadband; electricity, natural gas, oil etc.)

When we met you discussed the possibility of putting together a book
proposal on metals, with your team at Enron.  I very much hope that you
decide to pursue this further.  For your information, I have attached our
standard new book proposal form below, as a guideline.  Finally, you also
planned on speaking with Vince Kaminski about other publishing
opportunities and book ideas.  I would be more than happy to follow up with
Vince myself if you thought this appropriate.

Once again, thanks for your time last Thursday. I very much look forward to
hearing from you.

All best wishes
Sam

New Book Proposal Form

1.  A statement of the purpose and main features of the proposed book - its
raison d'etre. (e.g. why the need for such a book; size of market;
inclusion of case studies and so on).
2.  A note of the specific types of readership the book would attract, and
why.  For example, a definition of the type of practitioner who would be
interested in the book, including job titles.
3.  Notes comparing the nearest existing books which might be thought
related or competitive.  How would your book differ?
4.  A list of chapters, with brief notes on the content of each chapter
plus an estimate of the approximate length.
5. A note, if possible, of the likely illustrative content of each chapter;
the number of tables, drawings, graphs etc.
6. Author C.V.
7.  When you would hope to deliver the manuscript, assuming the project
goes to contract.

I don't see any problems with #1. For number 2, mention that the paper was written when you were a studentt
at Rice.

Vince,

A couple of brief issues:

1) I have been asked to deliver a lecture(s) to a Rice environmental engineering class in the fall.  Most of the preparatory work for the class is already complete, so I don't foresee any large time commitment for this endeavor.  If there is a problem, let me know.

2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering.  I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies.  I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Mark,

Dan Wilchins from Reuters (646) 223 6320 asked for an interview.
I told him that all requests have to be cleared by PR first.

I would never take your job. Good luck.

Three approaches are proposed:
1. Maximizing profit.
2. Minimizing variance.
3. Minimizing value at risk (in progress, but not very promising).

John,

Thanks for you messages and for a polo shirt I got from the MBA program in Dallas
on Monday.

I am doing fine -  busy as usual. In case you missed it, and interesting article from the WSJ.

Vince

>ABSTRACT:
> Based on the peculiarities of electricity as underlying

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader
> proprietary positions to their market making activities. In
> particular, we examine interdealer trading, its function as an
> inventory management tool, and its costs. In addition, we
> develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy, where some floor
> traders, who are more successful, profit from their trades with
> other dealers. On average, we find that dealers earn relative
> profits when they execute position reducing trades. However, a
> surprising finding is that more successful traders are more
> likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades,
> which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer
> hierarchy. The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster
> and Mann's 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory
> control, and Reiss and Werner's 1998 article on interdealer
> trading. The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits
> from the elaborate futures data, and the highly competitive
> nature of dealer trading on the floor.

>ABSTRACT:
> In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer
> investors a superior risk-return trade-off. We do so using a
> continuous time version of Dybvig's (1988a, 1988b) payoff
> distribution pricing model. The evaluation model, which does not
> require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution
> of the funds in question, is applied to the monthly returns of
> 77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May
> 1990-April 2000. The results show that as a stand-alone
> investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return
> profile. We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be
> inefficient, with the average efficiency loss amounting to 2.76%
> per annum for indices and 6.42% for individual funds. Part of
> the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified
> away. Funds of funds, however, are not the preferred vehicle for
> this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their
> double fee structure. Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio

Vince, 
I've ended up interviewing 20 people in the Research Group; everyone was very cooperative and insightful.  Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned.
When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.
Thanks again for your interest and support.  I'll keep you informed of progress!
Ann Thomas

Mike,

I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation,
given our relationship with the Wharton School. I  think it can be somebody
below Steve's level - the occasion does not justify allocating
time of a senior executive.

Steve,

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates.

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

I have not heard from you for a few days and was  wondering what is happening. The last time I spoke to Shelley, everything was  fine and that you were still going ahead with your presentation and  co-presenting the workshop on energy risk.
 
Please do reply to put my mind at  rest!

Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

	Vince,

	  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
	the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
	I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
	this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
	why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
	more about this.

	  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
	and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
	implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
	and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
	PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
	%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
	is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
	that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
	Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
	software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
	unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
	PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
	for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
	a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
	the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
	only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
	that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
	to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
	imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

	  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
	East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
	to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
	the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
	mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
	It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
	the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
	profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
	prices.

	  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
	form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
	price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
	get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
	regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
	mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
	prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

	  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
	of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
	involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
	necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
	actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
	exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
	participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
	model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
	significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

	Frank

" GM  vs. Microsoft "

Thanks to - M A B

Subject: Bill Gates

Recently, Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the
auto industry and stated "If GM had kept up with the technology like the
computer industry has, we would all be driving $25 cars that got 1,000 
miles to the gallon."

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release
stating: "If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be
driving cars with the following characteristics:

l. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to
buy a new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You
would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows,
shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. 
For some reason you would simply accept this.

4. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive- but would run on only
five percent of the roads.

5. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all
be replaced by a single "General Protection Fault" warning light.

6. The airbag system would ask "are you sure" before deploying.

7. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out
and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,
turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.

8. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to
drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the
same manner as the old car.

9. You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.

Subject:	UT Short Course travel arrangements

If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, given the number of us going.  Vasant has offered to drive.  Dependiing on driving speed and traffic, leaving Houston by 9:30am should give sufficient time to make the 1pm class, including some time for lunch.

Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate plans or suggestions.

Thanks,
Martin

Rick,

I shall be honored to serve on the Advisory Board of the MSCF.

Also, I shall be able to join you on Wednesday, December 12 for the 
first meeting.

A more formal letter of acceptance will follow.

Vince,

I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating
in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in
quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is
deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward
to your visit.

On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on
our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership
(http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation
from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in
expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!

The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York.
Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enron's participation
on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program
to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a "first
look" at the "MSCF Resume Book."  From our standpoint, your experience and
counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and
opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.

Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan.
Would you be willing join us?

Rick

Hi Presly,

Thanks for the message.
Things have slowed down for me
and it's time to enjoy the summer.

I wander if you have heard from Enron's HR people?

Talk to you soon.

How are things going? We just got back in from back to back trips. Dawn had a

Hope all is well. Drop us a note when you get a chance.

Power Curve 6: Crossing the Mountaintop; Lower Outlook, Ratings


   SUMMARY VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION DATA
* We reduce earnings estimates, ratings and price
  targets for a number of our companies who are "long"
  power.  In all, we are lowering ratings on seven
  companies, price targets on thirteen, and earnings
  estimates on sixteen.
* This follows our call (Power Curve 4, published
  May 2) where we established a more cautious outlook
  for Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.
* Since our last Power Curve analysis on May 31, we
  have seen the continued deterioration of both
  forward power prices and spark spreads.
* June was the first period in which we have seen
  year/year declines in power prices and spark
  spreads.  We had expected to see these signs first
  in 1Q:02.
* We maintain a bullish outlook on those companies
  that are not leveraged to power prices, whether
  through strong risk management skills or through a
  lack of generation.  Our top two picks are ENE and
  DYN.

POWER PRICES HAVE PEAKED; WE ARE CROSSING THE MOUNTAINTOP AND NOW EXPECT A
DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT

June is the first month that we have seen negative year-on-year comparisons in
the commodity drivers that underlie earnings.  Based on work in our last Power
Curve report (Power Curve 5, 5/31/01), we had not expected the commodity
drivers of earnings to turn negative until 1Q:02.  Instead, we see commodity
comparisons turning negative in June, and on a full quarterly basis, 3Q:01.

                                       June 2001  June 2000     % Change
Power Prices ($/MWh)                     $50.21      $83.25       (40%)
Spark Spread ($/MWh)                     $23.77      $56.93       (58%)

In our view, the most important measure for earnings, particularly for Power
Producers, is the Spark Spread, which shows the gross margin potential for
power generation in the spot market.  Hedging, trading, and the sale of other
services such as capacity availability and spinning reserves offsets the impact
of a decline in this number.  Most companies with generating capacity are at
least 85% hedged for 2001, 60% hedged for 2002, and 40% hedged for 2003.

NEGATIVE QUARTERLY COMMODITY DRIVERS BEGINNING 3Q:01, TWO QUARTERS AHEAD OF
EARLIER EXPECTATIONS

Forward power and gas markets suggest that 3Q:01 will be the first full quarter
of negative commodity comparisons.  Earlier, in PC5, we had expected this would
not occur until 1Q:02.  What has surprised us is the swiftness and breadth of
the decline in the power pricing environment.  Unlike 2Q:01, which had two good
months -- April and May -- to buoy earnings, forward markets suggest year/year
declines in power prices and the spark spread for all of 3Q:01 and continuing
into 4Q:01.  June is an important "swing" month in what is normally a
relatively volatile earnings quarter.  So far, because of lower realized prices
and a declining power price outlook, a number of companies have either pre-
announced or guided to reduced earnings expectations, including:  PPL, PNW,
PNM, NRG, KSE and CEG.

Quarterly Comparisons, Power Prices and Spark Spreads

DOWNGRADING STOCKS; DECLINING POWER PRICES ARE NOT GOOD FOR EARNINGS

In a declining power pricing environment, investors should take a more cautious
stance on companies who are "long" the commodity -- i.e., companies who,
because of their business model, are making a long bet on commodity prices.
Within this constraint, we look for signs that mitigate this exposure.
Furthermore, we are positive on the long-run case for aggressive companies who
are building newer, more efficient power plants and replacing the aging plant
that has built up under 70 years of regulation.  As long-run bets, companies
such as Calpine (CPN, downgraded to 2H from 1H) offer an excellent play on
deregulation, although we temper our outlook due to declining power prices.
Certain other Power Producers are better positioned than others, and when we
add the valuation component to this discussion (the stock prices of many
Producers peaked in late April/early May), we think a number still offer
attractive value.

However, our broad thrust is to recommend companies who are not long power (or
have small exposure), whether because of strong trading and risk management
skills or a lack of generating capacity.  In Power Curve 4 (5/1/01), when we
first wrote about the declining price curve, we suggested a more cautious
stance towards Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.  We stand by that
advice.  We are downgrading the rating on only 1 Merchant vs. 4 Producers and
Integrated Utilities who are exposed to power prices.  In terms of estimates,
only 2 Merchants are being reduced, while we are reducing 14 Power Producers
and Integrated Utilities.  Our top 3 growth-oriented picks for investors who
want to avoid the impact of declining power prices are Energy Merchants ENE,
DYN and ILA.  For dividend or total-return investors, we recommend Integrated
Utilities EXC, ETR, and AEP.

MACRO VIEW:  WHY ARE POWER PRICES DECLINING?

Figure 1.  The Forward Power Curve ($/MWh) --U.S.

            1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F
  $/MWh    $36.22    $40.53    $67.61    $73.44    $41.72    $36.81

The forward curve for power shows a rapid decline from peak levels achieved in
2000 and 2001E.  Rapid growth in construction of new generating capacity is the
primary cause of the decline in forward price expectations (with the slowing
economy an additional factor in the near-term).  See Figure 2.  Additionally,
we cite two reasons why plant builds tend to over-shoot (either on the upside
or the downside) changes in the demand for power.  These are because
electricity is capital intensive and a commodity, each of which creates cycles
of over- and under-development.

(1) Incremental Capacity Exceeds Incremental Demand.  The cause of
the current decline in prices is the rapid addition of new generating capacity,
in all regions of the country.  Additions to capacity are exceeding increases
in demand for power, by a wide margin, in most regions.  This has caused the
supply and demand balance to shift from a shortage to a growing surplus.
Additional factors have hastened the decline in prices.  A slowing economy has
reduced demand, as has the absence of last year's hotter-than-normal weather.
So far this summer, weather has been approximately normal.

(2) Capacity additions exceeded incremental demand in 2000.  We
think 2000 was the first year when incremental capacity exceeded incremental
demand.  We still have an underlying power shortage, which has lasted well into
2001.  However, the market is adding capacity in a manner which should
relentlessly lessen its severity and even potentially create over-capacity
within the next several years. In 2000, 27,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity was
added, up from 11,000 in 1999, and less than 10,000 MW during most of the
1990's.  We expect approximately 45,000 MW of capacity will be added in 2001,
and a similar number in 2002.  Since this amount exceeds the amount required to
meet growth in demand, we project a rising "reserve margin."  The reserve
margin is the best fundamental indicator of the balance between supply and
demand, with a high reserve margin indicating over-capacity (falling power
prices), and a low reserve margin indicating under-capacity (rising power
prices).  We tentatively project a bottoming of the electricity commodity price
cycle in 2003, if enough developers scale back their plans to build new plants.

TWO REASONS FOR BOOM AND BUST CYCLES IN POWER

(1) Electricity is a cyclical commodity industry.  We have reached the peak
of the "first-ever" cycle in the history of the industry.  We put "first" in
quotes because we think the cycles were always there, except they were hidden
by regulation.  With deregulation of the wholesale power market in 1996,
market-clearing prices reveal the balance between supply and demand.  From 1996
until mid 2001, we were climbing the mountaintop of the electricity cycle.  Now
we are on the downside.

(2) Electricity production is capital-intensive.  We think the cycles will last
a number of years, 4-6 years in the current cycle (we put the first year as
1998, when enough liquidity existed in the newly deregulated market; we see the
bottom as 2003), driven by the capital-intensive nature of the industry.  Power
plants take a long time to build.  Planning decisions must be made between 1
and 5 years in advance of the actual day when power will be produced.  This is
a much slower process than the market, and pricing expectations at the time of
planning will have no doubt changed by the time plants are up-and-running.  We
think it is difficult for individual company executives to fully anticipate the
development plans of their competitors and, in the quest for market share, the
tendency is to build in a manner which is often too aggressive when viewed on
an industry-wide basis years later.

GUIDE TO INVESTORS:  INDUSTRY-LEVEL

TRACK THE SPARK SPREAD.   A primary metric for investors to track is the
"spark spread".  The spark spread measures the difference between power prices
(revenues) and natural gas prices (cost).  This is the critical metric for
tracking earnings power of generating companies.  The gross margin of Power
Producers in the spot market will be determined by the spark spread, and when
these companies hedge, they will have to hedge using the forward spark spread
available at that time.  Thus, a declining spark spread affects the earnings
power of all companies, even those who are well hedged.  Only if they could
hedge 100% would their earnings be unaffected by declining prices.  No company
we are aware of has been able to hedge 100% of their output.

The forward spark spread actually suggests a worse commodity price environment
in the 2002/3 period than existed in 1998/9, prior to the run-up in prices in
2000/1.

STOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM

The following factors will help companies weather the storm, from most to least
importance:

Trading and risk management skills.  A strong trading desk acts as the "eyes
and ears" to the market, often providing advance warning of changes in the
commodity price outlook.  Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a
strong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their
competitors.  The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits
from trading and risk management activities, own little if any generating
capacity, and are characterized by a commodity price-neutral earnings model.
All of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help
their overall activity.  Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron
(ENE-1H).  We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price
environment.  Other companies with strong trading/risk management operations
include Dynegy (DYN-1H) and Aquila (ILA-1H).  Duke Energy (DUK-1H) and Mirant
(MIR-1H) also have strong operations.  In terms of vulnerability to power
prices, we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions, owing to the lack or
near-lack of generating capacity owned.

Contracting/hedging activity.  The more aggressive a company's moves were to
lock in power prices earlier this year, the better positioned they are.
Nevertheless, the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on
earnings, particularly in the long-run.  We note that Calpine (CPN-2H), which
we have downgraded to 2H from 1H, has aggressively stepped up its hedging
activity in recent weeks, signing a 3,000 MW deal with Shell, a 1,000 MW deal
with Reliant Resources (RRI-NR).  This activity appears to coincide with the
rapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months.

Offsetting "short" positions.  This is a characteristic typical of electric
utilities, who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the
short obligation to sell power to their customers.  Utilities that are well-
positioned in this regard include:  EXC and AEP.  Utilities that are most
vulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an
effort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play
Power Producers.  These include:  AYE, CEG, and PPL.  We are particularly
concerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity, or,
separately, relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars
to upgrade.  These plants are often the "marginal" unit, providing earnings in
tight pricing environments, but having significantly less value as prices
decline.

Backlog of plant development.  We also think that companies with significant
plant development backlogs can "muscle" their way through a weakened commodity
price environment.  In particular, we note CPN, whose plants in operation grow
as follows:

Figure 4. Calpine Earnings Metrics, 2000-2003E

                         2000     2001     2002     2003       CAGR
Y/E MW in operation     5,883   11,705   21,266   30,463        73%
% of portfolio hedged             85%      71%      61%
EPS                     $1.11    $1.95    $2.30    $3.00        39%

They have hedged aggressively their output from their plants, so even though
future plants have lower margins, overall EPS growth can still be impressive.
Nevertheless, we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN, reflecting the
impact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output.  Our revised
"Outperform" rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth
over the 2000-2003 period.

SUMMARY OF RATINGS/ESTIMATES/PRICE TARGET CHANGES

REVISED VALUATION TABLE

RISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE

We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance.

Some horses are already out of the barn.  Power Producers and selected
Energy Merchants (those with exposure to power prices) are down 26% since
peaking on May 1.  Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now
reflected in the stocks.  However, we do not think all of the horses are out of
the barn, and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at
this time.  The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS
estimates.  We think this is likely, particularly for 2002 and 2003, if power
prices continue their decline.  We think when this happens, stocks are likely
to go down further.

Hotter Weather.  So far in 2001, weather across the country has been near-
normal vs. hotter-than-normal weather last year.  The year-on-year moderation
has affected the forward curve.  Should August become hotter relative to last
year, the forward curve could temporarily strengthen, boosting power price and
earnings expectations near-term.  Ultimately, we think the principal cause of
the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants.  Even if the
curve temporarily strengthens due to weather, we still expect it will be
downward sloping for the next several years.

A Rebound in the Economy.  A weak economy has certainly affected power
demand, which, in turn, has affected the forward curve.  When the economy
eventually rebounds, which some are predicting by 4Q:01 or early 2002, the
forward curve should strengthen.  We will watch for these signs and adjust our
outlook accordingly.

Cancellations of plant development plans.  This factor is a wildcard for the
group in our opinion.  We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to
cancel plant development plans.  So far, sources such as turbine manufacturer
GE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled.  If/when
they occur, the cancellation of development plans will have two effects.
First, it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment, and
would likely be perceived as negative.  Then, following the cancellation of
enough development plans, it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power
prices in the future.  This is why we think power prices will bottom in 2003.
The mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will, in part, be driven by
cancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter
supply-demand balance.

SUMMARY:  BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP.

We are lowering ratings, price targets and/or estimates on 11 companies with
exposure to the declining trend in power prices.  We advise investors to be
more cautious on the group.  However, we continue to advise a shift toward
Energy Merchants, who have little or no commodity price exposure, and away from
Power Producers, who are long power, as well as those Integrated Utilities who
are long power.  Additionally, we see several factors that also merit a
cautious outlook, apart from the declining trend in power prices and its
adverse effect on earnings:

(1) Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market
begins to recover and/or tech stocks begin to outperform.

(2) Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a
time when many other S&P 500 sectors have "rolled over."  The resumption of
earnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away
from our Growth Energy names, particularly if their earnings is now under
challenge.

Ann,

I shall be glad to help you in any way I can. Please, give me a call
(713 853 3848) to set up a meeting.

I shall ask Shirley to distribute your message to the entire group
and ask for the volunteers who will be interested in discussing
their experience with you.

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to "people" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)

Please find attached a draft of the Technical Corner article.  I wanted to include the equation forms for Faraday's Law and Ampere's Law, but the equation tools are not installed on my machines.  If you like, I can try to get the added Monday morning after IT can install the equation tools.
 
Thanks,

Kate,

Thanks for your message. With all the turbulence going on in Enron
it's difficult for anybody to leave the office for an extended period of time.
We shall have to abstain this time and hope to join you in the future.
Vince

Dear Vince and Vasant :

Since you both won't be able to come for our Advisory Committee meeting on
Dec 7, can you send someone else to come? Please let me know, it is critical for us to have
someone from your team to come!!   As you can see from the attached RSVP list,
we have a quite good mix of people to come. FYI, I am attaching an agenda and
"possible issues" for your review.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Kate

Alex,

It probably makes sense to wait a few months to see if you really like Dynegy.
We can meet for lunch anyway sometimes in the next few weeks. Please, call me at

Hello Vince:

  We had spoken over the phone in late May, and setup an appointment to see
each other on 24 July 2001.  A few days later Yannis Tzamouranis called me
from Dynegy, and Dynegy moved very quickly to hire me.  I have a wife and a
kid, and I was a $25K/annum post-doc.  I simply couldn't wait.  From lunch
on 25 May, I was essentially hired by Yannis on 3 July.
  Yesterday I attended an INFORMS meeting with a presentor from Enron:
Chonawee Supatgiat, Research Group, Enron Corp.  I enjoyed his talk.  I am
enjoying Dynegy, but I'm learning that the possibilities of doing research
will be limited for a while to come, the weather group being so new to
Dynegy.  Ultimately, I'm interested in working both in the research and in
the business side.  Regarding looking for research work, I am now literally
in a much better position to consider my options - including Enron.

Alex

Hi Kelly,

here is an updated version of the KMV writeup with some general positives as well.  I eliminated the last section on Enron, and changed some wording.  I did not think you wanted to explictly give Enron's EDF on the website.  Let me know if you want to add it back, and if you have any other suggestions.  I will continue to review how else we can change/extend the writeup.

Thanks,

This is the list of the groups  that have access to Research directory.
Martin compiled this list.

Please, review it and let's talk about the recommendations regarding
changes and restrictions we have to make.

Please find attached an Excel workbook listing different access groups for Research.  I have marked some users for keeping and deleting.  I'm not sure how you wish to proceed.  You can edit the list as you see fit.  Perhaps we can contact those who have particular groups (e.g. Weather) for updates on their list.

I am generally of the opinion that the lists should be as short as possible.  A directory that Lance and I share with the power group was deleted yesterday but nobody knows who did that.  I hope after this audit is done, we are much less at risk of something that like happening again.

Thanks,
Martin

Subject:	No deal - Time to move !

All, 

After very serious consideration and having the experience of the first quarter,  I have decided the following:

1) Personally, I am starting the building of the public model beginning of June. I will follow a different methodological approach than the rest of the team but we are going to have the same common target for the 15th of July deadline.

2) The first suite of models will be ready beginning of July.

3) During implementation, I will be reporting to Scott Salmon and I am prepared to accept feedback on modelling (technical issues) from the following people (strictly): Iris Mack, Steve Leppard, Jagjit Dhaliwal, Slava Danilov, Vasant Shanbhogue, Bryan Seyfried, Amitava Dhar, Vince J Kaminski (The order of the names is random).  

4) Scott Salmon will communicate with the traders to make sure that we meet their requirements.

5) The traders should have all the time they need to assess the performance of the models and provide their valuable feedback. 

6) Extension of the models will be a continuous process (More data, more models).

7) Personally, I consider it absolutely beneficial  if I work closely with Houston and London Research from now on, so we can make sure that we do not miss anything going forward. If necessary, I am prepared to come to Houston and discuss technical issues about models.

8) If I have any problems to proceed with the current plan, I am going to ask for rotation as soon as possible. If this is not possible, I am going to leave the company immediately.
 
9) For those who invited me in the past in private rooms and asked me to slow down, I have to tell them that if this happens again I am going to proceed with an official complaint.

I am really sorry if I am being a bit agressive here, but I am sure that this the last chance for many of us. 

That's for now -

Best Regards,

g.

Hi,

	Today I met with John Dowling - a Vice President  of the Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC) .  LPC may present another potential set of options for ECT's data and/or public and private firm models needs.

	More specifically, John stated that LPC offers the following products/services:
	
?	A US data base - archives date back to 1988.  This database has various fields describing default and nondefault loans, etc.
?	A public and private firm model (both) for an annual subscription rate of $75,000.  These models estimate PDs for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.
?	The firm is beginning to collect data in European countries.


	John will be sending us further details about the analytical techniques used to develop their public and private firm models.  In addition, he will send us information on the various fields used in their database.



Regards,
Iris

Hello, Vince
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you in London.  After our lunch I had interesting discussions with the research group and continental trading group.  How was the response on your lecture/speech?
 
You mentioned that you could send me an interesting book on derivatives.  I am really looking forward to dive into it.  If you have two copies we may have one for reference and one for in-depth study at home.
 
You also mentioned that Tom Halliburton or Pereira could give a hands-on course in SDDP.  As I said, I am very interested in such a course some time this year.
 
Thanks and regards,
 
Andr? Damslora

==================================================================
RiskNews Update - week ending 27/4/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is ?151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level.

Thank you.

Dear Vince:

	I have now spent 16 hours on the valuation project and wanted to touch
base with you to make sure that the basic approach makes sense and that you
think we are making an appropriate amount of progress.  My invoice is
attached.

	By the way, John Martin just mentioned that you have agreed to be our
luncheon speaker at the Texas Finance Festival.  I really appreciate your
help on this and would like to schedule some time next week to talk about
it in more detail.

	I look forward to hearing from you.

regards,

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Anita,

Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the stay.
I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and Amitava, based
on the business need.

One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.

Vince

Vince:

I am making reservations for Iris to leave for London on Monday, April 30, 2001.  Iris said you want her to stay 2 weeks and Vasant wants her to stay 1 week.  I can have her return on Friday, April 11, 2001 or Tuesday, May 15, 2001.   Her only request is that she return before May 17, 2001 when Professor Kulatilaka from Boston University is here.    When do you want her to return?  

Thanks.  Anita

Diane,

This is the headcount projection for 2002. I am slightly above my plan for 2001
that I am under performing now.

Sorry for the delay.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

Vince,

Sean tells me that the structured deal libraries, probably requires a more thorough hand-over....

...do we have that expertise still in the building?... can we extend someone here to make that happen?

regards

Steve

PS: I hope you and your wife can attend on Saturday 6pm?.... is there anything you both can't eat? (vegetarian etc...)

Angelika,

Sorry for a short notice but unexpected is part of the
corporate life. Zimin will cover both my presentation and
the workshop - he is a very good speaker and I am sure
he will do a better job that I could do.

Thanks for letting me know. We regret that Vince Kaminski will not be able
to make it, but I appreciate that there can always be unforeseen
circumstances like this. I assume that he will not be able to attend the
workshop, either - could you confirm this?

Thank you for providing a replacement - I am looking forward to meeting Mr
Lu in Paris. We will need his presentation tomorrow by 12, as the van will
leave at 1 to go to Paris.

Angelika:

Unfortunately, Vince Kaminski will not be able to attend the conference
in Paris next week due to unforseen circumstances here at Enron Houston.
He will be sending Dr. Zimin Lu, Director, Enron Research to replace
him.

I will be sending Zimin's presentation to our London Office and they
will get the copies to you sometime on Friday.  The Enron London Admin.
who is handling this for us is Karin Ahamer and her phone number is
44-207-783-4419.

Shirley,

Thank you for letting me know.

Would you send the copies from the US or from your London office (which
is
just across the road from ours)? If you could get them to copy the
presentation, that would be brilliant. If not, I think it is too
complicated
and too expensive for you to send them from the US. I would then try and
take care of the copying myself (but would prefer not to, as it the run
up
to the conference is fairly frantic as it is...).

Thank you for your help!

Kind Regards,

Angelika Staude

Good Afternoon Vince, 
 
The HR Associate & Analyst program received Jill Schoenemann's resume from Beth Perlman earlier this month.  
 
I spoke with Jill to discuss the program with her and conveyed to her that compared with other candidates, she would be suited more as an analyst.  Currently, we are only hiring at the Associate level.  I also told Jill that the HR Associate/Analyst program was not the only way to begin a career in HR with Enron.  Jill will be one of the first we consider when we are hiring at the Analyst level later this year.  
 
Thank you for your further recommendation of a great candidate.  I will let you know when we are seeking to hire more HR Analysts.  
 
Kind Regards,
 
Adrianne Engler
HR Analyst

Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:29 PM

Subject: Overview of Investor Conference Call


Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=

Dear all,

We have developed analytical soulutions for weather-triggered commodity options.
We have also programmed those formulas into user-friendly Excel functions.

The original request came from the weather derivatives structuring desk, but the
model can be used in other situations --- generically it is a double trigger option deal.

See the documentation for more details.

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

Steve,

Two things. 

1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but
want to make sure I did not miss any important point.

2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship,
how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly,
Houston? Please, let me know.

I want to thank you along with Dean Warga, Bob Casey, and Dr. Praveen Kumar
for an engaging and successful inaugural meeting of the Energy Committee.
From our perspective, we achieved the key input and decisions desired of you.
 We hope that you saw the meeting as worthwhile and that it met your needs as
well. Any feedback that you have for me would be most appreciated.

I want to highlight the key outcomes and ask for your quick response on any
concerns.  First, the name which received the greatest endorsement and
therefore our choice was the Global Energy Management Institute, which as an
accronym would shorten to GEMI.  As discussed, the full name would actually
be the University of Houston's Global Energy Management Institute at the
Bauer College of Business.  Obviously, most references would be the Global
Energy Management Institute or GEMI.

Second, there was very valuable input and support on the concept of a
"partnership" having four fee based levels ($100k, $50k, $25k, and $5k).  We
will work at a first draft proposal of value received for those four levels
and send to you next week.  As suggested, we will not have an entrance fee
and we will think about some discounts or offsets with perhaps a minimum
amount not offsetable. Another suggestion was to call the levels something
which related to Energy.  We would offer up the Wood Level at $5k, the Coal
Level at $25K,  the Oil&Gas Level at $50k, and Nuclear at $100k.  Look for
your feedback here.

Attached is the outcome of the sub group selection.  We are thoroughly
delighted that your participation is very balanced which should strenghten
the overall results.  Hopefully next week we will be sending out separate
e-mails to the three sub groups seeking your detailed input.

I mentioned that we would like to schedule the next meeting of the Energy
Committee in January.  Please look at your calendars and let me know your
availability for the following dates:  Jan 10, Jan 15, Jan 23 and Jan 24.  We
will chose the one that the most members can attend.   As noted, the agenda
for that meeting for our discussion will be the sub group results plus an
important dialogue on Marketing (including alliances).

Again, thanks so much for your participation

Lane

Dear Dr. Whitaker,

I was contacted a few days ago by my friend, Richard McMinn, who is currently holding the Swiss Re Chair in the Management of Risk,  Centre for Risk and Insurance Studies, Nottingham University Business School. Before moving to England, he was for many years with the University of  Texas at Austin. He is also an editor of The Journal of Risk and Insurance.

Richard expressed interest in coming back to the States, and specifically to Texas. I remember from a number of conversations with you and other rmembers of your staff, that you are thinking about making several additions to the Faculty of Jones School, especially in the area of risk management. Richard is a well qualified candidate that you may consider in your search.

I am attaching the address of Richard's CV. Please, feel free to contact me if you need more information about his academic credentials.

Good Morning Vince,
 
I talked with Pravine Kumar this morning. He wants  me to e-mail my resume to him. Apparently they are trying to set up a trading  room that would be an educational process for eventually producing traders that  can step into energy trading firms. That is right up my alley.
 
I've had four stock positions move up more that 25%  over  the past two weeks. Do you still want trade ideas?

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

Vince, 
Attached here is the actual version of the slides I presented at INFORMS conference. Many people, including an area editor of Operations Research journal, showed their interests so I am thinking about publishing a paper about it. Of course, I will show it to you first before sending it to outside. 
I also met a guy from Bell Lab working in Lucent's Bandwidth trading group. He said that Lucent allocates about 3-4 researchers to work in this area. He said Lucent believes that the bandwidth demand will eventually pick up so they want to be the first one who provide products and research for supporting bandwidth trading. I agree with him that research work should not be stopped and bandwidth trading will become a reality in the next few years.
This time the conference is very big. They have 45 parallel sessions presenting at the same time for 3.5 days.

Sorry to hear you cannot make it ... you would obviously have been the big

In terms of a London based replacement, who did you have in mind and what

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Billy,

Your recommendation makes sense. It's a new program and we have no data points
about its quality.

I shall inform my contact that you have already fully committed your resources
and cannot make  anymore campus trips. I shall offer to collect the resumes and distribute 
them within Enron.

Vince,

Thanks for the note and suggestion on the campus presentation.  I'll defer to you and Traci on this.  

My opinion is that I would not invest the business time and hard dollars on it, unless you see this program as a good "feeder" for your area.  My recommended path would be for you to do the speech, collect resumes, and pass out business cards.  We can then use our "direct" approach with this school, and peruse the resume book to see if there is anyone that looks like a match with our needs.  The next step would be to try to bring in some fulltime or even intern candidates and see how they perform.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss.

Thanks,
Billy

P.S.  I really appreciate you attending the dinner Wednesday night at Enron Field.

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, I am attaching below the URL for
our QCF program here at Georgia Tech for your corporate recruiting folks.
http://www.qcf.gatech.edu/
It will be great if we could have your recruiting people meet with our
first graduating class of the QCF program.

Regarding your visit, we'd be glad to cover the coach airfare and
lodging.  How about the first week of October, say on either 10/2 or 10/4,
or the last week of October, say 10/30?  The arrangement would be that you
come in on the evening of a Monday or a Wednesday and give a seminar on a
Tuesday or a Thursday.  Please let me know what works best for
you.  Thanks.

Subject:	Energy Committee Minutes from January 23rd

Energy Committee Members

The following members were in attendance at the January 23rd meeting: Bruce
Williamson, Tina Sivinski, Tim Tipton, Bruce Sukaly, Bob Peebler, Vince
Kaminski, Dean Arthur Warga, Praveen Kumar, and Lane Sloan.  The handout
material is attached for members that could not attend.

The committee viewed a TV ad  for the Bauer College and a TV news story on
the new AIM center and  Cougar Fund.  The first item of business was the
Partnership program.  The committee agreed on the following levels:

             Trustee            $100,000
             Partner                50,000
             Investor               25,000
             Sponsor              10, 000

For this year,  these levels would receive placements in the new Energy
Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows:
Trustee up to 10, Partner up to 4, Investor up to 2, and Sponsor 0.   All
members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the
Learning Community programs of seminars, forums, and symposiums free of
charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying
depending upon the partnership level.  The Chairman noted that with the
certificate classes beginning in September, then the annual fee structure
would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part
of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI.  The original idea had
been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these
costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach.  The
Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing
efforts originally targeted at $200,000 for this year.

Dr. Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as 1)
Risk Management 2) International Project Finance, and 3) Energy Accounting.
The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy
Accounting to start programs in September (many already available).  The
International Project Finance may require additional time because of
development efforts on certain courses.  Dr. Kumar requested that the members
identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on
the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy
community.  We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on
what level of participation your forsee for your company.  Dr. Kumar noted
that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course
development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses
until junior and senior years.  He said that specialized training programs
seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated.

The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars, forums and conferences.
There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not
recommend pursuing conferences at this time.  The plan would be to have in
steady state 3 seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a
featured speaker.  It was noted that the venue would be an important
consideration to attract appropriate audiences.  Various suggestions were
given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations
should be practical and of high quality. The committee agreed that a
reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program.
The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused
groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter.  The thought
was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service
sector considerations. Non members would not participate but selected student
participation was seen as valuable.

A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various
committee members.  The idea of a symposium was to bring together important
spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the
Energy community. The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to
address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts.  Dr.
Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around
current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and
credit risk considerations.  The committee was quite enthused that an
imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought
out as to topic and the management of the process including the media.  It
was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then
it would need to provide a project manager.  Committee member companies would
need to provide assistance/advice particularly on coordinating the media.
Dr. Kumar will be sending out an e-mail to get your input.  Then Dean Warga
would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which
could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks.

Next, Dr. Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key
issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place.
 The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with
other aspects of GEMI, the AIMs investment center, etc.

The Chairman then discussed GEMI's overall marketing image.  There was some
fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key
aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image
contained in the attachment.  After the dialogue on the symposium, which
would be a major marketing effort in an of itself, the discussion on external
and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting.  The chairman noted that
there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium
effort was pursued.  The major focus initially being on the symposium then
coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing
over the next several months.

The last item was the competitive assessment/relationship with other
universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current
approach and principles in the attachment.  This received good support from
the committee.

The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks.  I
will send out a separate e-mail on possible dates for you to consider.

Best Regards,
Lane

Vince,

Happy New Year.  Would you mind if I used you as a recommender for a job I am
currently chasing at Cisco Systems, Inc.?  I have been talking to them about
an Assistant Treasurer job.  The opportunity came through an executive search
firm, Heidrick & Struggles, and they would like to visit with some people in
regard to my background, deal skills, origination skills and integrity.
Thank you very much.  I hope all is well and I look forward to catching up
soon.

Kind regards,

I was wondering if Vince was still on the lecture circuit.  I recently gave

not actively recruiting, it would give him a chance to look the program

We discussed United Way last Thursday when you were on the 32nd floor
monitoring the hurricane.

Y'all,

I think we didn't get the word on this somehow!

In a lot of ways, percent participation is just as or even more important than magnitude.

Please check out the hyperlink below in Vince's email to me so we can show research solidarity!.

Thanks.

Please, try to mobilize the members of the group
who have not made a contribution yet. Research is shown
as a separate group in all the reports and we may stand out as unit
at the end of this week.

As of this morning, EWS Research has $19,355 in pledges from 13 out of 47 employees.  The final 34, who have not accessed the system, are:

	Stephen Bennett		Rakesh Bharati
	Shirley Crenshaw		Lance Cunningham
	Chuanli Deng			Amitava Dhar
	Anita Dupont			Youyi Feng
	Shane Green			Anguel Grigorov
	Thomas Halliburton		Paulo Issler
	Seksan Kiatsupaibul		Sandeep Kohli
	Jaesoo Lew			Martin Lin
	Zimin Lu			Jose Marquez
	Praveen Mellacheruvu		Kevin Moore
	Mitra Mujica			Wichai Narongwanich
	Christopher Pernoud		Maureen Raymond
	Michael Roberts			Osman Sezgen
	Wiliam Smith			Adam Stevens
	Sofya Tamarchenko		Leann Walton
	Sarah Wooddy			Sevil Yaman
	Roman Zadorozhny		Oren Zimmerman

In order to access the system, all they need to do is click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/.  They will need their GIS ID and password.  If they don't know what their ID and password are, have them go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the "Accept" button, and then click on "Forgot your User ID or Password?"

Keep in mind that they are counted as having participated whether they contribute or not, as long as they access the system and indicate their preference.  However, I would encourage them to contribute something.

Thanks.

Eric

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

I know that I have not touched a lot of details.  But I am hoping to just paint a big picture on the possible impact of the Raptor structures.

Michelle,

The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker,
5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.

I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level
of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable
time.

Hi,

	As per your request, here is a very rough draft of the document you requested.  It is far from being complete.

	Hopefully while in London I will have time to work on it some more.

	Your comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

It's interesting MS wants to be only on one side of the transaction.
I think it reflects their ability to hedge. Any other thoughts?

Jeff/Vince,

One of our potential customers provided us with MS's daily price sheet from earlier this week.  Interesting to see the JCC offers that have been provided.  Some of the WTI offers look fairly rich as well, particularly the 10 yr price.  MS also requires fairly hefty cash collateral requirements.

Thought this might be of interest in determing how competitive we could be with JCC.

Latha

Thanks for asking!

I'd like to leave San Francisco
non-stop to Houston on United
1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm,
then go to Austin on the late
afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT),
then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco
on the evening of the 11th.
(There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver
that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm,
connecting to United 409 out of Denver).
If there is a non-stop from Austin to
San Francisco or San Jose, that is even
better. (United, my preferred, does
not have a non-stop from Austin to
the Bay Area.)

The cost will be shared 50-50 with U. Texas,
if that's OK with you and them. I have copied
the organizer of the seminar there,
Professor Ron Kaniel.

Warm regards,

Darrell

Todd,

Thanks for the opportunity to speak at the conference.
It was a great pleasure to see you again.

Zimin Lu briefed me about Tuesday and Wednesday and told
me the presentations were very interesting.

Vince --

Thanks again for participating in Monday's preconference workshop on
Volatility. Your remarks on modeling volatility and option valuation were
most appreciated by the attendees and me.

I am sorry you weren't able to make the storage conference on Tuesday and
Wednesday. It was a very engaging discussion of valuation issues, from many
different perspectives.

Best wishes in your business activities during these volatile times.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Hi Vincent:
 
Super Saturday is coming and I am so happy to move toward the end of the recruiting process.  During the interviews that I have had so far, I expressed my desire to have my first rotation in your group.  Last spring I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I met.  I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.

Subject:=09Days of Caring - Details of Cleaning Project

Gentlemen/Ladies,

I've been asked by Julie Clyatt to help coordinate the volunteer assignment=
s and materials for the cleaning projects at the Center for the Retarded on=
 August 10th. =20

Project Assignments
There are actually three cleaning projects - all require volunteers in the =
morning and/or afternoon.  The details of the projects are below:

Project 268 - Clean glass throughout solarium and shade house.
Project 275 - Clean all interior windows on floors 2 through 6 (70-80 windo=
ws in common areas) in Cullen Residence Hall.
Project 279 - Clean ground floor windows (109 inside and 165 outside) in Cu=
llen Residence Hall.

When you get to the site there will be an orientation in the auditorium for=
 all volunteers at the the Center.  Everyone will then disperse to their di=
fferent projects.  There are not enough total volunteers for to cover all o=
f the cleaning projects listed above so just choose which one you'd like to=
 do and you'll be directed to that area.

Materials Required by Volunteers

The only materials required to be brought by the volunteers are boxes of La=
tex Gloves (1 box each project) and for Project 268,  two 100' heavy duty w=
ater hoses.  Can anyone bring these?

Logistics

You probably already have this but just a reminder....

Transportation: Shuttles will be provided to take you to and from the site.=
  Loading and unloading of buses will be on Shaw Street, between the Antioc=
h Church and 3 Allen parking lot.  Morning shifts will leave at 8:15am and =
return to Enron at 11:30am.  Afternoon shifts will leave at 1:00 and return=
 at 4:00pm.

Food:  The volunteer appreciation lunch will be from 11:00am - 1:00pm via t=
he Big E Cafe.  Lunches will be provided by Chick-Fil-A. =20

Water:   Water and ice will be provided at the Enron building before the bu=
ses leave.  Please bring coolers from home to load the water. =20

T-Shirts:  T-shirts can be picked up at EB 1624.  T-shirts will also be ava=
ilable while loading the buses.


Thanks,
Marilyn

Rick,

Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak
at this conference? Our friends at UT were very disappointed last
time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should
try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

Subject:	Research Group Teamwork

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to "people" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)

There is an error in the Options based spreadsheet as I forgot to net the public and private assets.  Paulo has access to the modified spreadsheet.  Also, Paulo is going to visit the issue of risky/riskfree compounding/discounting.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Hi Vince,

	Chitra wanted me to check with you to see if you (Enron Research) would be interested in sponsoring a table at the annual gala dinner with the Consul General, and the Indian Ambassador.  People associated with India projects (Sandeep, Krishna, etc) may benefit.  Of course, if you are sponsoring, I would like to be invited.  

	EBS is sponsoring one table, and that is the only Enron participation so far.

Jim,

Thanks for your patience.
Greg is quite busy right now.
I saw him this morning and  told
him that I would like to schedule
a separate meeting to discuss your proposal.
Hopefully, this will happen later this week.

I am forwarding your request to Jay Webb
who is in charge of the EOL system.

I shall let you know as soon as I can
if we can give you a visitor account.

Today's focus: Red Hat no longer sings "When I'm 64"

By Phil Hochmuth

Linux distributor Red Hat last week made two announcements that
should make proponents of 64-bit Linux servers happy: it
released Red Hat Linux 7.2 for both the Intel Itanium and
Compaq Alpha processors.

Although Red Hat was previously able to run on Alpha and
Itanium platforms, the software did not take full advantage of
their 64-bit processing power. But version 7.2 for 64-bit
computing includes the newest Linux kernel (2.4.9), with
features such as higher symmetrical multiprocessing scaling and
ext3 journaling file system.

The support for these features, Red Hat says, will allow the
operating system to take better advantage of the Alpha and
Itanium platforms, which can process much larger file sizes and
handle larger address spacing than 32-bit systems.

Red Hat Linux 7.2 includes other enhancements such as improved
USB support, network configuration and user management
applications, plus a firewall configuration program that can be
configured during server setup.

Itanium is the latest iteration of Intel's PC processor, and is
catching on with users who run high-end Web servers and
enterprise-level application. Prior to Itanium, the Alpha was
the big dog among the 64-bit processor platforms. Although
Compaq has said it will phase out its 64-bit Reduced
Instruction Set Computing processor over the next few years,
Alpha systems are still used widely in database and Web
transactions servers in industries such as finance, medical,
and supercomputing research.

Dear Dr. Kaminski--
Chonawee Supatgiat has applied for a tenure-track faculty position in Decision
Sciences at the Fuqua School of Business, and he has listed you as a reference.
Do you have a letter of recommendation for him (ideally in electronic form)
and/or can you tell me anything about his research and teaching potential?
Thanks in advance for your help, and best wishes for the New Year.
                  Sincerely,

Sorry it took me so long to email this to you.  My computer locked up and I had to get the Resolution Center to fix it.  

Rakesh is staying at the Toronto Hilton - 1-416-869-3456; Sherri is with him and her cell phone number is 832-725-5529

I do not have any numbers for the conference itself.  Let me know if you need anything else.

It has been a sad ending to a phenomenal period at Enron. The one thing that no one can take from us is the experince we gained and the relationships we've made.

I spoke with Bill Finnoff at Prediction Company this morning.  I mentioned
to
Bill your  position at Enron and the high-quality quant group that you
manage
there.  I told Bill that I had recently had a conversation with you in
which
you expressed interest in speaking to someone at Prediction Company about
their experience with computerized trading; and if possible, to arange for
some consulting.

Bill indicated to me that he probably would not be able to provide
consulting
services, but he is able to have discussions with colleagues in his field.
He said that he would be delighted to talk with you and provide you with as
much relevant information as he could within the Prediction Company
guidlines.

Bill's telephone number is: (505) 984-3123.  The office assistant will have
to connect you to his extension.

Bill's e-mail adddress is: finnoff@predict.com


Hope this helps.

Larry

P.S.  I have had several conversations with two of the Prediction board
members over the past couple of months.  If this connection would help you,
please let me know, and I'll see what I could arrange.  But, for the
details
of the way things really work, Bill should be an excellent initial contact.

P.S.S.  I thought that I had transmitted this to you this morning, Vince,
but
my e-mail system reported a delivery problem tonight.  So I'll try this
again
now.

P.S.S.  This is the second day that I've not been able to send this e-mail
to you.  I just spoke with Shirley.  She indicated that you are migrating
your e-mail to Outlook, so I should try again.

We're ready to go.   I have set up the reception from 5:00 - 6:00  September 10th. It will be held at the Hall of Honors (in the CBA) and the Energy Finance Group will also be invited.  After the reception, I think it would be wisest to have Billy and Vince join the corporate presentation, which is scheduled from 6:00 - 9:00pm.  The summer interns receiving full-time offers will be invited to attend.  That way, they can share their summer experiences with the audience.
 
I think Professor Ronn's itinerary is great!
 
Please let me know if you have any additions or corrections to the plan.
 
Thanks!

Professor Ronn, Billy and Lexi:

September 10th works great for Vince.  He suggests the following if it works for your schedules:

1.  Lunch on the 10th with Professor Ronn and colleagues (to be coordinated by Professor Ronn)
2.  Vince's presentation to MBA students:  2:00 - 5:00 PM
3.  Associate/Analyst Reception:  5:00 - 7:00 (?) (to be coordinated by the Associate/Analyst Program)
4.  Dinner with the Associate Analyst group:   7:30 PM or whenever the reception is over. (to be coordinated by the Associate/Analyst Program)
 
Please let me know if this is workable with everyone or if you have other suggestions.
 
Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Greetings.  Not to worry:  I like heat and thaw out in the '90's.

Sep. 10th is indeed feasible.

I scheduled the invitation dates of 9/24 - 10/17 to give me time to make
progress in my class presentations so that students would have more of a
background in listening to Vince's presentation.  If select the 9/10 date,
I would ask Vince to take into account in the level of his presentation
that by that date the students will only have had 6 hrs. of the Foundations
of Energy Finance class (classes begin 8/29 and Labor Day intervenes).  On
the plus side, the students do come in with three finance courses (core
course, investments, advanced corporate) as prerequisites to my class.

In sum, I appreciate the importance of recruiting and can accommodate
Vince's presentation Sep. 10th.  Please advise if Vince would like the 2
1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or the 75-min. subset
thereof.

>Perhaps we could arrange lunch or dinner the day of the presentation
>for yourself and our 5 summer associate interns.  That way, we are
>making the most of your time in Austin.
I had planned on hosting Vince for lunch with my faculty colleagues.  If
his presence is called for at a lunch scheduled by your Associate/Analyst
Program, we will plan his schedule around that.  By this e-mail I also
inquire of Lexi whether Enron intends to host a reception at the 5 p.m. end
of the class:  If so, she should contact Energy Finance Center Assist.
Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (or 512-232-7386) to
coordinate matters.

Sincerely,
Ehud Ronn

Vince,

Thanx for the quick response.  

I really want to provide Jose the opportunity to be heard and discuss theory more than specific details.  A lunch or breakfast informal meeting would suffice.  

If your Karma continues to work, we may start strategically place you on 32 for AGA days or I may keep you for customer negotiations in 4th quarter.

Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce

Jay,

I have to add another item to a long list of your headaches.

Greg Whalley gave us marching orders to treat the development of quantitative
models for data mining of EOL trade records as the top priority.
I shall be providing Greg bi-weekly updates on the project. 

FYI only. I am flying with Greg next week to a meeting with a third party
that may be involved in some aspects of this project. I shall tell you more when
we meet.

I know that we, as well as Greg, can count on full support and cooperation from you.

I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, to set up a meeting with you next week after I come back from
the trip.

Natural Gas Futures Continue Lower=20

Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower yesterday as traders remaine=
d in a bearish mood following Wednesday's triple digit AGA report. The July=
 contract lost $0.074 to $4.038 per MMBtu, trading most of the session abov=
e the $4.00 support level as warm weather in the Northeast kept demand firm=
. August dipped $0.088 to $4.123 per MMBtu. Local and short-term traders' e=
arly efforts to push prices lower were successful, but some see the risk/re=
ward of additional selling at these levels limited. On Wednesday, the AGA r=
eported a storage inventory build of 105 Bcf from the previous week, well a=
bove both the 2000 injection of 78 Bcf and the 5-year average of 81 Bcf for=
 the comparable weeks. The selling sparked by the AGA number was encouraged=
 by some disappointment with weather conditions in the Northeast. Earlier t=
his week, some forecasters were calling for warmer temperatures, with some =
cities expected to be near 90 degrees. But temperatures in the region have =
been in the low to mid-80s. However, warmer weather is expected to continue=
 in the East though this weekend. Mild weather will linger in the north-cen=
tral and northwestern states. California and the western states will begin =
to heat up this weekend and early next week. Further tests of $4.00 are lik=
ely, with significant support at $3.80. Resistance is seen at $4.20. Natura=
l gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.=
15  $0.25 yesterday, except out west, where the Topock delivery point tumbl=
ed over $1.00. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $=
0.16 to $3.97 per MMBtu.

Nova Scotia Wants Royalty Revenue

Nova Scotia wants a bigger share of the cash generated by its oil and natur=
al gas reserves to fund the regulators needed to monitor the growing indust=
ry, according to the provinces Premier. Speaking at an energy conference in=
 Halifax, he pleaded with the federal government to let the province keep m=
ore of the royalties. A 1986 offshore deal between Canada and Nova Scotia n=
ames the province as the main beneficiary of offshore oil and natural gas r=
oyalties, but the actual revenue split gives Ottawa 81% and Nova Scotia 19%=
. Nova Scotia already exports natural gas to New England from the Sable Off=
shore Energy Project. A possible second pipeline proposal to the Northeast =
US is being studied.=20

California Expects More Power Price Regulation

California lawmakers expect the FERC to strengthen its existing plan to lim=
it power prices during emergencies by expanding the plan to the entire West=
 for all hours of the day. The plan would fall short of the price caps. But=
, expanding the existing formula for price limits has picked up support amo=
ng Republicans who are under increasing pressure. FERC Chairman Hebert has =
called a special commission hearing for Monday to address the continuing is=
sues affecting California and the West. The proposal seeks to have FERC set=
 target prices for wholesale electricity prices on an around-the-clock basi=
s for the entire West. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are t=
riggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amo=
unt that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plan=
t. Hebert says that since the FERC relief plan went into effect on May 29th=
, power prices in California have dropped to under $100 per MWh from earlie=
r in May over the $300 per MWh. The day-ahead market in California recently=
 traded about $45 per MWh.=20

Williams to Supply California Ethanol

Williams Bio-Energy has agreed to supply ethanol to California by the fourt=
h quarter of this year. Earlier this week, the EPA denied California's requ=
est to waive provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act requiring the use of addi=
tives to make cleaner-burning gasoline. The decision means California will =
need about 580 million gallons of ethanol for RFG oxygenates in 2004, becau=
se the state banned MTBE by the end of 2002. Williams will house 15,000 bar=
rels of ethanol at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners storage facility in Carson=
, California, to supply the Los Angeles and San Diego markets. Williams pla=
ns transport ethanol to the storage facility and directly to refiners by la=
rge unit rail shipments and ocean vessels. =20

Natural Gas Investments in Mexico at Risk of Drying Up=20

Mexico has made changes to its natural gas price formulas, but they have pr=
oved insufficient to appease distributors, and Metrogas, Tractebel and Semp=
ra are threatening to halt investment in new projects. A more efficient and=
 more competitive regulatory standard is required. The Mexican regulatory c=
ommission for energy, the CRE has not changed the reference for prices whic=
h remains southern Texas. The federal commission for regulatory improvement=
s has a week to decide whether to accept the CRE's proposals. Mexico will r=
equire private sector investment of $114 Billion by 2009 in the sector. The=
 companies want to see a new standard established before the end of the yea=

House Appropriations Committee Rejects Power Price Caps

Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have rejected a push by D=
emocrats to cap West Coast power prices, but Democrats said they will keep =
pressing the issue. The panel voted along party lines to defeat a bill to f=
orce FERC to cap wholesale electricity prices in the West. Democrats tried =
to stick the measure in a $6.5 billion spending bill that was intended main=
ly to fill out immediate defense needs this fiscal year. Rejecting the pric=
e caps amendment, Republicans argued it would not solve California's proble=
ms of tight supplies, but would further distort the marketplace. House Repu=
blican Whip DeLay of Texas said California's power crisis is the result of =
allowing environmental extremists to run the state government. Saying the f=
ederal government should not intervene in California's electricity market, =
Rep. Callahan of Alabama, who chairs the House Appropriations Energy and Wa=
ter subcommittee, said: I respectfully submit to you that you've made your =
own bed. Democrats countered that limiting prices to cover production costs=
 and a reasonable profit was essential to halt price gouging by unscrupulou=
s suppliers. Democrats hoped to persuade a few West Coast Republicans to su=
pport the price caps, but those on the committee resisted. Under the existi=
ng plan, the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a powe=
r emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produ=
ce power at the least efficient plant. Generators can charge more if it can=
 be justified.=20

Dominion Plans WV Coal Fired Plant=20

Dominion and Anker Energy have plans to develop with a $600 Million, 450 MW=
, coal and coal waste fired facility and mining complex in Upshur County, W=
V. Dominion would be responsible for the construction, ownership and operat=
ion of the proposed facility, which will utilize state-of-the-art clean coa=
l technology and would burn more than 65% coal waste. Anker would provide a=
ll of the facility's fuel from on-site surface mining operations. This prop=
osed coal-fired plant is the first Dominion has developed since payingt $1.=
2 billion to the EPA last November for Clean Air Act violations pertaining =
to its coal-fired facilities. The proposed facility will be developed with =
NOx reducing equipment built-in. Also, the plant will utilize circulating f=
luidized bed boilers, technology that allows coal to be burned more efficie=
ntly. The CFB boilers can also burn low heat-content coal and waste fuel, s=
omething traditional burners cannot. All coal and coal waste produced will =
be burned on-site. Limestone will be used to react with sulfur in the coal =
to lower SO2 emissions.=20

APGA Believes Market Manipulated=20

Unsatisfied by the federal government's explanation that the high gas price=
s last winter were due mainly to supply and demand, the American Public Gas=
 Association says it believes the recent price drop is a signal that the ma=
rket may have been unfairly manipulated. In a letter sent to the EIA and to=
 key lawmakers, APGA insists that the supply/demand explanations do not tel=
l the full story. Rather, the association of municipal gas systems believes=
 price speculation played a major role in the dramatic upswing in prices du=
ring the 2000-2001 heating season. Citing FERC's investigation into gas pri=
ces at the California border, APGA said it is concerned not only about that=
 point, but also that market power gained through the unregulated control o=
f pipeline capacity will lead to unjust and unreasonable prices for natural=
 gas service throughout the US. APGA says it is convinced that the true cau=
se of record prices for gas will not be known unless the role played by ene=
rgy traders and price speculators is examined.=20

Kevin,

Ed is running a consulting firm in Boston that often tries to act as a boutique merchant bank.
He inquired if Enron could provide transmission hedges for the Neptune project.

Any interest. Please, feel free to contact Ed directly and let me know.

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Ed

Dear Mr. Kaminski:
I assume that Prof. Oren has sent to you an e-mail in which he  informed of our ongoing purpose of organizing an international conference on Ten  year of Electricity Deregulation and Restructuring. He attached a very  preliminary agenda as well with all the people and lectures committed  already.
I would like to formally invite you to come to Spain by  December 17-18 to give a lecture of around 45 minutes on the key  issues that operators and energy services and trading companies are confronting  in assessing the risk chain in the new deregulated environment business:  adequacy risks, trading risk management, capacity markets, etc.
Regarding budget and expenses, I can allocate $2.500,  plus a bonus should we break even, to cover your traveling and emoluments.  We will take care of the lodging as well.
 
Please feel free to contact me if you need further details. As  soon as we have some more formal description of the Conference and a first  definitive schedule I will send it to you.
 
Let me have your response whenever you are able to do  so.
 
Best regards.

wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy

Subject: Price Dynamics and Risk Management in the Energy Markets

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com
We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your
presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM
conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider
making a presentation at Aspen's corporate world conference Aspen World 2002
in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of
Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a
little strange making a "cold-call" in this manner, but I am reaching out in
the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain,
Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers.
AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or
application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and
activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and
integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been
cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing
activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology.
Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one
intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and
staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling
technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and
opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest
convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you
think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on
the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTech's core businesses.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Sincerely,
Skip Paules

Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling

This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties
and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on
the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include:
point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization
application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as
well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting,
supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading
models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What
developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to
take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level
where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain
optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk
and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged
strategies to achieve the desired goals.

Possible presentation topics will include:

*	Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling
*	Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time)
*	Robust control
*	Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications
*	Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets)
*	Flexible design and synthesis
*	Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand
*	General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk,
Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty

Subject:	Market Forecasting Conference

Hi Vince,

It been awhile since we have spoken, hope all has been going great for
you.

I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to
invite you to speak at our conference.

Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am
attaching that to this email.

This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and
attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which
is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.

Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the
US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both
geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for
networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the
presentations are very well attended.

We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have
no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we
can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would
greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a
pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would
consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your
desires and with our program.

As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the
conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle
the travel and hotel.

We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered
reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which
overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information
about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun
golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are
interested.

We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward
to hearing from you.

Thanks

Warren

Traci:

I am forwarding you the resume of Marilyn Mielke. She is a very highly
educated and accomplished person. She has a background in science but 
no skills required in my group. I was impressed with her excellent
communication and social skills - maybe she can acquire
necessary skills going through the Analyst/Associate program.

She was knocking on the Enron's door for a long time.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you so very much for your time on Wednesday. It has been
challenging to find out, from the outside, exactly what your group does
on a daily basis and what type of people make up your team. I do not
feel that there is any substitute for the information, and feel, that
one can get directly from the source itself, thank you for making your
team available to meet with me as well.

You mentioned that the Associate Program at Enron could be a great
starting point for me to acquire the business skills and experience that
I seek. I would be a most enthusiastic candidate as I have looked into
the program, and I too, feel that it would be an exciting and logical
starting point for me.

It is my understanding that in order for me to enter the program I would
require sponsorship. Would you be able to sponsor me for this program?
If so, I have attached my cv (as a Word '97 document) and understand
that the person to be contacted with a nomination would be Mr Jeff Davis
in Human Resources. Please let me know if there is anything further that
I can do to realize my goal of working within Enron while gaining
business skills and experience.
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Thank you again for your help and encouragement.

Sincerely,
Dr. Marilyn Mielke

Summer is quickly drawing to a close for our summer interns.  

We have scheduled several departure dates for the interns.  Our records indicate that your summer intern, Russell W. Parks III, is scheduled to return to school on 8/9/01.  

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 2nd at 10:00 am to 11:30 am in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me at X33242.

Subject:	Finance Club: e-trading and Fixed Income Markets Workshop


As faculty advisor to the Finance Club, Prof. Barb Ostdeik is encouraging
all members to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about
trading operations from two very respected individuals in the industry.
Keith Anderson of BlackRock, Inc (JGSM 1983) and Dexter Senft of Lehman
Brothers & TradeWeb LLC (Rice 1974) have visited the Jones School to give
this lecture and students have raved about them. Albert Wang's Fixed Income
and Advanced Investments classes are required to attend, and James Weston
recommends for his Applied Finance students and any first years taking
Investments next year to be there.

When:
9:45 a.m. - 11:15 a.m.
Wednesday
April 18

Where:
Room 117
Herring Hall

Presentation/Discussion Topics:
Trading Tactics - phone trades vs. electronic trading
Evolution of e-trading in fixed income markets
The future of the trading desk
Buy-side vs. Sell-side issues

Speaker Profiles:

Keith Anderson, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income
of BlackRock, Inc., is co-head of the Fixed Income Operating Committee,
Chairman of the Investment Strategy Group and a member of BlackRock's
Management Committee.   Mr. Anderson is responsible for global fixed income
strategy, asset allocation and the overall management of client portfolios.
He coordinates a team of thirty-two portfolio managers and more than
twenty-five credit and quantitative analysts.

Mr. Anderson is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which
meets quarterly in Washington, D.C. with the Secretary and Staff of the U.S.
Treasury to advise them on the financing and management of the Federal debt.

Prior to founding BlackRock in 1988, Mr. Anderson was a Vice President in
Fixed Income Research at The First Boston Corporation, working in mortgage
securities and derivative products strategies.  Mr. Anderson with Criterion
Investment Management Company where he had primary responsibility for a $2.8
billion fixed income portfolio.

Mr. Anderson has authored numerous articles on fixed income strategies,
including two articles in The Handbook of Fixed Income Options: "Scenario
Analysis and the Use of Options in Total Return Portfolio Management" and
"Measuring, Interpreting, and Applying Volatility within the Fixed Income
Market".




Dexter Senft is a Managing Director with global responsibility for Fixed
Income electronic commerce for Lehman Brothers. During his eight years at
the firm, he has also managed or co-managed Lehman's Fixed Income Research,
Quantitative Research, Counterparty Credit and Global Economics departments.

Mr. Senft is the former Chairman of TradeWeb LLC, a consortium-owned
electronic bond trading system whose volume currently averages over $10
billion per day, and of which Lehman Brothers is a founding shareholder. He
remains on TradeWeb's Board, and chairs TradeWeb's trading protocol
committee, which oversees the rules that govern the electronic flow of
information within the system.

Mr. Senft also serves on the Bond Market Association's Committee for
Alternative Trading Systems, as well as its Online Bond Steering Committee
and he chairs the subcommittee on e-commerce protocols and standards.

Prior to EJV, Mr. Senft spent 17 years at The First Boston Corporation (now
part of CS First Boston), where he was a Managing Director and head of Fixed
Income Research and Product Development. He is a widely published author of
articles on mortgage securities, fixed income derivatives, and quantitative
portfolio management, and his work continues to be among the readings for
CFA applicants. In 1983, Mr. Senft led the product team that created the
first CMO for Freddie Mac.


This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session
arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may
have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get
the info out to more 2nd years as well.

Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty,
students, and staff?

Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to
come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance
elective to come.

These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.

Thanks.

   I am a student in both MS qcf and Ph.d EDA programs in Georgia Tech

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for the natural gas information. The electricity price
is also definitely of great help if it can be available.

Could you kindly please let me know the contact information for FT or
Megawatt Daily? I will contact them asap to get their permission for the
access of the price data.

Thank you very much and have a great day!

One day Father Boudreaux and Pastor Thibodeaux wus fishin on the side
of dey road. Dey thoughtfully made a sign saying:

                   "The End is Near, Cher' !
                    Turn yurself 'Round now,
                    before it's too late!,"

and showed it to each passing car.

Well dis one car dat passed didn't appreciate the sign and wus shouting
at dem and hollin "Leave us alone, you religious nuts!"

Den all of a sudden dey heard a big splash and dey looked at each other
and Fr. Boudreaux said .....
"ya think we shoulda just put a sign dat says  'Bridge Out' instead?"

Good Afternoon Vince, 
 
The HR Associate & Analyst program received Jill Schoenemann's resume from Beth Perlman earlier this month.  
 
I spoke with Jill to discuss the program with her and conveyed to her that compared with other candidates, she would be suited more as an analyst.  Currently, we are only hiring at the Associate level.  I also told Jill that the HR Associate/Analyst program was not the only way to begin a career in HR with Enron.  Jill will be one of the first we consider when we are hiring at the Analyst level later this year.  
 
Thank you for your further recommendation of a great candidate.  I will let you know when we are seeking to hire more HR Analysts.  
 
Kind Regards,
 
Adrianne Engler
HR Analyst

Lance,

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Vince

Subject:	RE: Potential Candidate, Summer Intern

Hi Lance,

	he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then interview him.

Vasant

Vasant,

Attached is a resume for a candidate that might serve temporarily through the summer.  Maybe this could be a stop gap measure until we can locate a full time person.  I would anticipate him working as a summer intern.

Hi!
   Thank you very much for your help.
Here is my resume.
Please let me know what should I do next as soon as possible.
Becasue I have several interview plans with other companies.
But I would like to work at Enron most.
So if I can get the job at Enron, I don't want to
hang around others.

Thank you again.

Vince,

I thought you might just like to have this information: several people have been asking about our trading volumes and whether or not they have decreased significantly. According to the graphs in the attached spreadsheet, the only significant drop in EOL trading came on 09/11 and 09/12. In fact, the largest number of transactions on EOL was on 10/23, which is since many of our problems started.

I am with Enron?s thermal power generation company in Panama. Ours is the largest thermal power plant (320 MW) in a system with over 540 MW in hydro power capacity. In order to better program our operations for the next two years, it would help us to determine the probability of another El Nino event in the next 18 to 24 months. In case of a high probability we could even bring down a barge-mounted plant to provide back up power to Panama?s and other Central American countries which are heavily dependent on hydro power. Panama and Central America suffers serious droughts during an El Nino event.

Whatever help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

amounts can be useful to represent short positions. All options can now be
consistently evaluated on expiration date (zero time to expiry). An error is
still returned if the option has already expired (negative time to expiry).
European spread option models (EUDU, ECMXX, EPMNX) now support an
alternative tree implementation.

Speed Improvement

Our tests show a substantial speed improvement (40%-60%) from version 4.2,
especially for computationally demanding models.


If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this
opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..

Subject:	Re: Meeting with Bob Williams

Vince - - In the last hour, one of my partners has raised an issue about our representation of another client engaged in a significant transaction with Enron, and whether my proposed representation of you would require the consent of that client.  We are trying to sort it out as we speak.  I am hopeful that the issue will be resolved satisfactorily in the next hour, and that I will be on an airplane this evening (albeit later than planned).  In the off chance that we are unable to resolve the issue today, however, and it becomes necessary to postpone my trip, let's hold off setting up a specific time to meet with Bob Williams.

I will call you later this afternoon, as soon as I have further information.

Walt,

I have set up a meeting with Bob Williams,
Enron lawyer, to discuss the issue
of indemnification. The meeting is at 8:30, old Enron building.
Let's meet in the lobby of the building (the old building,
the bigger one) at 8:15.

Please, confirm.

Shirley,

I would like to return the Enron equipment that I have
to the San Francisco Office. Could you check with the
appropriate department to whom I should give the
equipment at the San Francisco Office. 

I know that April Hrach is the Administrative
Coordinator at the SF office and she deals with the
equipment issues. Please ask the appropriate
department to give me a name of a person from the SF
office and also notify that person.

Here is the equipment list:

(1) Blackberry (14879) 1-877-455-1927
(2) Laptop     (40115)

Regards,
Osman Sezgen

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Dharan will discuss various issues and address these questions: Were there red flags? Could we have spotted problems last year? Were there problems with the application of accounting standards or with the standards themselves? What were the accounting issues with SPEs and related parties? What can we learn from this sad event that has destroyed $80 billion and robbed thousands of employees of their jobs and life savings?

Enron wants govt to buy Dabhol stake=20
=20
US energy group Enron on Saturday said it wanted to sell its stake in the D=
abhol Power Company either to the Indian government or to the project's len=
ders. "As the largest investor in the DPC, Enron believes that selling its =
interest either to the government of India or to the project's lenders is t=
he best approach to resolve the protracted dispute," a spokesman for its In=
dian unit said. This follows comments made by Enron chairman Kenneth Lay in=
 Friday's issue of Financial Times that Enron is looking to exit from its I=
ndian venture. The Dabhol Power Company, 65 per cent owned by the Enron, is=
 locked in a bitter dispute with a local utility over a payments default. "=
We want out," said Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay in an interview with the Fi=
nancial Times. DPC which is India's biggest direct foreign investment, had =
signed a contract to supply power to a state-owned utility, the Maharashtra=
 State Electricity Board, from its gas-based plant on the state's west coas=
t. But MSEB stopped buying power in May calling it expensive and defaulted =
on payments jeopardising the project's future.=20

"We have made it pretty clear to the government leadership we are now at a =
point where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners=
 do," Lay said in the Financial Times. Besides Enron, the other shareholder=
s in DPC are US group General Electric and Bechtel which own 10 per cent ea=
ch and MSEB with 15 per cent. Earlier this month Lay had a meeting with Ind=
ia's finance minister Yashwant Sinha to try and resolve the issue but talks=
 ended without any solution. "We have fought this once before, put it back =
together, fixed the contracts, but we don't want to do that again and have =
the same problems in a few years," Lay was quoted by the paper as saying. D=
PC's power plant is being built in two phases. The first phase of 740 mw is=
 up and running and the second phase of 1,444 mw is 97 per cent complete. S=
ome analysts say India's attempts to resolve the Enron dispute is a test ca=
se of its ability to attract more foreign investment. Last week US assistan=
t secretary of state on South Asian affairs, Christina Rocca, said the prob=
lems surrounding India's investment climate could be summed up in a five-le=
tter word, "Enron". "I have to emphasise that it will be difficult for inte=
rnational investors to view India favourably until it (Enron issue) is reso=
lved and in a reasonable manner," she said. (Reuters

Enron wants govt to buy its Dabhol stake=20

US energy group Enron Corp said on Saturday it wants to sell its stake in t=
he Dabhol Power Company either to the Central government or to the project'=
s lenders."As the largest investor in the DPC, Enron believes that selling =
its interest either to the government of India or to the project's lenders =

DPC, which is India's biggest direct foreign investment, had signed a contr=
act to supply power to a state-owned utility, the Maharashtra State Electri=

FIIs okayed DPC loans as provided for Int arbitration=20

INTERNATIONAL lenders of Enron's Dabhol Power Company, including the US gov=
ernment's Overseas Private Investment, have said they extended loans worth =
about $444 million to the project only because the PPA provided for settlem=
ent of disputes by neutral international arbitration. "Had the PPA not prov=
ided for settlement of disputes before arbitration panel in a neutral forum=
, we would not have disbursed loans worth about USD 444 million," DPC's 11 =
foreign lenders have submitted in an application seeking intervention in th=
e energy major's petition, to be heard by the Supreme Court next week. "The=
 PPA constitutes the project's backbone as DPC's entire revenues were to be=
 received from Maharashtra State Electricity Board and were the basis for o=
ur decision to extend the said loans to the $3-billion project". The FIIs s=
ay that MSEB knew that the cost of developing and building the project woul=
d be obtained, in substantial part, from loans provided to DPC on a "non-re=
course" basis by them and other lenders. "MSEB had expressly confirmed, agr=
eed and acknowledged that monies due to DPC from itself would be paid direc=
tly to an account (escrow in this case) created for our benefit and securit=
y", they said. Emphasising for international arbitration in dispute resolut=
ion between DPC and MSEB, the FIIs submitted before the Supreme Court that =
the arbitration provision to be held in London, a neutral international loc=
ation under the UNCITRAL rules, was "critical factor in their decision to f=

BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, July 30, 2001
Centre to keep off Dabhol spat=20

The Centre is unlikely to intervene directly in the Dabhol problem despite =
Enron's willingness to sell its interest in the 2184 mw project to the gove=
rnment. Power ministry sources said the government has made its intentions =
very clear on this issue on several occasions that any direct intervention =
by the Centre was highly unlikely as it would face severe opposition from o=
ther states. "There is absolutely no change in that stance at present," sai=
d an official. The Centre was inclined to play the role of facilitator only=
 in arriving at a solution to the problem, and the central government's rep=
resentative in the re-negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra gover=
nment had already been asked to expedite the proceedings, he said. Enron in=
 a statement on Saturday said that as the largest shareholder in Dabhol Pow=
er Company (DPC), the company believed that selling its interest either to =
the central government or to the project's lenders was the best approach to=
 resolve the protracted dispute between DPC and the Maharashtra State Elect=
ricity Board (MSEB). It stressed that any sale would need to be on terms pr=
oviding a complete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures. The =
company pointed out that the Dabhol issue was clearly having an adverse eff=
ect on the confidence of potential foreign investors to India. "Pursuing a =
buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a timely manner protecting =
India's investment climate and interests of DPC's stakeholders," said the s=
tatement. The company said that while DPC remained open to discussing other=
 viable solutions, it had serious concerns about getting embroiled in a ser=
ies of re-negotiations. It pointed out that no realistic proposal was offer=
ed to the company as yet, and no progress had been made in securing creditw=
orthy buyers that can purchase power at a price that was reasonable for new=
-generation plants. The statement said that until the issue was resolved DP=
C intended to continue pursuing all other remedies under the PPA, such as i=
nternational arbitration, to resolve the issue in a way that protected the =
rights of DPC sponsors, lenders, fuel suppliers and LNG ship owners.=20

Pressure tactic, says lenders=20
Lenders to DPC are unmoved by the company's demand that they take over the =
project and dubbed it as a pressure tactic. The company had said in a press=
 release on Saturday that the best solution would be for the Union governme=
nt or the lenders to take over the project. "We need to run our banks and i=
nstitutions and not a power project," said one senior banker involved in th=
e project. The lenders however accept the fact there is a sense of urgency =
and the government must get into the act faster. At the London meeting last=
 week, DPC showed its willingness to run Phase II of the project on naphtha=
 but MSEB is not willing to give its nod to commissioning of the Phase II=

MSEB, FIs plan roping in Centre for picking Enron equity in DPC , Sanjay Jo=
g

Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and Indian financial institution=
s (IFIs) are planning to make a last ditch effort to rope in the BJP-led go=
vernment at the Centre for picking up the Enron equity in the Dabhol projec=
t through its undertaking as their funds amounting to over Rs 2,500 crore i=
n addition to a guarantee of Rs 3,900 crore to offshore lenders are involve=
d in the project.The MSEB has contributed nearly Rs 800 crore to pick up 30=
 per cent equity in the Dabhol phase-I and the IFIs have collectively lent =
Rs 1,738 crore for both the phases plus a guarantee of Rs 3,900 crore to of=
fshore lenders. MSEB and IFIs sources told The Financial Express that the E=
nron chairman Kenneth Lay's statement on Enron's desire to pull out of Dabh=
ol project has not come as a rude shock, but as an expected one. However, t=
hese sources said that if Enron wants to be out of 2,184 mw Dabhol project,=
 their exist should take place after "tough" negotiations with an active in=
volvement of the Union government.

They have projected various scenarios including the Enron, General Electric=
 and Bechtel collectively agreeing to recover about 50 to 60 per cent of th=
e total equity of $900 million in the Dabhol project from the Industrial De=
velopment Bank of India, which is a rupee lender consortium leader. The MSE=
B and IFIs are aware that the Enron and other equity holders will insist on=
 the full capital recovery and that they will be quite keen on purchase of =
their equity with interest at par by the new buyer.
However, MSEB and IFIs sources are of the view that due to their hard barga=
ining in the presence of the Centre, the Enron and other stakeholders may a=
rrive at certain compromise so that they can recover a substantial amount b=
locked in the project. Secondly, in view of cut in the equity, the loan amo=
unting to over $1.2 billion could be restructured at the lower interest of =
12 per cent and that the moratorium period should be increased. Thirdly, th=
e Centre will lend a financial support to its undertaking to pick up majori=
ty equity and take over the Dabhol project, they feel. According to MSEB an=
d IFIs, in another scenario, the state-run Gas Authority of India Ltd (Gail=
) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) should be asked to take over the liquifi=
ed natural gas (LNG) project in a serious bid to cut the tariff. The per un=
it tariff, which has been average at Rs 8.80, may come down to Rs 2.20 to R=
s 2.40 per unit. The Dabhol Power Company is believed to have spent nearly =
Rs 2,500 crore on the LNG project.

Moreover, the MSEB, which is at present doubtful over the fate of its equit=
y of Rs 800 crore, may pick up 51 per cent equity and appeal to the Mumbai =
based utilities Tata Power and BSES for taking up the balance equity in the=
 Dabhol project. The MSEB and IFIs are keen that the impending issue be res=
olved amicably, especially to avoid the legal battle in India and arbitrati=
on in London. A section of MSEB is confident that the power purchase agreem=
ent (PPA) on the issue of misdeclaration and default on the availability of=
 power by DPC can be proved null and void and there will be no need for the=
 payment of any compensation to DPC. This will enable the take over of Dabh=
ol project by an Indian entity quite possible. Lay seems using pressure tac=
tics Mr Lay's statement on Enron pull out is being seen in the political ci=
rcle as a pressure tactic, especially when the Supreme Court is hearing the=
 DPC's petition on August 6.

'Four states not to buy power at current rates'=20

Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said on Saturday that tho=
ugh four states have expressed their willingness to purchase power from the=
 Enron-promoted Dhabol power project they are not in a financial position t=
o buy them at the prevailing tariff. "All wish to purchase power but not at=
 the current rate", Bhujbal said after a function organised by ex-serviceme=
n. Four states, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka and Punjab had agreed to b=
uy power from Enron's troubled Dabhol Power Project at a tariff as low as R=
s 1.65 to Rs 2.60 per unit during a meeting Godbole Renegotiations Committe=
e had with prospective buyer states on July 26 here. Replying to a query re=
garding the US giant's desire to pull out of the power project in India, he=
 quipped, "jinko jaana hai wo jayenge, unko koi rok nahi sakta" (those who =
wish to leave will leave, no one can stop them). He, however, expressed hop=
e that the current Enron imbroglio would be settled after the Supreme Court=
 delivers its verdict. The state government would deal with the issue depen=
ding on the verdict of the Supreme Court, Bhujbal added.( PTI )

Maharashtra's offer unrealistic: DPC=20

US energy major Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on Friday said that pric=
e proposals made by four states to draw power from the Dabhol project "were=
 totally unrealistic", even as Godbole renegotiations committee reported a =
stalemate in the talks with DPC. Referring to the offer of Karnataka, Delhi=
, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to buy power at a tariff as low as Rs 1.65 and =
Rs 2.60, DPC said, "unfortunately these are totally unrealistic proposals, =
unattainable by new generation liquid plants, including those set up by the=
 public sector". On the other hand, after meeting DPC officials on Friday m=
orning, Madhav Godbole told reporters that currently talks with DPC had rea=
ched a stalemate with interested states quoting lower prices than the US en=
ergy major's expectation. After discussions with four states and receiving =
communications from Haryana and Rajasthan, he said that all these were read=
y to draw DPC's 1,444 mw phase-II power at an average rate of Rs 2 to Rs 2.=
25 per unit. "An overall demand for DPC power is at around 800 mw to 1,000 =
mw, but not all of these is a base load one. Moreover, it is for more than =
half a year, mainly non-monsoon months of November to May," Godbole said. H=
e added that the states had informed the commission that each of them had a=
 regulatory framework in the form of an electricity regulatory authority in=
 place and was bound by a merit dispatch order, which did not allow them to=
 buy costly power (like DPC's) so long as cheaper tariff was available in t=
heir own state.( PTI )

Demand for DPC power only at `particular' price=20
=20
THE Godbole panel today conveyed the power-offtake proposals of six States =
to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) officials. The company was told that there wa=
s combined demand for 800-1000 MW power at not more than Rs 2.50 per unit. =
``One thing is abundantly clear. There is demand for (DPC) power at a parti=
cular price. If the price increases the demand may not be large'' Dr Godbol=
e told reporters. `` We have told Enron that the need for 800 to 1000 MW DP=
C power is not at baseload, nor is it an all-year-round demand. The States =
will require this power only between the months of April to November and th=
e demand will fall during the rainy season,'' he said.=20

Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the pan=
el yesterday. Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking=
 for 300 and 100 MW each. While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs 1.=
65 per unit, other States have said they will not pay more than Rs 2.25 to =
Rs 2.40 per unit. According to Dr Godbole, the company officials will ``tak=
e up the matter with lenders and collaborators'' before the next meeting wh=
ich is expected to be held in August. Meanwhile, according to DPC, the powe=
r purchase proposals presented by various States ``are totally unrealistic =
and unattainable by new generation liquid fuel plants including even those =
in the public sector such as NTPC's Kayamkulam''. Dr Godbole had suggested =
that DPC power ``at competitive rates'' could replace captive power in a nu=
mber of States. He said though DPC had earlier agreed to reduce tariffs by =
50 paise, this would no longer be easy as the project has seen cost escalat=
ion after stoppage of phase II work. `` Our dialogue with Enron is bogged d=
own by two issues-- the plant load factor at which the unit is run and the =
price of power,'' Dr Godbole said. He said there was a need to take a `` se=
rious look at whether demand projections in the country are realistic''.=20

Maharashtra to pay Rs 788cr penalty to MSEB, Girish Kuber=20
=20
MAHARASHTRA has decided to pay Rs 788 crore to the ailing Maharashtra State=
 Electricity Board to compensate it for the damage it has caused the power =
utility through tariff concessions to various sectors. Padmasinh Patil, the=
 state's energy minister, had wanted to give tariff concessions to farmers,=
 which was objected to by MSEB. Even the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory=
 Commission asked the state's energy department to restrain its generosity.=
 The MERC had asked the government not to offer concessions at the cost of =
its SEB and directed it to make a budgetary provision if it wanted to go ah=
ead with its plan. Accordingly, Mr Patil announced last year that the state=
 government will compensate the board. The MERC had set a deadline of Octob=
er 2001 for sanctioning the compensation. The supplementary demand presente=
d to the state assembly makes this provision. "It has been decided to give =
subsidy to MSEB to compensate the loss arising from supplying electricity a=
t concessional rate to agricultural and powerloom consumers with effect fro=
m May 1, 2000," said the demand by the state's finance ministry.=20

Currently, concessions of 55 per cent and 33.33 per cent in the electricity=
 bills is given to powerloom and agricultural consumers. The total expendit=
ure involved in the proposal is estimated to be around Rs 788 crore. The is=
sue of offering concessions to powerloom and agriculture consumers has been=
 hanging fire for the last couple of years. The board last year had raised =
the tariff for agriculture and powerloom consumers which was opposed by the=
 state government for obvious reasons. The government announced a roll-back=
 of the tariff hike only to be prevented by the MERC from doing so. The MSE=
B will now be charging Rs 600 per one horse power pump, bringing down the r=
ate from Rs 1,400, and Rs 185 per loom down from the earlier rate of Rs 300=
. The government has also decided to waive 55 per cent of the Rs 110 crore =
unpaid dues from powerlooms. Delayed payment charges for the defaulters has=
 also been waived and they have been granted three instalments for clearing=
 old dues. According to MSEB's own admission, more than 118 lakh of the tot=
al 130 lakh consumers are being supplied subsidised power.=20

                      Generators/ Power Marketers FERC Meeting Agenda Memo for January 16,  2002 
Introduction 
The Commission has set a very  light agenda for its first public meeting of 2002.  At next week's meeting,  the Commission will address only 20 electric items, in comparison to its last  meeting in which it addressed over 70.  Although a very short agenda, FERC  has chosen to address some very long-standing contentious issues, e.g. FERC's  jurisdictional authority to order public power and governmental entities to  provide transmission service to FERC-jurisdictional entities, phantom congestion  in California, remaining issues of contention over the ISO NE's installed  capacity program, issues contributing to the inadequacy of generation and  transmission infrastructure in the Northeast, and tets of FERC's authority  to waive certain limitations of PURPA to re-certify a Qualifying Facility.   
 
Commission Agenda: http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/sunshine.htm 
Infrastructure  Issues
E-1 Infrastructure  Discussion in the Northeast AD-02-6 - Commission  discussion on topics to be addressed at FERC's upcoming January 31, 2002  conference in New York City on "Energy Infrastructure Adequacy in the  Northeast". 
 
 
OATT Disputes
E-12  Souhwest Power Pool, Inc.   ER99-4392-001 - Order on several requests for rehearing of the  Commission's 12/17/99 order which directed SPP to make several modifications to  its OATT. In addition, another set of filers seek guidance of how to  recover costs for generator and transmission maintenance costs resulting from  SPP rescheduling planned maintenance outages. 
 
PURPA Challenges
E-5  American Ref-Fuel Company of Delaware  Valley, L.P.  QF87-492-003 - Order on American Ref-Fuel's  request for re-certifcation of its qualifying waste-fired power production  facility . This proceeding has been protested by a group that calls itself,  the PURPA Reform Group. It contends that FERC does not have the authority to  change the Public Utility Regulatory Policy  Act ( PURPA) policies on  a case-by-case basis and,  in this case, grant the petitioner waiver of  PURPA 's 80 MW limitation.  FERC and the applicant did,  however,  receive congressional and industry support for this  petition.

Traci,

I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday.
One of the students indicated that he is
interested in a summer internship.
He came across as a very bright person,
very personable.

I can take him as a summer intern.

Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,

Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
Thank you for your time.

I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
in school.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
Thank you.

Vince and Stinson,

I did some reserach on the option visualization.  Here is one of the findin=

Check this web site, the image looks impressive:  http://home.online.no/~es=
pehaug/VirtualWorld/VirtualOptionWorld.html
This is done through a free software LiveGraphics3D and Mathematica.=20

Take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is goo=

What Is LiveGraphics3D?=20

     LiveGraphics3D is a non-commercial Java 1.1 applet to display and
     rotate three-dimensional graphics produced by Mathematica in
     HTML pages. It may be used without charge for any
     non-commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
     and numeric mathematics by Wolfram Research, Inc.. Wolfram
     Research is also responsible for licensing LiveGraphics3D for
     commercial purposes.=20

     LiveGraphics3D enables all Mathematica users to put almost any
     three-dimensional graphics computed by Mathematica directly onto
     a HTML page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
     Java 1.1 (e.g. Communicator 4.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher)
     can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
     software.=20

     Additionally LiveGraphics3D is able to show animations, calculate
     stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
     backgrounds. =05=20

Greg,

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.
More detailed notes by Steve are attached.

I. Major potential projects (in the order they suggested it).

	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market
	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.

	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation.

	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.

	Any project would require review of the market data provided by Enron.  (Is it a  free option for them? -  VK)
 
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments 
   per project, and   fees per transaction.

	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 
	    Enron's participation.

	2. Payment per project that would look like consulting fees. They would like a lump-sum payment
	    first (to expand the staff), followed by consulting fees later. 

	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support
	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.


Recommendations:

	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.

	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with UBS.

	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from
	    Prediction Company.

	Vince

Hi Vince,

How are you? I will be back in Houston for December break as well as the

month of January. If the group is in need of any help, I will be more than

happy to work with or without pay in the month of January.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Candice

Subject:	FW: NAO/AO and Sudden Stratospheric Warming Presentation

To All:

Please mark your calendars for 26 September between 10 and about 11:30 a.m., as we willl be having
a special visitor from Northwest Research Associates who will deliver a presentation on the North
Atlantic/Arctic Oscillation (NAO/AO) and Sudden Stratospheric Warmings.  I encourage each of you
to attend, as this will be a very informative and worthwhile seminar.  

Mark, along with other noted researchers at the University of Washington, Colorado State University, and
the ECWMF in Redding, are beginining to unravel some of the vagaries of the NAO/AO and to develop the
necessary tools to predict wintertime temperature and precipitation weeks ahead of time. I have asked
Mark to start from scratch and spend some time on fairly rudimentary concepts pertaining to the NAO/AO
and Sudden Stratoshperic Warmings.  He then will build up to his research and discuss where he thinks 
short-term progress can be made in terms of skillful wintertime temperature and precipitation predictions. 
Although many of you sat in on my NAO presentation from early this year, I can guarantee you that 
attending his talk will be worth your while. 

Mark's main focus will be to elaborate on what diagnostic tools and modeling schemes can be used to 
anticipate certain extreme phases of the NAO/AO and the likelihood of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings. These 
can, in turn, be used to something about the probability of cold air outbreaks or heavy snow episodes over parts 
of North America and perhaps parts of the world (for example).

In the end, Joe and I plan to take Mark to lunch to discuss a possible research collaboration between him/ECWMF 
and ENRON. 

I will provide the conference room number and any additional information as we get closer to 26 September.

Vince,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, I am attaching below the URL for
our QCF program here at Georgia Tech for your corporate recruiting folks.
http://www.qcf.gatech.edu/
It will be great if we could have your recruiting people meet with our
first graduating class of the QCF program.

Regarding your visit, we'd be glad to cover the coach airfare and
lodging.  How about the first week of October, say on either 10/2 or 10/4,
or the last week of October, say 10/30?  The arrangement would be that you
come in on the evening of a Monday or a Wednesday and give a seminar on a
Tuesday or a Thursday.  Please let me know what works best for
you.  Thanks.

Osman,

This guy is too much.
I would tell him that we understand
that he has to make the best choice
for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat 
his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed
in Enron.

We never had any luck hiring a statistician.
Maybe we shall get one some day.

I had a message on my phone this morning from WIlliam indicating that
he had changed his mind and will be taking another job. He also mentions that
the other organization will give him time to publish his  thesis and he assumes 
Enron would not do that.

I am inclined to give up on him but wanted to get your input before doing so.

June 5, 2001, 1:17AM Houston Chronicle PBS pledge drive alters schedule  By=
 MIKE McDANIEL  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle TV Editor  Paul Hope, like=
 many theater fans, tuned to Channel 8 Sunday night in anticipation of the =
first hour of the joint PBS/CBS telecast of the 55th Annual Tony Awards.  W=
hat he got instead was a travelog hosted by Rudy Maxa. Because this is pled=
ge drive week, Channel 8 did not air the first hour of the three-hour award=
 show, as it has in previous years.  "Channel 8 has made Houston a theatric=
al cowtown by this decision," Hope, a resident actor at the Alley, said Mon=
day.  Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd called the preempting "absolutel=
y indefensible and shocking."  Fortunately, Channel 8 is being more flexibl=
e about a second program that it had originally decided not to air this wee=
k.  Frontline, which airs nationally at 9 p.m. tonight, takes a hard look a=
t California's energy problems and their direct connection to Houston. The =
telecast includes interviews with several Houston players, including Enron'=
s Kenneth Lay.  KUHT station manager John Hesse said Channel 8 became aware=
 of the Frontline story, titled Blackout, and its Houston connection last w=
eek. Because of its local news value, the show will be tape-delayed and air=
ed on KUHT at 10 tonight. It will be repeated at 9 p.m. June 12, when Chann=
el 8 originally had planned to air the show.  "When we learned of the local=
 significance, we obviously wanted that program to air (here) in a timely m=
anner as in the rest of the country," Hesse said.  "We are getting a little=
 bit of heat for the Tony thing," Hesse said. "The problem is, it's right i=
n the beginning of our pledge evening. We had a schedule in place, and a de=
cision was made to stick to that schedule because that was our opportunity =
for fund raising."  Fund drives are vital to keep the station operating and=
 to purchase quality programming.  "When we're scheduling our pledge dates,=
 we try to coordinate the normal PBS schedule with what we determine will d=
o the best for us in terms of fund raising," Hesse said. "We only use about=
 2 percent of our air time a year in fund-raising efforts, and when we're u=
sing that 2 percent, we have to make the most of them."  That's no comfort =
to the folks who were hoping to experience what turned out to be theatrical=
 history being made. Mel Brooks' The Producers -- not only the talk of Broa=
dway but also the entertainment world -- won a record 12 Tonys Sunday night=
.  Most were awarded in the show's first hour -- where Tonys for director, =
choreographer and other categories are handed out. To diehards, the PBS por=
tion of the Tonys exceeds CBS' in that it airs without commercials and incl=
udes behind-the-scenes interviews with directors, composers, designers and =
others.  Hesse explained that Channel 8's pledge-drive dates were set befor=
e the station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys.  The first hour o=
f Sunday's show had direct links to theater talents whose work has been see=
n and heralded in Houston.  David Woolard, nominated for best costume desig=
n for The Rocky Horror Show, is costume designer of The Carpetbagger's Chil=
dren, which opens Wednesday at the Alley.  Doug Besterman, a winner Sunday =
for his orchestrations for The Producers, has done the same for the Frank (=
Jekyll and Hyde) Wildhorn productions that have played here.  Doug Schmidt,=
 a nominee in the scenic design category for 42nd Street, was a designer fo=
r the Alley's Civil War and A Christmas Carol.  Hesse said, "We knew by the=
 end of March" that PBS would co-host Sunday's show, and yet "the decision =
was made to stick with the schedule in place."  Because the Tonys isn't "ow=
ned" by PBS, it could not be used as a pledge show, although Hesse conceded=
 pledges could have been sought before and after.  "There's nothing against=
 the `rules,' " he said. "It's just been our normal method of operation her=
e (to run the pledge drive at 7 p.m.) in terms of our prime-time evening pl=
edge start."  In a related development, NBC affiliate KPRC will not be show=
ing the first episode of a new comedy series bowing tonight. Kristin, starr=
ing Kristin Chenoweth, is being pre-empted by Road to Redemption, a movie f=
unded by the Billy Graham Crusade.  Channel 2 made a decision in March to r=
un the movie 7-8:30 tonight, KPRC general manager Steve Wasserman said. NBC=
 has scheduled the premiere of Kristin for 7:30 p.m. and is not allowing it=
 to air later in prime time, he said. =09

Vince -

The finance faculty and I have reviewed the vita of Richard McMinn.  He
appears to be a very good person but we are attempting to find someone who
is already or has the potential to be a major star to fill the Enron
Chair.  McMinn is not at that level in our judgment even though I am sure
that he would be a good person to have on a faculty.  At our stage of
growth and development, we need to fill tenured positions with extreme care
and with individuals who are or have star potential.

Thanks for bringing him to our attention.

Maureen,

Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I forward it to you.  He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.  Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.  I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.

For now, this is the list of countries for which  we will  probably need the FX and/or inflation curves.  I will send the specifics per Andre later today.

India 
Philippines
Bolivia
Jamaica
Guatemala
Venezuela
Columbia
Puerto Rico	CPI only (I need historical inflation data, as well)
Panama
Brazil		we have current data already
China		we have current data already
Euro		inflation only

I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting/IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already.

Thanks!

Cindy

David,

What about coffee sometimes on Thursday, November 29?
We could have coffee at Hyatt or at the lobby of the Enron
Building (1400 Smith, 2 blocs from the Hyatt). I could show you our
trading floors in the new building.

Please, cc vkaminski@aol.com as well.

Vince

I screwed up on my email.  I am coming THIS week, not next.  Are you still
available Weds or Thurs a.m. breakfast?  I am staying in the Galleria area
but could meet you at the Doubletree or Hyatt at say 7:00 a.m. either day.
Would one of those work for you?

Regards,

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

Dale,

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving 
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case. 

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through
license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?
If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our
power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Dear Vince,
Your collaborator had kindly sent me a new contract proposal 5 weeks ago.He was supposed to have it checked by your lawyers but I never heard from him again.
I have been approached by 2 major software companies
and may sign some kind of agreement with one of them.
I believe it would be better to finalize our project
before it becomes a subset of a huge machinery.
Will you be in London on June 28?
I fly to the States on July 6,will be in New York on
the 8&9 and in Houston on the 15&16 of July
Hoping to see you or get some news

Thanks for your message and the update about the course.

Dear Vince,

I have attached the invoice for the workshop that Beth O'Sullivan and I
conducted for your group last month as well as a summary of the workshop
evaluation.  I am sorry for the delay, but we were waiting to receive more
of the workshop evaluations so that we could provide you a more complete
assessment of the workshop by the attendees.  As it is, we only collected
11 responses of the 17 attendees.

I will also send you a copy of this invoice in the mail and will be glad to
send you the actual evaluation forms completed by the attendees if you
would like to have them.

As mentioned in the attached, we enjoyed working with your group and hope
that you can see the difference the training made in the presentation
ability of the attendees.

If you have any questions about the attached invoice, please do not
hesitate to call me at 713-348-5394.

Again, thanks for bringing us in to conduct the workshop.  I sincerely hope
that you are well despite any changes taking place around you and that you
have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

Sincerely,

Deborah

Vince,

I have updated the Historical transactions spreadsheet, up to yesterday's data, and it can be found as an attachment. You will notice a drop-off in the number of EOL transactions over the past couple of weeks, but at least the figures are not yet at zero! Most significantly, the volumes of the Power desk have decreased.

Jim,

Current headcount of the group is 49, including assistants, associates and
analysts, and  part-time employees. The core group head count is 36 professionals.

I am attaching a spreadsheet that gives you  affiliation of each employee with the primary
unit he/she supports. Some people support multiple units but I ignore such details.

What is shown below are the percentage cost allocations to different Enron units.
The allocations are based on the averages from the last year and will apply to 2002.

Vince,

I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating
in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in
quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is
deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward
to your visit.

On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on
our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership
(http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation
from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in
expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!

The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York.
Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enron's participation
on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program
to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a "first
look" at the "MSCF Resume Book."  From our standpoint, your experience and
counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and
opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.

Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan.
Would you be willing join us?

Hello Vince!

Hope you are well.  Thank you for your presentations.  Just one question,
would you like me to change the name on the presentations from Vince to
Zimin, or should I leave them as is?

Please advise.

Take care

Joanna

Vince -

I had spoken with Joe Deffner concerning your prior conversation on the calculation of our cost of funds.  Is there someone in your group who you would like us to work with concerning the possible conversion of our established cost of funds curve to one based upon zero coupon bonds?  Thanks for your help and please let me know if you have any questions.

Greetings Vince!
=09During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been ponde=
ring yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written=
 programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current l=
ines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these l=
ines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two be=
tween WSCC and SPP.  It would seem to me to be valuable to know when there =
there power supply differences between these NERC regions and when power wa=
s flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For =
once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, th=
e project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in =
the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolita=
n cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being for=
med - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese syst=
em and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect i=
nternally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and=
 power control differences between each of the generating countries.
=09You are the first person that I have told about this.  I didn't want to =
get anyone, especially my immediate supervisors, excited about a technology=
 that I wasn't ready to provide.  I know that once I say that we could do i=
t, the powers that be will want it NOW.  If you think that there is a marke=
t for this imformation I'll sneak out some weekend and collect a bit of dat=
a.  The nearest HVDC inter-tie is just north of Dallas so testing it would =
only take a day or two.  I am currently juggling two running chainsaws, a r=
abid dog and three vial of hepatitis so one more item in the mix won't make=
 much of a difference at this point.  If no one needs to info, I'll just pu=
t the hardware and software on the shelf.

p.s.  Gina and I would like to take you out to lunch or dinner soon to a Sa=
rdinian restaurant.  Let us know when you would be free.  ( Your wife is in=
vited, of course!)

Allen,

I am sorry to inform you that it is too late to arrange a summer
internship now. We have no physical space left to accept
additional interns.

Please, feel free to contact us next February.

Subject:	Summer internship in Enron Broad Band Division

Dear Mr. Vincent Kaminski,

I am a first year student at the Jones Graduate School of Management, Rice
University. Mr. Peter Veruki, director of CPC in Jones School, recommends me
to contact with you about the possibility to work as a MBA intern in your
division this summer.  With keen interest, I would like to have my
internship in Enron to conduct analytical market research or other related
jobs.

I worked for nine years in the business service industry in China, boasting
with diversified experience in market research, strategic planning, and
business development. Years of practice endow me not only the first hand
experience of quantitative analyses and marketing research, but also the
ability to solve problems under the intense competition and challenge.
Furthermore, I learned how to deal with clients from different cultures and
circles. In the past several years, the clients I served include Adobe
software, Dell notebook, HP computers, Disney entertainment, Shell Oil,
Northwest Airline, NOKIA cell phone, Sun servers, and many other global
companies. I had some knowledge about energy industry by participating in
the marketing projects for Shell Gas station and China Petroleum Import and
Export Corporation.

As you will learn from the attached resume, my business experience
concentrates on market research, implementation of marketing strategies, and
business planning. Three years ago, I started APT Netcom with two partners.
I was in charge of both business strategic development and media sales. At
my initiation and leadership, we set up a new Internet-based media sales
platform for advertisers and agencies. In 1999 the newborn company achieved
revenue of $9 million.

Enclosed is my resume with details of my work experience and professional
skills. I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss with you my credentials
in details. I will be available for an interview at your earliest
convenience. Thanks for you attention.

Sincerely,


Allen (Qizhi) Shen

Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Vince

Andy,

Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating
several high profile projects. 

Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
internally from other members of the group: this contribution
may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.

We appreciate your hands-on involvement. It's always the most
important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent interaction
with the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.

Vince

Guys,

Here is what I took away from our meeting:

1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline data.

2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data

3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the right track.

If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can discuss.

Thanks,
Andy

Subject:	RE: Job posting

Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.

The new agenda lists for each session a few speakers, who will make some comments to help stimulate the group's discussion.   The first session will focus upon key issues that we would like to learn more about.  The second session focuses more on what we have learned about gas supply and infrastructure, while the third session focuses more on gas markets and ties to electricity.    
I am looking forward to an interesting and productive meeting.

Thank you very much for your kind offer of helping me

cannot take this opportunity because our class of 2002
will graduate next May.

I have great passion to work in your department as a
part-time employee. Time of morning work is not a
problem for me. I can get up at 5:00 a.m. to prepare
for work.

Thank you again for your help!

Best wishes,

Hi Vince,
 
Hope my mail reaches you. I am really sorry that the Enron saga is coming to such an end. I have closely followed developments through the press. Personally, I continue to be proud to be associated with the company and more specifically with the Dabhol Project. I have learned a lot in my three years at Enron and hope to continue to learn from the experiences of its people.
 
I saw you at Rice a few weeks back, but you were very busy and was hence unable to talk with you. I am leaving for India tomorrow and will return only in the second week of January. Its probably obvious, but the enron debacle has affected my future career options and also does severely constrain me in more ways than one. Hope the lunch offer still stands open, will take you up on it in January. 
 
I hope the holidays prove to be a time of relaxation for you and your family. Wish you a merry christmas and Best wishes for the new year to you and your family.
 
Regards,
Anshuman

Bob,
I used Econ search engin, searched 67 journals about "bid-offer spread" for=
mation, and found
latest research on this subject.  Some abstracts are attached, it seems a l=
ot of studies are already
done. Those titles are very relevent to us.

The address for the search engin is http://www.elsevier.nl/cgi-bin/cas/sear=

 that we can get these papers on line.

Abstract
A probabilistic framework for the analysis of screen-based trading activity=
 is presented. Probability functions are derived for the stationary distrib=
utions of the best bid and offer, conditional on the order flows. By identi=
fying the unobservable order and acceptance flows, our estimation method pe=
rmits the prediction of the stationary distributions of other market statis=
tics. A test is proposed that allows a comparison of predicted and sample b=
id-ask spread distributions taking parameter estimation error into account.=
 The methodology is applied to the screen-based interbank foreign exchange =
market, using continuously recorded quotes on the Deutschemark/US dollar ex=
change rate.=20

Abstract
In this study we examine two factors affecting variance increases following=
 stock distributions: changing bid--ask spreads and the true variability of=
 the underlying value of the firm. Employing data from the CRSP NASDAQ and =
NMS files, we find a relatively minor role for changing spreads. Increases =
in true variances are the major component of variance increases with change=
s in return autocorrelations playing an important role.=20

 Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany
b , Humanities and Social Sciences 228-77, California Institute of Technolo=

Abstract
We examine the prices quoted by specialists (or dealers) who have monopoly =
power to set prices (bids and asks) for a given asset, but who face indirec=
t competition from other specialists who trade in related assets. In the co=
ntext of a simple model where investors have mean-variance preferences, we =
characterize the equilibrium bids and asks quoted by K specialists in N ass=
ets, where some specialists may control more than one asset. We compare the=
 equilibrium spreads as the number (and factor structure) of the assets eac=
h specialist controls is varied. It is shown that for some constellations o=
f initial portfolio holdings and asset covariance it is socially preferred =
to have competing specialists, while for others it is socially preferred to=
 have their actions coordinated (or to have one specialist control several =
assets). In a simple factor model, we show how the optimal specialist contr=
ol structure depends on whether the assets trade as substitutes or compleme=
nts. In some situations it is beneficial to have specialist power concentra=
ted within industries, in other situations, across industries, and in yet o=
ther situations, not to be concentrated at all. ? 1998 Elsevier Science B.V=

Asymmetric information and the bid-ask spread: an empirical comparison betw=

a , School of Banking and Finance, University of New South Wales, , Sydney =

Received 1 April 1998; Accepted 1 September 1998
Abstract
This study examines the components of the bid-ask spread on the Sydney Futu=
res Exchange. The Exchange uses open outcry auction for daytime trading, an=
d switches to a screen-based automated order execution system at 16:30 h fo=
r overnight trading. After controlling for proxies of order flow characteri=
stics, the study finds that screen-based traders are more sensitive to mark=
et volatility than floor-based traders in setting the bid-ask spread. Sprea=
ds from floor trading have a smaller adverse information component but a la=
rger order processing cost component relative to screen trading. The result=
s suggest that floor traders can better assess the presence of adverse info=
rmation than screen traders.=20

Received 29 December 1997; Accepted 23 September 1998
Abstract
We examine the role of limit-order traders and specialists in the market-ma=
king process. We find that a large portion of posted bid--ask quotes origin=
ates from the limit-order book without direct participation by specialists,=
 and that competition between traders and specialists has a significant imp=
act on the bid--ask spread. Specialists' spreads are widest at the open, na=
rrow until late morning, and then level off. The U-shaped intraday pattern =
of spreads largely reflects the intraday variation in spreads established b=
y limit-order traders. Lastly, the intraday variation in limit-order spread=
s is significantly related to the intraday variation in limit-order placeme=
nts and executions.=20

Abstract
We investigate the linkages between the number of dealers making markets in=
 a security, the extent of outside (or nondealer) competition, and the mark=
et bid--ask spread for NASDAQ NMS stocks. The investigation is guided by a =
model that emphasizes dealers' interactions as their inventories change, an=
d predicts that the extent of outside competition limits the bid--ask sprea=
d and the number of dealers. We hypothesize that the extent of outside mark=
et making capital in a stock is related to that stock's institutional holdi=
ngs. Evidence shows that the extent of institutional holdings relative to t=
rading volume proxies for outside competition. For stocks with little outsi=
de competition, the spread is large even though the number of dealers is al=
so larger than for comparable stocks. The component of the spread related t=
o outside market making capital is economically significant (about (1)/(2) =
to 1 percent of price). The composition of volume as to trade size and trad=
e frequency, which is related to the level of institutional holdings, also =
influences the spread.=20

Doug,
Attached is our position paper concerning the topic of TCR derating that will be discussed at the ROS meeting on the 10/30/01.  Typically we need to have material to the WMS one week before the meeting, so if it possible we would like to get your comments by the end of today (please) so that we can get this out to the WMS.

David,
The same timeframe with Legal's comments, please.

 

Thanks,

Dear Mr.Vince Kaminski,

It was very nice to see you in my interview. Thank you
very much for your time and questions. Through my
interview process, I got to know Enron better and saw
many excited things. I think my experience and skill
would be a good fit for Enron and be able to make
contribution with all my exposures. Thanks again for
your attention.


Best wishes

Weidong Tian

Steve,

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates.

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

Vince

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Subject:	Recruiting for weather risk management group




Dear Vince and Christie,

 

I hope that you are both well, and are ready for the onset of summer in Houston!  I was disappointed that I was not able to see you at the final Tiger Team presentations last month due to a family emergency.  I hope that the teams' analyses will be helpful to your work, and echo their appreciation of your involvement and support.

 

I am writing with a question regarding recruiting for Enron's weather risk management group.  My boyfriend, Greg Hunt, is currently seeking opportunities to combine his background in meteorology (MS and 2 years of research at Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab) and an MBA in finance and information technology.  I began thinking about Enron's work in weather derivatives, and realized that there could possibly be a great fit there.

 

I have copied Greg on this message, and would appreciate any suggestions you can offer regarding opportunities in this group.  Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,

 

Heather

Vince,

Enclosed is information on textual mining and expert systems I spoke to you about in the lobby.  

EDS is currently providing commercial applications using experts systems and textual mining to derive value for our customers.  The presentation below has two examples of current applications.  It seems to me that there a multiple applications for this type of program within Enron which would have short payback periods.

Please let me know if you wish to investigate further.

Thanks Loretta. 

FYI- I was told that it was ok for me to stay here on the 19th. So unless anyone else has been assigned this work space I should be ok?
Please advise.

Pravas,

The move for this week-end has been submitted and cannot be changed.  I've talked to the head of the move group.  She is aware that you are in 1968 and will not be moving until later.  This is fine.  Next week we'll schedule your move - I'll talk to you then about what you'll be moving and where.

Thanks,
Loretta

Vince, 

Here is my thoughts on the upcoming reorg.  In my mind,
it seems logical to create a team specialized in EWS trading/origination
support.  

I would suggest Vasant to oversee EBS support.  Where do you
want to put  the power fundamental team ?  Vasant has more 
experience to manage this team although they can be also classified
as trading support.  In term of head counts, I am inclined to let Vasant
supervise this team.

Attached you will find the cash data that I have been using to derive my graphs.

In terms of the method I used to derive the average of $10 million/day, I used the net cash inflows for September and the net cash outflows for October and calculated an average based upon 41 business days.  The average came out to be $6.22 million/day and I then grossed it up a bit to be $10 million even.

Thanks,
Rob

Liz,

Frank Wolak can meet Greg and me in his office and  for dinner Thursday night,
August 16,  at Stanford.
 
Can Greg fly to San Francisco or San Jose  from his Asset Tour trip in late afternoon on that day?


If Greg can get a co plane to go San Francisco on Thursday, we could  fly together to Santa Fe 
on Friday morning, August 17. Norman Packard can meet us on that
day. I could go to San Francisco Thursday morning on a commercial flight.

SECURITY AND BUG NEWS ALERT:
Users offer tips on foiling Code Red

By Jason Meserve

Code Red, the nasty virus that spread to some 250,000 host
machines a couple of weeks ago, could begin another assault
around 8 p.m. EST today, according to an alert from the FBI and
the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center
(see http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0730codered.html). And
systems administrators are taking no chances.

For those that do find the virus, which affects Windows NT and
2000 servers running Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS), the easiest way to get rid of the problem is to reboot
the infected machine. Because Code Red resides only in memory,
it will be purged when the system shuts down. Once the system
is rebooted, users should install a patch from Microsoft that
fixes the vulnerability Code Red exploits. The proper patches
can be downloaded from:

Windows NT Version 4.0:
http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=30833

Windows 2000 Professional, Server and Advanced Server:
http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=30800

Directions for installing the patch and other information on
the virus is also available from Microsoft at:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/tech
net/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp

Anyone running IIS should install the patch listed above.

Bud Nelson, a reader of Network World's Security and Bug Patch
Alert newsletter (http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/bug), says
he found the virus on one of his extranet servers and followed
the steps above to rid and protect his machine from future attack.
But he adds, "I am thinking about removing the network cable
tonight."

Greg Missman, owner of SecureTips.com, provides the following
tip to make sure the patch from Microsoft is properly
installed:

Look in your event log for an entry like this one (this is an
NT IIS5 Enhanced log):

2001-07-20 21:22:03 216.68.15.61 - 120.195.68.58 80 GET
/default.idaNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN%u9090%u6858%ucb
d3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%
u9090%u8190%u00c3%u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a 200
190

(Note: The line will be continuous in the log file.)

This means your IIS server logged a request for default.ida
with the underrun data. If you look right after the data ends
you will see a space and 2 sets of numbers.  "200" is the code
for "OK" and "190" is the size in bytes sent to the remote
host.

A "200" response on this request is very bad and means you
either have not applied the patch or applied it wrong. Reapply
it, then cut and paste the information from the log (everything
after GET) into your own browser pointing it to your own site.
You should get a "414" code after the request in your log
stating that it errored and your server blocked it.

All the hype about Code Red could turn out to be just that -
hype. But the steps for protection are relatively easy, and as
the saying goes, "Better safe than sorry."

Attached is the Dabhol Report in PDF format. It could be that the Enron
server does not accept winzip attachments and therefore, I have converted it
to PDF format. It has also been sent separately to the yahoo email address.

Sandeep

As per our telephone conversation today, I am resending the email message
(report attached) that I had sent earlier. I assume that you must have
received the report as I did not receive any undelivered email message.

Could you me give me a call to confirm receipt of this email.

Today's focus: Flaw in AOL Instant Messenger

By Jason Meserve


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Hole in AOL Instant Messenger discovered

A security flaw in the way AOL's Instant Messenger handles game
sharing requests could be exploited by a malicious user to run
arbitrary code on the affected machine. The victim may be
helpless, short of powering down the machine, to stop the
request. AOL is working on a fix, which will be applied to the
servers that run IM. Users will not have to download a patch.

For more:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0102aim.html


* Vulnerability found in IE 6.0

Microsoft bug hunter Georgi Guninski has discovered one of the
first bugs in the new Internet Explorer 6.0. According to
Guninski, the GetObject() function has a poor security
mechanism that can be easily exploited to transverse local
files and execute arbitrary programs on the affected machine.

For more, go to:
http://www.guninski.com/getob3.html


* Patch release for mutt

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in mutt, a mail user
agent for Linux. The one-byte overflow can be exploited by a
malicious user. For general updates and to get more
information, go to:
http://www.mutt.org/announce/mutt-1.2.5.1-1.3.25.html

Debian users can download the appropriate patch from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-096


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* JS/Seeker-E - A JavaScript-based virus that attempts to set
Internet Explorer's home and start pages to a pornographic
site. (Sophos)

* Win32/Maldal.G.Worm - An e-mail worm that spreads via Outlook
by sending itself to everyone the Outlook Address book and by
searching the infected hard drive for addresses embedded in
HTML pages. Infected messages have the subject line of "ZaCker"
and an attachment called "ZaCker.exe". The virus also will
overwrite a number of file types. (Computer Associates, Sophos,

Hi Witek,
     It was really a pleasure to talk to you after so many years.  Whenever
you have a chance to come to New York, please let me know so maybe you
could come to spend a few days in my home in Greenwich or I could go to New
York to meet you there.

     Thank you for your help regarding book references, and also for a
possible reference regarding a quant to cover energy trading in Market Risk
Management Department that I run at AIG Trading Group.

     Please say the best greeting to all your family, talk to you soon.

Subject:	Agriculture Materials

Ms. Fraser -

Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Harry Baumes and I head the
Agriculture Services area at DRI-WEFA. I have been working with Peter McNabb
regarding ENRON's interest in our agriculture and fertilizer capabilities.
He has asked me to forward samples of some of our short-term oriented
agriculture publications to you.

Peter has forwarded material to you and your colleagues already. The
materials attached are in PDF format. These products include:

US Agriculture Executive Summary
Corn Commodity Update
Cotton Commodity Update
Rice Commodity Update
Soybean Commodity Update
Wheat Commodity Update
Fertilizer Market Assessment

In addition I am also including a recent "Agriculture Commentary". This is a
product that we release on an as needed basis. When there is a major USDA
publication release or a major event that impacts agricultural markets, we
typically release an assessment of the event or publication. For example, on
March 30, the USDa released it Planting Perspective report, we provided our
clients with an Commentary. The outbreak of Foot & Mouth Disease in the UK
earlier this year was an event that led us to release a Commentary. The
Commentary is DRI-WEFA's quick response newsworth items.

Also, to help support clients. We make available to our clients, Planting
and and Harvest Progress Reports. this information is available to
individuals and/or organizations through USDA. The value DRI-WEFA provides
is that we include graphics that enable a comparison of the current year's
progress with the 10 year average and the PROGRESS high and low over the
past 10 years. This detail is available at the national and for each
reporting state.

If you have any questions after reviewing the attached material, please feel
free to contact either Peter or me.

I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and your colleagues at
ENRON.

Have a  nice weekend.

Anita,

Please send this note to all identified participants in the Transmission Round Table-

To all Transmission Round Table participants:

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next "Round Table" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Enron person, but particulars to Walter Coffer.

"Current Transmission Project"

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our "Transmission Round Table" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)

5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

6) Go to work now!

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am a student in a Master's programme in Mathematical Finance due to graduate in August. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative capacity in the
 Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume  in the hope that I might be considered for any available position in your risk
 management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.

I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.

 Yours sincerely,


 Ian McCracken

Subject:	Data Mining Course

Vince,

In the light of our discussion this morning about EOL, I have investigated the possibility of taking a two-day Data Mining Course. I believe this would considerably help in coming up with ideas about how to analyse the EOL database, as well as providing some initial experience in the use of data mining tools and techniques. I found several possible courses that could prove valuable in this regard, and some of these are listed below. The first of these was recommended by Eric (Cope), and is the earliest of the courses that I could find, so I will plan on registering for it unless there is good reason not to.

1. "STATISTICAL LEARNING AND DATA MINING: from Supervised to Unsupervised Learning" - Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (both of Stanford Univeristy); to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sept. 6-7, 2001; Cost = $1,250. (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/MRC/mrc.general.html)
2. "How to Successfully Mine Data" - Dr. Richard De Veaux and Herbert Edelstein (Two Crows Corporation); to be held in Bethesda, Maryland, October 8-9, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.twocrows.com/dmcourse.htm)
3. "Statistical Data Mining" - Dr. Brian D. Ripley (University of Oxford, sponsored by Insightful); to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 15-16, 2001; Cost = $1,800. (http://www.insightful.com/train/ripley.htm)
4. "Tools for Discovering Patterns in Data: A Survey of Modern Data Mining Algorithms" - John Elder (of Elder Research); to be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 16-17, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.datamininglab.com/newcourse.html)
5. "DATA MINING: LEVEL I - An intensive introduction to methods, applications and resources" - Tony Rathburn (The Modeling Agency); to be held in Dallas, Texas, November 27-28, 2001; Cost = $1,095. (http://www.the-modeling-agency.com/training/dm1.htm)

Rudi,

Makes sense. Let's meet with Gordon. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting. 

Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?

I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's
liquidity at some point.

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.   

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.

Vince Kaminski

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. Bob Thomas, Shmuel Oren and I invite you to attend the Power
Systems Engineering Research Center's upcoming Industrial Advisory Board

researchers and industrial members of PSERC. The meeting also has
presentations on PSERC activities and research projects, PSERC business
discussions, current topic discussions, and a tutorial. Our current topics
discussion will be on ISO/RTO issues, and will involve executives from
several ISOs in dialog with university researchers.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We hope to see you there so
that we can talk about any questions you might have about PSERC.

Subject:	RE: Job posting

Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.

Vince,
 
I  wanted to follow up with you concerning our earlier exchange regarding my  brother Vikas Saksena. Have you had a chance to speak to your IT folks? I will  be meeting with Vikas in London by the end of this month and will get a chance  to talk to him in more detail. May I ask him to call you directly. For your  reference his phone number in London is 44 208 343 3298.
 
Thanks

Hello Vince, hope you had a good holiday, dispite it all. I don't know if you received a copy of our end of year issue so I've attached it here. The risk section received some pretty good marks. I don't know what your plans are going foreward, but I would like to keep the communication open. I've been playing around with a few concepts for special sections in the Risk Desk -- tossed around the ideas to a few big fivers, CRO's and the like, guys like Pokalsky and so on. The publication is growing pretty steadily so I think some kind of relationship between the two of us might be good for all involved. Anyhow, would like to discuss the details sometime soon-- what's good for you?
Best
John

   Hello Vince-- we're finally getting around to reviewing that book you
   had a hand in writing -- good stuff to be sure. actually joe p[okalsky
   is helping me out a bit on the math. Listen, the publication is doing
   quite well, I think we go to about 4 or 5 thousand folks these days. I
   was wondering if for the august issue (it drops on or around the 27th)
   you might carve out about 15 minutes for a quick Q&A -- softballs
   mostly, no surprizes. I'd like to dove tail it to the book review. I'll
   forward a set of 5-6 questions in the next day or so. Any chance of an
   interview in the next couple weeks?
   Best,
   John

Vince,
 
I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than  usual.
 
Talk  to you later.
 
Anurag

Dear Colleague,

GasTrader would like to offer you a COMPLIMENTARY trial subscription to GasTrader Newsletter - the only natural gas industry publication that deals with today's critical issue of where natural gas prices are headed, and not where they have been.

GasTrader features weekly analysis and commentary from the industry's leading forecasters, observers, and traders.

GasTrader brings you short and long term weather predictions, useful for planning load and power requirements, as well as price trends, market outlook, and economic analysis.

In addition GasTrader in its' Market Outlook section brings you no-nonsense trading recommendations for the wild and volatile natural gas futures. A key feature for those doing deals tied to the Nymex futures contract.

Check out GasTrader's market recommendations from long time Commodity Trading Advisor and analyst Bill Burson. See if those recommendations help you do better deals and expand the razor thin margins so prevalent today in natural gas marketing.

If you would like to receive your FIVE WEEK COMPLIMENTARY SUBSCRIPTION to GasTrader, please reply to this e-mail and include your name, company, address and phone number. The publication will be delivered by e-mail usually late Friday afternoon giving you plenty of time to formulate your trading strategy for Monday.

We're currently offering a special discount, over 15%  for an annual subscription to those who subscribe by June 1. After the end of five weeks, if you don't want to continue with the subscription, you owe nothing.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Bill Burson,
Editor

I can't thank you enough for your help.  I supported your group as an HR
generalist from February 1998 through year end 1999 when I transitioned it to
Sheila Walton and her team.  As you may recall, I also served as Sheila's
backup (until December 2001) for more senior level work in your group, i.e.,
conducting your PRC meeting.

Thanks again.  Hope you are doing well in spite of the turmoil.

Best regards,

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

How was your Thanksgiving holiday?
I had a good time with an American Family.
They were so friendly and all the dishes were so delicious.
I hope you had a good time too with your family and friends.
These days, I am tasting some internet traffic models.
While reading papers, I am bumping into lots of ideas and getting familiar
with those.
Someday when I contact with traders in the real market, hopefully I would
like to ask some meaningful questions.
I appreciate your time.

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Stan,

Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to
offer the help of my group in providing analytical support in evaluating different options
that are open to us.

One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC
in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts,
but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities.
He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation
of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve
economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation
is attached.

Please, feel free to ask Jim Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
Ehud

Vince, I contacted Albanese and you can see here the reply I got from him.

The experiment I could suggest to test the "Convolution VAR" for non-normal variables 
would be: to generate prices with non-normal log returns and compare VAR based on simulations
versus "convolution VAR" for chosen non-normal distributions.

The spreadsheet Dr.Albanese attached compares different techniques (Monte-Carlo, Historical, Convolution)
on real data. The results are different. It is hard to come up to any conclusion after such experiment.

Hello Tanya,

our method is meant to be used for non-normal distributions. The assumption
of independence works out very nicely in my experience. The key point is
that the kind of principal component analysis we developed is portfolio
dependent, so we rank directions in risk factor space according to their
impact to portfolio returns. The agreement with empirical VaR or backtesting
performance is excellent. I am attaching a test Excel spreadsheet for our
VaR software library, which includes our fast convolution method together
with a variety of variance-reduced Montecarlo implementation.

If I can be of further help, don't hesitate to contact me.

best regards, Claudio

Hi Vince,

Happy New Year.

how are you? how was your Christmas?
how is everything going in Houston?

I am OK.
we went to Scotland over the Christmas.
I joined RWE trading at the beginning of January.
I am quite happy with my choise and I would like to establish myself here.

most people from Research in London either found jobs already or prepared to
wait until god opportunities come.

how are our guys in Houston doing?
what is going on with Vasant , Krishna and other guys?

many thanks,

Alex,

Thanks a lot. I could open our resume.
We hire part-time employees to help
us with our weather effort: the work is
concentrated in the early morning hours
6:00 to 10:00 a.m.

I shall check with Mike Roberts who runs the group
about our needs.

Please, let me know if you are interested in
a summer internship in 2002. The decisions
are made in late January and February and 
you should let me know by then.

Vince

Norman,

Thanks for your message. Still struggling with a trip schedule,
trying to reconcile many different itineraries. I should connect with Greg who is 
in London and firm the plans up  by tomorrow morning.

I am attaching a draft of a non-disclosure agreement. Please, take a look at it
at your leisure and let me now what  you think.

I have also FedExed you some reading materials about the power and natural
gas prices.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Paolo Cadoni and I work for Risk Magazine in London.  I am
contacting you to request your assistance. We have recently had a very
interesting paper submitted for publication, entitled: "Let's Swing Again
(Pricing Non-Storable Commodity Options)".  I would very much like you to
act as an anonymous referee for this submission, if it is not too much
trouble.


Keypoints:
An expectation model with permanent and temporary shocks has been developed
and used to price a swing option (capacity reservation option) on a
non-storable commodity. The model is a hybrid of a permanent shock (binomial
tree) and temporary shock model (reminiscent of Black (1976)). The
flexibility offered by the model's hybrid nature allows it to capture the
empirical behaviour of electricity and gas prices: transient spot price
shocks and calibration  to the futures prices and the futures volatility
term structure.  As the size of the volatility of the temporary shocks is
increased the component of the swing option priced derived from the
temporary shocks quickly dominates the component from the binomial model.
Therefore, a failure to model the transient shocks when pricing swing
options may present a serious modelling error.

I do hope that you are able to help us out. If you are in agreement, I can
email you the paper immediately - we would need the report emailed to us
within around four weeks. Please get in touch as soon as possible.


Many thanks for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Paolo Cadoni

Ehud,

I shall be glad to serve on the re-defined panel.
There may be some things I will be unable to comment

I should finalize my Austin trip plans in a day or so.
I will let you know.

Vince,

Greetings.

1.  Per our communications earlier this year, you had agreed to participate
in a Feb. 22 panel discussion entitled "Future of Energy Trading."

We have now revised the format of the above Conference, so that our current
planning is this:  On 2/22, from 2 - 5 p.m., at the McCombs School of
Business, we will have a panel discussion that will focus on
"Enron/Andersen:  Causes, Consequences and Conclusions."  We will invite
faculty, Energy Finance Group students, other students, other
practitioners, and possibly members of the press.

I write to inquire whether your earlier receptiveness to participating in a
panel discussion extends to this newly-defined topic.

2.  Alternatively, you had mentioned the possibility of coming to Austin in
early-to-mid Feb. to discuss matters with a smaller group.  I also seek to
discuss that matter with you.

I would like to call you this afternoon to discuss these two issues.  Best,
Ehud

I would like to schedule a time next week to get everyone together to discuss correlation methodology in Power.  I'm out of the Office on Mon and Tuesday, but I will be available Tuesday morn for conference call.  Kevin suggested Tuesday or Wednesday morn when I'm back in the office. 

Additionally, I've attached a spreadsheet showing correlations as Kevin suggested.  Using price change shows stronger correlations between gas and power.  However, incorporating this into value-at-risk may create additional issues. 

 

Thanks,
Frank

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Hi Vince,
Just a note to say I hope that you and the other good people I have met over the past couple of years are able to overcome the difficulties you are currently facing at Enron.  As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking.
Again, good luck in whatever you choose to do, please stay in touch, and thanks for your help.

Dear Vince,
Thank you for sparing some time to talk with me about the opportunities at
Enron.
As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I
am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the
opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of
my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project
with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing
Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in
understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a
fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a
project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating
environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy
markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in
honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a
significant insight into the global trading industry.

I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our
conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and
research.

Hoping to hear from you soon.
Best Regards
Prakash

Thanks. I shall ask Shirley to schedule a lunch in 2-3 weeks for me and Krishna with you.
Krishna is about to become a Daddy again in a few days; the end

Vince,

I'm so glad that you can recommend him for our commercial job.  He has some skill sets that our department is shy on.  In fact, I am bringing him back for my boss, Steve Harris, to interview.  I too, think that he would be a good fit.  

By the way, Krishna and Seksan have been very helpful in coordinating some technical analysis of California prices.  We appreciate the support and certainly enjoy working with your group.  Perhaps you, Krishna and I can book a lunch together in mid to late August and catch up on the business issues.  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi all!

First,  the lunch this week is about Enron's partici[pation in the Wharton e Business Initiative (WeBI)--we joined this past year and are engaged in a four year committment ($250,000/yr)  The attendees from Wharton are Prof Raffi Amit, WeBI Director and Professor of  Entrepeneurship;  and Lee Goldring, another WeBI Director. The purpose of the meeting is for a formal presentation about WeBI to engage appropriate Enron business units in the benefits of our more active participation as WeBI members.  I'm not aware that Tom will be here--I believe he was here Monday (I was travelling) ; He told me he'd be in Austin Tuesday and then back to Philly.

As to the Business Plan Competition--please check with Paul LeBeau in A/A recruiting.  It's true that Enron did participate last year.  I reviewed business plans and participated as a judge, along with Barbara Page from (then) Enron Investment Partners. Paul LeBeau and I have discussed the experience and my cost/benefit analysis of the experience with regard to Enron.  He and his group will decide whether to invest in this for 2002.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Thanks!

--Christie.

Lacima is relatively small, but they have two very competent

I am looking right now at a number of options. Hopefully, I shall make a decision

I'm available any time for dinner other than Mondays or Wednesdays
(taking Spanish at Rice)

Thursdays are best, then tuesdays next.

This week, though, taking off Thursday after work to visit my dad in
North Carolina, so gone Friday too.

Even fridays generally OK, though I'd need to bring Mary Jo!

Bottom Line:  How about next Thursday 11/15????

Also, the earlier the better........(office hours 5am-4pm)

looking forward to it......

This analysis was another swag at p&l components. We took the numbers from the daily position reports, backed out the big originations that we new about (e.g. peakers sales) and the other "mistakes" (e.g. the EES $700MM loss), then took out the curve-shift P&L from the backtest data, the balance we said must be some form of "new deal" P&L plus realised p&l etc.
It shows that 2000 was the prop trading year, whereas 2001 was mainly new deals. Of course the whole thing is poisoned by reserve movements.

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with
any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding
our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support 
of other members of my group with skills in different areas.

Subject:	Your Presentation at the UT Foundations of Energy Finance  Class and Subsequent Enron Reception

Vince:

Greetings.

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was.

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public
Affairs Mike Rosen.

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26,
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or
whether you would prefer a subset thereof.

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.:
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters.

Best,
Ehud

John,

A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the
new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.

My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather
groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views,
the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will 
defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.

If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups
under Mike's leadership.

Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks
Here is the message for Jeff:



Jeff,

I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation
at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference
is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).

This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.


Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, 
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the 
agenda for the future.

time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more
controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would
like to share with you a few observations.

1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to
Enron (and the P/E ratio).

A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in
massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this
crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and
our strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management
technology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.

It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can
convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about
the quality of our financial technology. This can be done 
through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.
by reality.

2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.

The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input
information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to
the market observations (as opposed to historical data).

One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks
information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.

One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the
trading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect
between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices 
curves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized 
forward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will 
systematically fail. 

One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically
fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the 
source of problems we see in some books.

3. VaR process management.

Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,
a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.
What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality
of the results.

Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility
for the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization
and resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have
inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used 
currently in the system are 2 years old.

Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view 
some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal
usefulness (and in some case on questionable
understanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to
bring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties

and

Thanks for confirming the  meeting on September the 5th.

We shall be coming on a company plane from San Jose and this gives us
a lot of flexibility in planning of the agenda.

Please, let me know when would you like to start the meeting and we shall
be glad to adjust. I assume you are on Mountain Time

Dear Mr. Kaminski:
I assume that Prof. Oren has sent to you an e-mail in which he  informed of our ongoing purpose of organizing an international conference on Ten  year of Electricity Deregulation and Restructuring. He attached a very  preliminary agenda as well with all the people and lectures committed  already.
I would like to formally invite you to come to Spain by  December 17-18 to give a lecture of around 45 minutes on the key  issues that operators and energy services and trading companies are confronting  in assessing the risk chain in the new deregulated environment business:  adequacy risks, trading risk management, capacity markets, etc.
Regarding budget and expenses, I can allocate $2.500,  plus a bonus should we break even, to cover your traveling and emoluments.  We will take care of the lodging as well.
 
Please feel free to contact me if you need further details. As  soon as we have some more formal description of the Conference and a first  definitive schedule I will send it to you.
 
Let me have your response whenever you are able to do  so.
 
Best regards.

Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Vince

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

Dilbert Newsletter 39.0
-----------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   December 2001



Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
* New DNRC Word
* Boss and Cow-orker quotes
* Plop Version 2.0
* True Tales of Induhviduals
* My Holiday Message
-------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

The 400,000 members of DNRC continue to get smarter and better
looking every day. Case in point: I am typing this newsletter using
telekinesis while watching CNN in an adjoining room. And if I'm not
mistaken, Paula Zahn is trying to flirt with me.


New DNRC Word
-------------

A DNRC member suggests this new word for Osama's terrorist
organization: Al-Qae-duh.

I would love to have been a fly in Osama's beard last year when he
was discussing his plan for global conquest.

Osama: "I have an idea. Let's attack the most powerful
        nation in the history of the universe and then hide
        in caves."

Omar:  "All in favor, say eye!"

That might sound like a crazy plan to many of you, but you need to
realize that Osama grew up in Saudi Arabia where that sort of
strategy has worked in the past. In the November 12th issue of
Newsweek there's a "Special Advertising Section" where Saudi
Arabia's public relations firm describes the wonderful history of
Saudi Arabia. In 1901 a guy named Ibn Saud, along with his cousin
and 38 buddies, climbed over the fortress wall in Riyadh and waited
until the Amir came strolling by. Then Ibn and his cousin hacked
the Amir to death with swords. At this point in the story -- so you
don't think I'm making up this whole thing -- I quote from Saudi
Arabia's own P.R. article: "The Riyadh garrison, demoralized by the
death of their leader, and fearing they faced a far larger force
than 40 men, surrendered."

That's right; Ibn conquered a whole city with 40 men, of which 38
were just standing around watching. Eventually the Saud family
consolidated power, named the country after themselves and formed a
royal dynasty that is still in power. That's the inspirational
story that little Osama learned in school when he was growing up.

Who's crazy now?


True Quotes from Induhviduals
-----------------------------

Here are more true quotes submitted by DNRC members. Most of these
are from managers. As you will see, Induhviduals are confused by
anything involving critters or body parts.

"It's an exercise in fertility."

"Hindsight is 50-50."

"Just use your own excretion."

"You are never going to fail unless you try."

"We're scraping the bottom of the iceberg."

"Today is like the day Rome was built in.  We can't afford to have
any fiddlers."

"The project is going down the toilet in flames."

"He might be barking at a red herring."

"You're treading on thin water."

I think he meant we should cross our T's and dot our I's but it
came out this way: "Be sure we all cross our eyes."

"He's as deaf as a bat."

"We don't want to stick our necks out and get our asses chopped
off."

"I gave him a real mouthful."

"I really took the bull by the hands."

"He doesn't know his hole from an ass in the ground."

"You should talk to her. She is a minefield of information."

"I can't remember but it's right on the tip of my head!"

"You can lead a pig to pearls..." and then he trailed off.

"Thanksgiving is early this year because the first Thursday fell on
a Monday."

"The skeleton is there. You just have to sharpen it and put the
decorations on the tree."

And this last quote, which may or may not have come from Osama: "We
need an escape goat."


Plop Version 2.0
-----------------

In case you ever decide to start your own comic strip and you want
to solicit opinions from other people, let me give you this piece
of valuable advice. You should never -- and I mean NEVER -- give
the comic a name that rhymes with any of the following words:

Flop
Drop
Stop

That little rhyming opportunity was not lost on about two hundred
of you who thought Plop was not up to DNRC quality. Fortunately,
some people actually liked Plop. I read every comment and the
breakdown looks roughly like this:

Loved it:   33%
Liked it:   46% (thought it has potential)
Loathed it: 21%

That's a great response for a first draft of a comic. Comic strips
normally get developed for several months before the public sees
them. You're in on the ground floor.

Version 2.0 of Plop incorporates many of your comments. I renamed
Plop (because Plop was the name of a comic book in the past), I
changed Smokey's species, I made Plop more optimistic, I addressed
the hip-deep mud question and I started to fill out the
personalities of the main characters. Only a few people were
bothered by the physical similarity to the Taliban, so I'm not
going to let that bother me if the comic develops into something
worthwhile.

The new and improved strips are posted on the Web at
http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/ and begin with #21. All
comments and rhyming insults are appreciated.


Induhvidual Baby Names
----------------------

Here is further proof that all Induhviduals should be given the
same name to keep things simple.

--

A doctor friend of mine was on hand for a delivery in a maternity
unit.  The mother named her daughter Placenta.

--

I once knew a person with the tuneful name of Listerine.

--

My wife was a public social worker in South Carolina many years
ago. One of her case families had a daughter named Syphilis.  The
family pronounced it in two parts: Syph-Philis.  One day my wife
asked the mother how they came to name the child Syph Philis.  The
mother said the hospital named her, and she got a copy of the birth
certificate to prove it.

On the birth certificate was an annotation that the child was "born
of a mother with syphilis." The mother assumed the hospital had
named her child for her.

(Editor's note: That one sounds like an urban legend to me. Let me
know if you've heard it before.)


Saving the World
----------------

Here's a fun mental exercise. Try to think of any problem in the
world that wouldn't be reduced if we all did some extra shopping
this year.

How about terrorism? Let's see, if we shop a little extra, that
stimulates the economy, which increases tax collections, which pays
for more security. Ta-dah!

How about unemployment? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> more
hiring.

How about diseases? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> funding for
research.

So I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that buying Dilbert
merchandise will solve every problem in the world. But don't think
the burden falls entirely on you. I'll meet you halfway by listing
some suggestions.

- "God's Debris" - Ponder the collision of science and God

Things Not To Say in a Restroom
-------------------------------

I hope this doesn't spawn a new category, but these two reports
were worth mentioning.

--

As I entered the restroom, a cow-orker who had just finished his
business, turned to me and said, "Oh, hey, Brent, I was just
thinking about you."

--

At my last job, just as I was entering a restroom, a cow-orker
said, "Say, can I grab you when you're done?"



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

One of the young ladies in our office is getting ready for her
"dream" vacation to Mount Rushmore. My colleague asked her to bring
him back a picture of the other side of the mountain. When she
asked why, he proceeded to convince her that on the other side of
Mount Rushmore are the backs of the presidents, on their knees,
with their heads stuck into the mountain. She is so excited that
she is going to look for a special tour of the backside.

--

I went to a home improvement store to buy a new faucet for my
kitchen sink. I did not see the particular model I had in mind, so
I asked one of the Induhvidual employees for assistance.

He said, "We stopped selling that model because it was the number
one theft item in the store." I waited to hear the punchline, until
I realized he was serious.

I might have to find a new home improvement store if they ever
achieve their goal of carrying no products worth stealing.

--

During a round of layoffs at the company, a farewell card for one
unfortunate cow-orker was circulated. People were signing the card
with "good luck!" and "Been great working with you" and so on.
When the card got to the desk of one manager, he did not bother to
read the card.  He just wrote "Happy Birthday" and signed his name.

--

A pool hall put up a sign in their front window that read:
"Profound language prohibited within." I could just imagine some
people discussing the meaning of life and being told to take it
outside.

--

While traveling on business in Norfolk, Nebraska, I noticed a
Ramada Inn sign:

        "Plan your next affair here"

The next day the sign was taken down.

--

At a business lunch, platters of calamari were passed down the
tables. As a platter reached one of the employee's wives, she was
heard to remark during an unfortunate lull in the conversation,
"No, thanks. I never eat anything with testicles attached."

The stricken silence lasted a few moments. Then 150 people lost it.


--

I work in a camera store.  An Induhvidual came in and said his
camera wasn't working and asked me if I could look at it.  I agreed
and said I would check the battery first.  The Induhvidual said,
"I've had this battery for five years and I've never had any
problems with it before."

I changed the battery and the camera worked.


--

I would like to shove a live bear cub up my boss's nose and then
have the mother bear go after him whenever he opens a phone
conversation with, "Hi buddy how's it going yeah me too!"

--

My boss was having a discussion with another employee about some
work rules that pertain to people doing manual labor.  He said
these rules don't apply to us because we don't use manuals.

--

Yesterday my boss called me and said, "Effective immediately, I
want you to stop your current activity and start working on this
new area." When I asked specifically what I was supposed to do, he
replied: "It was not my intention to give you a task today, just a
mind-set!"


My Holiday Message
------------------

I've written and rewritten this section a dozen times. My problem
is that no matter how much I write, I keep condensing it down to
the same thought: This holiday season, as we laugh and eat and shop
and enjoy friends and family, our soldiers are in Afghanistan
risking everything for us. Some of them won't come back. The rest
will never be the same.

Every one of them volunteered. They think we're worth it.

Let's prove them right.



Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Subject:	Quanto Swap

Vince:
Sorry about the delay. Here is the presentation and the spreadsheet for the quanto swap valuation. 

1) The presentation shows the pricing for a particular day of the season. The valuation for the whole season is simply the sum of the prices for individual days.  
2) Notice that as we blend the correlations the covariance term is simply dependent on the time that there is a forecast for HDDs.
3) The spreadsheet shows the hedging for both gas and weather. We need to start long on gas and hold this position up to the point where weather volatility kicks in. Notice that weather variance starts high and declines to maturity reflecting the presence of autocorrelation among past HDDs.
4) It is easy to produce an option model that pays out MAX(P*(D-K),0).

At this moment I and Claudio from the weather desk are talking to gas traders to resolve how to operate the hedging on gas (no problems so far). We are both believrs that this is a great product. If Enron does not lunch it someone else will do it. You may see it as a syntetic storage. 

I will be polishing the documentation and geting into the development of the option model as soon as I finish other assignments. 

  

Thanks.

Hi Vince -- I hope all is well and that you have recovered from the
flooding!

Just want to follow-up on a couple of things:

Firstly I haven't received your packet of information yet, which I'm looking
forward to reviewing.

Secondly, I just found out that a couple of our business guys may be coming
to your area.  So thought it may be interesting for them to meet up with
you.  Would you be interested/available?

Regards, Aruna

Vincent,

sorry for the inconvenient. I have just sent you the paper by fax. I would
appreciate if can let me know if the transmission is ok.

However, it is quite strange what happened to this file. I have opened it
this morning with acrobat reader and it had a pdf extension. I use Acrobat
quite often and sometimes I have problems with particular characters, but
such a thing never happened to me before...

Thank you again for your time and co-operation.

Best regards,

Paolo

Paolo,

I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get
a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that
I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension
.pdf  and begin with teh same string of characters.
Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.


My fax number is 713 646  2503.

Hi Vince,
Just a note to say I hope that you and the other good people I have met over the past couple of years are able to overcome the difficulties you are currently facing at Enron.  As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking.
Again, good luck in whatever you choose to do, please stay in touch, and thanks for your help.

Jim,

Current headcount of the group is 49, including assistants, associates and
analysts, and  part-time employees. The core group head count is 36 professionals.

I am attaching a spreadsheet that gives you  affiliation of each employee with the primary
unit he/she supports. Some people support multiple units but I ignore such details.

What is shown below are the percentage cost allocations to different Enron units.
The allocations are based on the averages from the last year and will apply to 2002.

Liz,

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
Mark Taylor, as well.

Subject:	help finding finance work

Dear Vince,

Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice.  My
concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from
Cornell University and an IT specialist.

I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I
can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  I've been
somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers.
Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three
months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was
probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into
program code quickly and reliably.

I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and
show quick success.  What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in
my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this
combination is also my biggest crutch.  I'd like to engage all my skills,
but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.

Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in
my skill set?  I'm indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.

Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could
offer.  I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team.
If you have any questions for me, please call or email me at any time.

Sincerely,
Chris Pernoud

P.S. If your son ever wants to startup a linux company, I'd be interested in
helping, he could email me at cgp1@cornell.edu.

We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using
your name, address, SSN#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (author of this
piece) have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet was stolen last month an=
d

within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive monthly cell phone package=
,

applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line
approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to chang=
e

my driving record information online, and more.
> > > > >
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case
this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers
and your card numbers handy so you know who to call. Keep
those where you can find them easily (having to hunt for them is additional
stress you WON'T need at that point!).
> > >
File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was
stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a
first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
> > > > >
But here's what is perhaps most important: I never ever thought to
do this. Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SSN#. I had never heard
of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen
and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.
> > > > >
By the time I was advised to do this - almost 2 weeks after the
theft all the damage had been done (there are records of all the credit
checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about
before placing the alert). Since then, no additional damage has been done,
and the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). I=
t

seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax 1-800 525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW) 1-800-301-7195
Trans Union 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration also has a fraud line 1-800-269-0271

Vince, 
I've ended up interviewing 20 people in the Research Group; everyone was very cooperative and insightful.  Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned.
When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.
Thanks again for your interest and support.  I'll keep you informed of progress!

Also, please talk to Andrea Reed and ask who are good targets in the EIM

Paul,

Thanks for your message. Terry left Enron a few weeks ago after many years with the company.
The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586
EB 4712 , steve.kean@enron.com .

I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you. Can you indicate the subject
of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the r=
ichly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created amon=
g members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to "people" =
issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse=
 team environment.  =20
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like =
to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and shar=
e learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron iss=
ues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with y=
ou and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be app=
roved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed a=
nd approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive=
 any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing=
 the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, pre=
viously-published works I've done. =20
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  =
On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture t=
he wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you ha=
ve interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with m=
e further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully,=20

Greetings All,

On October 7th at 2:57 p.m. (CST), Cindy gave birth to our son, Andrew
Joseph Edward.  Andrew weighed in at 6 lbs. 12 oz. and is 19 3/4 inches
long.  This makes him a very light feather weight, but we intend to get his
weight up for future Olympic competition.  Mom is doing fine but feels like
she has been hit by a truck.

We thank you in advance for all of your good wishes!

I hope this e-mail finds everyone in good health...and perhaps with a
renewed desire to baby sit in the bayou.

Amitava,

Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with.

Cheers,

Subject:	Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical snapshot+performance data for model development

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots											Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end			12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end				12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end					12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end				12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

Subject:	Having Iris visit London

Hi Amitava,

We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.

I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Scott

Greg,

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.

I. Projects (in the order they suggested it).

	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market
	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.

	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation.

	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.
 
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments 
   per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.

	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 
	    Enron's participation.

	2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.

	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support
	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.


Recommendations:

	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.

	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with UBS.

	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from
	    Prediction Company.

Gary - 

Thank you for the referral.  Obviously, this individual is very intelligent and highly skilled - but I do not see a fit for th e analyst/associate program.  

I will have my group send a letter to him indicating our decision not to bring him in for interviews for the pool.  

I did have one suggestion for you though.  You may want to pass his resume by Vince Kaminski for his review.  Vince has specialized needs and this candidate may be better suited for his group.

Thanks again, 

Traci

Vince,

Thanx for the quick response.  

I really want to provide Jose the opportunity to be heard and discuss theory more than specific details.  A lunch or breakfast informal meeting would suffice.  

If your Karma continues to work, we may start strategically place you on 32 for AGA days or I may keep you for customer negotiations in 4th quarter.

Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

Barabara,

I had a lunch today with Rob Ladd from Duke (company, not university).
He is a Rice graduate and I mentioned to him the seminars that Enron was sponsoring.
He is willing to talk to you about substituting Duke for Enron as a sponsor of the 
seminar program. 

Please, contact him at rtladd@duke-capitalpartners.com.
His cell phone number is 704 756 5354.

I am working on the power price time series for you but I may run out of time.

DNRC Update
-----------

There are 400,000 people in the DNRC, each more attractive,
generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free
Dilbert Newsletter. Maybe that's a coincidence, but I'm starting to
doubt it.

My Patriotic Duty
-----------------

I've been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic
services in this time of global conflict. I don't think I'd be a
good candidate for Special Ops. I'd be the
one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying, "Hey, guys, I have sand
in my shoe! Is anyone else hungry? Can I use my flashlight now?"

I'm already donating money to patriotic causes, and I bought some
plastic flags made in China, but I felt I needed to do more. Then
it hit me. There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my
entire life: dehumanizing the enemy. In a sense, that's been my
full-time job for years. I just need to replace the word
"management" with "Taliban." So let's get started.

I've been trying to figure out the Taliban's long-term strategy and
I think I got it: They're trying to reverse evolution. Their
uncontrolled body hair is a good start. Living in caves was an
obvious step too.

The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the
children. But they've made great strides in that area. Have you
seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat
on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day? No math, no
social studies, just rocking and chanting. For PE they use sticks
to whack stuffed dummies labeled "Bush" and "Blair." I'm not sure
how they know how to spell "Bush" and "Blair." On any given morning
they're probably whacking dummies labeled "Tqwft" and "Upxpgt" but
it's a good aerobic workout either way.

Just for fun, ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum
could NOT be accomplished by, for example, a monkey: Rocking back
and forth? Chanting? Beating a dummy with a stick? Even if a monkey
only got a "D" in chanting, he would still graduate with honors
from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking
and whacking.

As I write this, our generals are trying to figure out how to get
the Taliban out of their caves. They're running sophisticated war
game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence. I
have one word for them:

                       bananas

I don't want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious
insults. As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil, I am willing to
promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal
footing with everyone else who doesn't read the Dilbert Newsletter.

Now that we've dehumanized the Taliban, let's get on to the
important work of dehumanizing our bosses, cow-orkers and family
members.


Induhvidual Confusion
---------------------

Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others. For
example, they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving
wildlife, vision and their own pants. See for yourself in these
true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers, submitted by
DNRC members:

---

A VP was speaking at a meeting and said, "Well, you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make him crap." Someone up front said,
"That's drink...can't make him drink."  To which the VP said,
"That's stupid."

---

"In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed horse is king!"

---

A cow-orker once said, "Looks like he's thrown a wrench in the
monkeyworks."

---

"A two-prawn approach is necessary."

---

Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the
other day. We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he
said I was "preaching to the blind."

---

"He won't last, he's just a flash in the pants."

---

One of the employees called in to say that she couldn't come to
work because she "...had to have an autopsy."

---

My boss was telling a very involved story about something that
happened to him. He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a
philosophical summary: "Sometimes fact is stranger than truth."

---

"It's a catch 20-20."

---

Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors.
An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to
ensure success for a campaign and his reply was "Don't worry; I've
got an ace up my hole."

---

At a management meeting, my CEO said, "Our company is like a living
orgasm." Now that's what I call job satisfaction.

---

I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having
achieved a goal. The Induhvidual replied, "It was nothing. You
planted the seed, and I ran with it."

---
In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to "the carrot at the end
of the tunnel."

---

"We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this
one."

---

These all came from the same boss:

"Vision is in the eyes of the beholder."

"Part of the verbiage is a language thing."

"Eventually, I want it now."

"It's not that kind of zero."

"There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions."

"In the last year, you've turned around 150%."

---

When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch
room, our secretary remarked to our group that she couldn't stand
him because he was "so ego-testicle."  One of my cow-orkers spit
coffee out of his nose, which just added to the moment.

---

"I think you might have hit the nail on the button."

---

"...caught between a rock and a wet spot."

---

And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said:

"I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought
of a name for you."

Holiday Gift Ideas
------------------

When I'm not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you,
I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations. I believe a gift
should acknowledge the recipient's unique personality and
interests. That's why I organized these suggestions by personality
defect.


For Heathens, Vulcans, Skeptics and Dogmatics:
----------------------------------------------

My first non-Dilbert book, "God's Debris" (now in hardcover), is
full of thought experiments about souls, free will and science that
will have your friends and family arguing with each other for
weeks. Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might
even be some slapping.

The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put
more thought into the gift than you really did. Imagine how smart
you'll seem when you say, "I found all the errors in reasoning. I'm
sure you will too."

We probably didn't print enough copies of "God's Debris" for the
holiday season (really) - it's way more popular than I expected --
so if it's meant to be a gift, act now. Get several for your smart
friends or get just one and let people borrow it.

You can find "God's Debris" at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/unitedmedia/107-5126509-7932516


People With Short Attention Spans:
----------------------------------

I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who can't
handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of
entertainment. For more severe cases of attention deficit, consider
the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner.

Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient, full of
unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving
brilliance.

You can find these calendars at the following links:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715712/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715690/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


People Who Are Hard To Shop For:
--------------------------------

I recommend my new book, "When Did Ignorance Become a Point of
View?" It's a compilation of Dilbert comics that won't clash with
anyone's home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness
because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who
has.

Tip: When it's being unwrapped say, "You'll like this unless you're
dead inside." That prevents most people from complaining, which is
similar to being happy.

This book is available at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


For Dyslexics:
--------------

For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page
Dilbert, my book "Debris God's," my and book, "When Become Did a
Point of Ignorance View."

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/


People Who Stand Too Close:
---------------------------

Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints,
Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:

http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.

The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or
collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.


Plop, The Hairless Elbonian
---------------------------

Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic
strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless
country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isn't a good time to launch
a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So it's on the
shelf, probably permanently.

You can see the experimental strips at:

http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/

Let me know what you think.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members
of the DNRC.

The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand
reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my
relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took
me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had
pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still
intent on using it.

---

When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after
my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating
that my name is the same as my father's.  I called the bank's
customer service number and asked that their records be changed to
use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).

The customer service rep said, "I'm sorry, sir.  My computer
doesn't have Roman numerals."

---

I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil. During one performance,
where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under
their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing
complicated acrobatics at the same time, an Induhvidual behind me
said to her companion, "That must take a lot of practice."

---

At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeare's books
because, "The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS!"

---

At the grocery store, the checkout woman scanned all of my items
then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar
code so she could scan it.  She asked, "Do you know how much this
is?"

I said, "I've changed my mind, I don't think I'll buy that today."

She said, "Okay." I paid her and left.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Vince, 

I hope all is well with you considering ...

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's webite that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Just wanted to write a quick note to say thankyou for your assistance and advice over the the last 5.5 yrs. It was really a privilege working with such great people. I may be back in the office within the next few weeks so hopefully I can track you down on 19 & say good-bye. 

I shall be returning to the UK on Dec 23rd, and will proceed to look for a job along with the other 1,500 ex-employees.

Well it's been quite a ride & I'm pretty much ready to get off & move on. 

I hope that I have the opportunity to meet with you again. Please do look me up if you are ever in London. 

Kind regards,

Soma

Everybody,

this week our regular meeting will be devoted primarily to 2 subjects:
1. Simulating power prices in VAR;
2. Capturing correlations across commodities as well as across term structure of
forward prices.

Research will present some suggestions based on data analysis.

Detailed agenda is enclosed.

Please, let Shirley Crenshaw know if you are not planning to attend.

Tanya.
