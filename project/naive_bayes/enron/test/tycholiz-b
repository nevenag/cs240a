Progress Using Cows As An Example Feudalism You have two cows Your lord takes some of the milk ----------Fascism You have two cows The government takes both hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk ----------Pure Communism You have two cows Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk ----------Applied Communism You have two cows You must take care of them but the government takes all the milk ----------Totalitarianism You have two cows The government takes them both and denies they ever existed Milk is banned ----------Pure Democracy You have two cows You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk ----------Representative Democracy You have two cows Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk Mexican Democracy You have two cows The government takes both and drafts you into the army ----------European Democracy You have two cows The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply If there arent any they invent some They pay you not to milk the cows They take both cows shoot one milk the other and pour the milk down the drain They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows ----------American Democracy The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it After the election the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures The press dubs the affair cowgate but supports the president The cows sue you for breach of contract Your legal bills exceed your annual income You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy ----------Capitalism You have two cows You sell one and buy a bull Your herd multiplies and the economy grows You sell them and retire on the income ----------Enron Venture Capitalism You have two cows You sell three of them to your publicly listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank then execute a debtequity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back with a tax exemption for five cows  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven

government takes both and drafts you into the army ----------European Democracy You have two cows The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply If there arent any they invent some They pay you not to milk the cows They take both cows shoot one milk the other and pour the milk down the drain They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows ----------American Democracy The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it After the election the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures The press dubs the affair
