Allegheny Energy Supply Company Salt River  Project and Sempra Energy Res ources Announce Open Season for Proposed  Desert Crossing Gas Storage and T ransportation System   IMAGE  IMAGE  IMAGE  IMAGE    PHOENIX Jan  10 PRNewswire -- The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation Syste m Desert Crossing is holding an Open Season for customers interested in c apacity beginning today and extending through Feb 8 2002     Open Seaso n is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora ge capacity in a storage facility andor transmission capacity on a pipeli ne submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha se the capacity     Upon completion of the project the Desert Crossing sy stem will include a 10 billion cubic foot high-deliverability natural gas  storage complex and associated pipeline located in the Hualapai Valley no rth of Kingman Arizona  The associated pipeline spanning roughly 300 mil es from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona is projected to be an 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple x with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou thern Nevada see map of proposed system at httpwwwdesert-crossingcom       Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company the generation and trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy Inc NYSE AYE  Salt River Proj ect SRP and Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Energy NYSE SRE   said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven market-respons ive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest ern United States for power and peak period gas supplies Limitations on na tural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada along  with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro ject attractive     As proposed this project with its north-south pipeli ne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers and consum ers options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap acity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets commented Michael Morrel l president Allegheny Energy Supply Company The increased storage and t ransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr ices which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas      S RPs associate general manager of power construction  engineering David  Areghini concurred  As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi ng new gas-fired power plants it is important that we increase our ability to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies  The Desert Crossi ng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu mers and others in the Southwest for many years     The additional natur al gas supplies will help balance the regions escalating energy demands e specially those of electric generators as well as provide the potential to help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest said Dwain Boettcher v ice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources The ho urly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to  transform the way storage service is offered in the future     Customers  participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent ed flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga s supplies in the Southwest  These customers will be able to optimize thei r portfolios because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwests e nergy crossroads     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg ulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the  Open Season Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of the Open Season To participate in the Open Season and for more informatio n about Desert Crossing visit

Amy --------- Inline attachment follows ---------From  EricEHirstcom To EricEHirstcom Date Wednesday August 1 2001 121655 GMT Subject Dear Colleague The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper The California Electricity Crisis Lessons for Other States which I wrote The paper is available on the Publications page of my website wwwEHirstcom httpwwwehirstcom  Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper Here is a summary of the paper California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future That future as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994 envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants Although the first two years of restructuring beginning in April 1998 seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disaster for Californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilities Part of the fallout from Californias electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry Although a few states have decided based on the California experience not to restructure I believe that is the wrong outcome Instead the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work competition is not to blame for Californias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand and prices affect market outcomes Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000 Section 3 the heart of this paper offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry This section makes several points 	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads 	Ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loads maintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support large regional markets and provide fuel to power plants 	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs ie couple retail and wholesale markets 	Create honest retail competition avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors 	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks 	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ancillary services and transmission congestion 	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation and vertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission Ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improve reliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options But this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern high-tech society electricity is our most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment Also electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state Finally competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks

Watson Kimberly Cc Subject	CEC Infrastructure Report The California Energy Commission has issued its final report on the California Infrastructure which is to be voted upon by the Commision on Wednesday  Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report 123 pages  Theres an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages  Although as stated in the summary the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter  Ill keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting  gh IN NEW REPORT CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY Constrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas prices in California last fall and winter according to a report issued last week by a committee of the California Energy Commission The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the issue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state After taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others the report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved Insufficient receipt capacity within California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas Co pipeline system both contrib-uted to the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000 the Sept 24 report said The CEC is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the report The revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame entirely on that noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels during times of high gas prices As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California buyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other Whether prices during this period were in whole or in part the result of a free markets rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium or entirely the result of price manipulation is beyond the scope of this report wrote Commissioner Michal Moore presiding member of CECs electricity and natural gas committee Pointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint RP00-241 against El Paso Corp pending at FERC the CEC added that it had every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented by the CPUC The report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El Paso system in recent years The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California and not the upstream customers This is due in part to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to firm capacity on the El Paso system It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment to deliver capacity paid for by California the report noted Moores committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version from the CPUC The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co which all called for consideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California IF 27 Aug 1 The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the range of 15 to 20 IF 13 Aug 4 The report went on to suggest that California can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a regulated cost-plus environment Under price regulation adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme temperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes Under todays conditions that is no longer the case Moore added that the states virtual complete reliance on gas for electric generation has contributed to the new dynamics surrounding capacity planning More than 100000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council region demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid the report continued saying the CEC was encour-aged by recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERCs stated intent to expedite review of such proposals The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co is developing 375000 Mcf day of additional receipt capacity which should be ready by the end of the year Also Pacific Gas and Electric Co plans to add as much as 600000 Mcfday of capacity by 2003 according to the report It observed that intrastate pipelines in particular those in Southern California ran at close to full capacity at times this and last year which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate pipelines to gas consumers including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001 High prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUCs recent approval of SoCal Gas plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County IF 2 July 3 In addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs the report recommended that the state analyze the consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the flows of natural gas and electricity between California and the Southwest US and Mexico According to the report the state also should encourage in-state gas production re-evaluate design criteria for the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand consider gas curtailment mechanisms optimize storage and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state The 123-page report is available on the CECs Web site wwwenergycagovreportsindexhtml The attachment below is the final CEC Infrastructure

on Lessons from California I just got this and thought you might find it interesting as well Amy --------- Inline attachment follows ---------From  EricEHirstcom To EricEHirstcom Date Wednesday August 1 2001 121655 GMT Subject Dear Colleague The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper The California Electricity Crisis Lessons for Other States which I wrote The paper is available on the Publications page of my website wwwEHirstcom httpwwwehirstcom  Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper Here is a summary of the paper California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future That future as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994 envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants Although the first two years of restructuring beginning in April 1998 seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disaster for Californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilities Part of the fallout from Californias electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry Although a few states have decided based on the California experience not to restructure I believe that is the wrong outcome Instead the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work competition is not to blame for Californias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand and prices affect market outcomes Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000 Section 3 the heart of this paper offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry This section makes several points 	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads 	Ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loads maintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support large regional markets and provide fuel to power plants 	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs ie couple retail and wholesale markets 	Create honest retail competition avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors 	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks 	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ancillary services and transmission congestion 	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation and vertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission Ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improve reliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options But this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern high-tech society electricity is our most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment Also electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state Finally competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers Eric

February 3 2002 Dear Folks -First of all thanks to all of you who responded to the need for financial help in our medical work in Bolivia I cant recall experiencing such generosity We are going to be able to give them more than they requested Plus several people are already on the list to go down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange getting medical supplies to the clinic Wow Thanks The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to the truth and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious and spiritual well being We have become fact fundamentalists I also deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing with terrorism The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood What follows is a full text of the presentation Is The Story Youre Telling With Your Life the Truth A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them Not very long answered the Mexican But then why didnt you stay out longer and catch more asked the American The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family The American asked But what do you do with the rest of your time I sleep late fish a little play with my children and take a siesta with my wife In the evenings I go into the village to see my friends have a few drinks play the guitar and sing a few songs I have a full life The American interrupted I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you You should start by fishing longer every day You can then sell the extra fish you catch With the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat With the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers Instead of selling your fish to a middleman you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City Los Angeles or even New York City From there you can direct your huge enterprise How long would that take asked the Mexican Twenty perhaps twenty-five years replied the American And after that Afterwards Thats when it gets really interesting answered the American laughing When your business gets really big you can start selling stocks and make millions Millions Really And after that After that youll be able to retire live in a tiny village near the coast sleep late play with your children catch a few fish take a siesta and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase Journey Into Wholeness It is so easy for those of us in the West to think that that journey is out there somewhere in the outer world The goal of spiritual work is to become a self Or to become aware of the Self I cant adequately explain to you what this self is It is the center and at the same time the circumference of the personality It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness The Self is known as the Christ in Christianity Journey into Wholeness The root meaning of the word holiness is this wholeness Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a dignified place in our personality Usually for those of us in the Western world our need as reflected in the story of the Mexican fisherman is relatedness relatedness to ourselves as well as to others This is the principle of equality Ive spoken to you about so often We who speak English are limited to one word for love In Sanskrit there are ninety-six words for love We are highly specialized in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings Jesus and other Eastern spiritual teachers saw the outer world to be of little importance The place where the kingdom of God was was inside and among us For us however reality is in the outer material physical world One of the ways this has affected Christian theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique so distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death The religion out of which we came Judaism thought that after death what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the sunrise Yes it has individuality while it exists as a separate entity but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality Does a drop of water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea Well yes and no Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more Jesus knew that the ego was a great troublemaker for us We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals To threaten this notion of who we are is hell We protect what we call our individuality at all costs Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual human life You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do Those were the questions that shaped by the way what became our Bible After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the questions Who are we and what are we to do ee cummings once wrote To be yourself in a world that is doing its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into let us say a Methodist church During the sermon the visitor got so excited that whenever the preacher made a point the Pentecostal man would scream out Praise God or Hallelujah or Amen The ushers were so distraught about the Pentecostals behavior that the head usher went down the aisle and whispered to him Youll have to keep quiet The pastors right in the middle of the sermon The Pentecostal man said Keep quiet How can I keep quiet Ive got the Holy Spirit To which the usher said Well you didnt get it in this church The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make You see he didnt have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit had him And thats the problem with much of our theology We wish he had the Holy Spirit Theres a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit in the nice neat tidy confines of our categories and barriers Wed like to put God in a box Get this Nobody has the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit always has us and given our Western orientation that scares us so that we resist and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails We want a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable and controllable We want a religion that is safe A journey that is predictable There is no true spiritual journey that is that way We modern people have been victimized by own modernity Of course weve benefited - we have the sciences technology modern medicine even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and spiritual life For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality If God cant be proved by modern means then God must not be Second modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality -with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts Modern Western culture is the only culture in human history that has identified truth with factuality We are as Marcus Borg calls us fact fundamentalists If a statement isnt scientifically or historically factual it isnt true These two things are serious mistakes and deadly to the journey inward Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact fundamentalists Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true at all This is why they emphasize the literal and historical factuality of biblical texts They both agree - facts are what matters If I had a magic wand that worked one of the things I would do is to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of these positions are What weve got when it comes to having faith today for most people is whether they can believe iffy things or not That to most people is what Christianity has become It is as if what God wants most from us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true And if you cant believe them then you dont have faith and probably arent a Christian Listen carefully Faith has to do with your relation to God to Self Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not Im going to come back to this in the weeks ahead Let me see if I can give you an example One of the questions that has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what Jesus view on violence might be This has been raised since the events of 911 What would Jesus have us do Does professing to be Christian mean trying to live as Christ might live And if so why arent we doing what he asks us to do First of all I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in response to 911 My hunch is not much His interest was not in that sort of thing Besides he had little political power If we went to him and asked I think he would probably tell a story He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist Thats what the parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time Who are you he might ask Then tell a story to us as we stand there with our mouths open and scratching our heads Maybe he would tell a story like this One day a rabbi in a frenzy of religious passion rushed in before the ark fell to his knees and started beating his breast crying Im nobody Im nobody The cantor of the synagogue impressed by this example of spiritual humility joined the rabbi on his knees Im nobody  Im nobody The custodian watching from the corner couldnt restrain himself either He joined the other two on his knees calling out Im nobody Im nobody At which point the rabbi nudging the cantor with his elbow pointed at the custodian and said Look who thinks hes nobody Ill tell you something that might be misunderstood I think that one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus What God is interested in is saving human beings That being the case what we must do is be human The Christian conspiracy Im going to call it against being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be like Jesus A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan WWJD The goal was to ask before doing any and everything What would Jesus do If Jesus were here today would he have worked for Enron Would he have been on the board of directors If Jesus were here today would he go to church Which one The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go swimming because we had a lot of water in our town Would he be a Republican or a Democrat Would he be involved in the political process The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this by the extravagant way that he lived his life He wasnt married he didnt hold down a job he didnt have to raise kids The Roman church has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual dimension neither did his mother What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love The extravagant way that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that God has for us Boundless love Inexpressible love It is like God comes down and puts arms around us and says This is how much I love you Now love yourself like that This was the thing that marked the ministry of Jesus So Soren Kierkegaard writes To will to be that self which one truly is is the opposite of despair How do you do that Well to be the self you truly are is to have a particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you cant To accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and compassionate about our limitations It is like you get up from where youre sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have compassion for that person It is that kind of acceptance We are not to be like Jesus We are to be Christ-like There is a world of difference Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people All of the stories that you find in the New Testament are like that Look at the stories of his ministry If a man can restore sight to a blind man he gives that person a new lease on life a new self-confidence If a man can absolve a prostitutes guilt in lasting forgiveness he gives her the gift of self-respect The crippled the insane the leper the tax collector the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in need of self-esteem and he extended it to them The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the moneychangers out of the temple It may be temporarily embarrassing to be kicked out of your accustomed place of business but it has been known to lead to self-respect The message is Youre made for something better than this You are loved by God This self-compassion is foundational for the abundant life and Im sure that the response Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest of life is this kind of love He would tell a story One of his central teachings was You shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free But first its going to mess with your life and upset you So let me tell you a story about Truth to ponder This story is from the Ethiopian culture Long ago Fire Water Truth and Falsehood lived together in one large house Although all were polite toward each other they kept their distance Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room Fire constantly leapt out of Waters path One day they went hunting together They found a large number of cattle and began driving them home to their village Let us share these cattle equally said Truth as they traveled across the grasslands This is the fair way to divine our captives No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood Falsehood wanted more than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment As the four hunters traveled back to the Village Falsehood went secretly to Water and whispered You are more powerful than Fire Destroy Fire and then there will be more cattle for each of us Water flowed over Fire bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone Water meandered along cheerfully thinking about more cattle for itself Falsehood meanwhile whispered to Truth Look See for yourself Water has killed Fire Let us leave Water who has cruelly destroyed our warmhearted friend We must take the cattle high in the mountains to graze As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain Water tried to follow But the mountain was too steep And Water could not flow upwards Water washed down upon itself splashing and swirling around rocks as it tumbled down the slope Look and see Water is still tumbling down the mountainside to this day Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop Falsehood turned to Truth and said in a loud voice I am more powerful than you You will be my servant I am your master All the cattle belong to me Truth rose up and spoke out I will not be your servant They battled and battled Finally they brought the argument to Wind to decide who was the master Wind didnt know Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether Truth or Falsehood was more powerful Some people said A single word of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth Others insisted Like a small candle in the dark Truth can change every situation Wind finally returned to the mountain and said I have seen that Falsehood is very powerful But it can rule only where Truth has stopped struggling to be heard And it has been that way ever since I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is that he would likely tell a story And then he would remind us that we ourselves are telling a story with our lives After saying that perhaps he would ask Is the story you are telling with your life the truth No matter where you go this week no matter what happens

Requirements under FERC Order on Reporting CA gas sales In preparation of the new reporting requirements mandated by FERC there are a couple of items under Question 1 that we need to decide on regarding the method of data retrieval  These are b  the terms and effective date of the contract h  the rate charged in MMbtu Rick - Currently the effective or execution date is not captured anywhere  I will need someone on of the Almas or Josh to extract all TW contracts and populate this info onto a spreadsheed  Prospectively this info will also need to be captured with each new contract Kim - With regard to the rate charged I am concerned with how the information will be captured and stored  Its virtually impossible to use the current CBS rate system because at the end of the month there is a great possibility that these FT rates to the Cal border will be buried into a calculated blended rate due to capturing incremental fees for alternate point usage  Also as I mentioned in a previous e-mail to TK we need to ensure that the IT rates are updated in the rate system promptly Don - After your initial review of the data request did you have any other concerns regarding data retrieval and automation of the process  I will need to do some investigation regarding what it might take to add some additional fieldsidentifiers Please let me know what your thoughts are Thanks

with details just to make certain that we head into the month collecting all the information we need to be compliant  In particular now that we will have to report nominated vs scheduled to the Cal

this weekend  She says I should not plan on being able to go  She said if it were just a month later I might could make it  But she says that even if I get the surgery scheduled soon that there will be a lot of rehab and that first of Oct is too soon to stop rehab  I was hoping to get some definite answers to questions today but neither my regular doctor who said she would call me back today after she received the information on the tests done by the neurologist etc nor the nerologist who I left a message for called me back  So I am not positive about anything  The neurologist made it sound like the recovery from this new microsurgery was not that difficult or long but he was not specific about the exact period Do you have any back-up takers for going on the trip in the event my

x-rays  Tomorrow I have something called an EMG -- electro-myogram -- sounds similar to the old myleograms so I just assumed it would be similar -- dye into the spinal cord  take pictures  However Staci looked it up on the Internet for me and reported that it is a series of needle probes into various muscles to check for nerve problems and is somewhat painful -- just what I want at this point   Surely doesnt sound too great  oh well still hope to find something out by tomorrow around noon I did hear from a friend of mine who had something similar a few years ago she opted for some injections into her back which worked so that would be better than surgery or continuing like this at least The neurologist did say last week that it is not necessarily my back altho that is the most likely cause of this but said that it could be something in my hip  So maybe Ill have a number of options like physical therapy injections etc and not just surgery --Dot -----Original Message-----From

good stop and may even be helpful to your current condition Stay flat Kim -----Original Message-----From 	McCoppin Dorothy Sent	Sunday July 15 2001 1243 AM To	Watson Kimberly Subject	Back etc Update -- went to see neurologist on Friday only got in that early because I practically yelled at a number of people for several hours on Thursday -- I guess they think people can afford to wait 6 weeks to see if they feel any better  They were willing to set me up with an appointment in Sept can you imagine Anyway the neurologist knew what nerve is pinched but not where it is getting pinched where the problem is coming from -- could be my back or my hip  Having x-rays and cat scan on Monday pm with something called EMG on Wed  Let you know what I learn --Still flat on back in HoustonDot

Christi --  I dont think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 e ither and we are proceeding under the same schedule  Several rehearing re quests were submitted including one for ENAEES  However note the follow ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENAEES western commercia l and government affairs folks I noted you deleted your message without re ading it  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O MB ruling a good sign 20 As detailed in the attached FERC notice the Office of Management and Budge t OMB has approved FERCs Information Collection Request for Reporting o f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market through the six-month emergen cy period that will expire on 13102  Emergency reporting requirements a re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations  Howev er it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re porting requirements could be extended OMB has advised FERC that if it decides to request renewal of the Informat ion Collection Request after that date it must address certain issues as p art of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit di scussion  As you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of th e FERC order ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems  with FERCs estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co llection of information  We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep o ur records in that manner  We manage our business on an aggregated basis  and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale   We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo rting requirements past 13102  FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 93002 to coincide w ith the end date of its mitigation plan  OMB questioned the practical uti lity of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they d id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way  OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d ata manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation woul d likely be artificial  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti mates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of th e names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request  While we would  not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be  that the OMB action will affect their final decision  At the least it sen ds a signal

3 unit at the San Juan Compressor Station  877-795-3687 pin 47557720 Overview  for those uninvolved to date In a walk through of the San Juan Station with the Team Thursday eveni ng 816 it was noted that severe settling issues on yard piping existed  T he Team had been working with Engineering on developing an action plan to a ddress over the last several months  Upon a visual inspection we requested that the Team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover dirt re moved immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself  This would provid e the necessary time to follow up with Engineering and attain feedback on t he status of the project and implement remedies  The Team had a contractor on location the following Monday 820 and work removing the cover was com pleted this Monday 827  However the expected results were not achieved  In other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stre ss concerns were eliminated  We requested that a structural engineer be se nt to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping  He was on location Thursday morning 829  In a phone conversation with Phil Di ckenson Trigon structural engineer he mentioned that his immediate concer n was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses  However  no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input th e data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations  He did offer that at a minimum we stand a good chance of exceeding the 5 desig n factor but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a c onclusion  We asked that he work through the evening if required to prov ide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity   While  waiting on Trigons report we notified the Team and asked that they contact Foutz  Bursham local pipeline contractor and get an evaluation from the m on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to m ake the repairsreplacements  4 to 5 days  We then requested that the Ro swell CDC Ernie DeLosSantos determine the availability of approximately 1 50 of X42 356 wall 10 pipe 12 ea Y42  365 wall 90s and 1 ea Y42 365  wall 45  all material is available at Redman Supply in Farmington 20 Conclusion   20 Mr Dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us tha t we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels  The stress levels cal culated by Dickinson were in excess of yield as follows  109 of SMYS at  the connection between the recyclesurge line and the discharge header and 101 of SMYS at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10  recycle line    His recommendation was that the piping be cut and re-wel ded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe supports not subject to subsidence be provided Conference calls with Engineering Spalding Eisenstein Rance Pebdan i Minnoti  were set up to review the data with Mr Dickenson and it wa s decided to have Greg McIlwain on location Monday in conjunction with Mike McCracken to initiate the necessary repairs  After much discussion with D ickenson with regards to the modeling performed Engineering indicated that the system is Operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early  next week when repairs are made  The repairs will be isolated to the 3 un it only so the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days 48 hours  Howe ver furhter evaluation by McIlwain will confirm timelines 20 If anyone has questions through the weekend prior to Mondays call I can be reached at

using your Special Services assessment Its not an expansion as there is no increase in certificated capacity So nothing ventured nothing gained -----Original Message-----From 	Donoho Lindy Sent	Thursday October 25 2001 941 AM To	Jolly Rich Roensch David Huber Lee Cc	Harris Steven Watson Kimberly Gottsponer Morgan Subject	Installation of Pigging Facilities I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities OO Agreement  Lee could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following Special Services  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator TW and the Operating Committee TW  NWPLRepresentatives  If NWPL agreed their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest  If we did obtain their approval future OM cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners  Weve agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 35 escalator starting in 2001 Addition or Expansion  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate  If they participate they share in the cost at their ownership interest but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest  If they dont indicate a desire to participate in 60 days we can proceed with the Expansion without any approval but also no cost sharing  Also any incremental OM associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion I think if we went the Special Services route we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost  They probably dont have 260000 15MM  174 sitting around in a budget somewhere that theyd like to fork over for these facilities  Rich what do you think  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities Recommendation  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion I think we should notify them that its a necessary Special Service and ask for approval  to pass along their share of the cost but to be prepared to eat 100 of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future OM attributable to these facilities FYI their ownership interest is still officially 223 since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times first by me and twice by Lynn Blair  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4198 expansion of the facilities their ownership interest will be 174
