and although it is not perfect it is a big improvement over what we have today   Therefore I and my team support  Enrons endorsement of the PJM Proposal with your timeline condition Thanks for all your good work -----Original Message-----From 09Novosel Sarah 20 Sent09Wednesday September 05 2001 730 PM To09Presto Kevin M Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Lin da Fromer Howard Allegretti Daniel Hoatson Tom Subject09RE Support of PJMs Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO Kevin I think the PJM proposal looks pretty good as a first step  As we discusse d in Houston the proposal gives us a single day-ahead and real time energy market for the entire Northeast but it does not get us everything at firs t  For example on Day One PJM proposes to retain the 4 existing control  areas and allow the individual control areas to redispatch in the real time market for local transmission constraints  This could result in New York  continuing to manipulate the market in an attempt to keep prices down but  as we discussed in Houston and as Andy Ott has confirmed it is highly un likely that PJM will allow New York to continue this type of market interfe rence once PJM is in charge and running the market  Also by leaving some  of the existing systems in place PJM has aptly responded to the New York a rgument that local reliability in New York must be maintained so that Ne w Yorks opposition is seen for what it is -- an attempt to delay indefinit ely an RTO in the Northeast Enrons support of the PJM proposal would be very helpful in mediation sinc e we are seen as a big player in the region and because the other two propo sals on the table are sponsored by the New York TOs and the New York ISO an d envision a new RTO system based on the PJM Platform changed by as-yet u ndefined Best Practices from the other two ISOs and New York has indicat ed it thinks a lot of its market design is a best practice and these ot her options will not begin operation for 3-5 years at best Nevertheless even though we here in Washington think the PJM proposal look s good it is important that you and your team are also comfortable with it   If you all have not had an opportunity to review the proposal to ensure  that you are satisfied with it then I would propose that we not sign Enron s name onto the proposal  We can talk about the proposal in more detail a nd even have Andy Ott available for a conference call or a trip to Houston  to answer any questions you may have  If you need more time then I think  we should follow this route instead even if it means we cannot lend our su pport for PJM at this time Please let me know what you think Sarah -----Original Message-----From 09Presto Kevin M 20 Sent09Wednesday September 05 2001 741 PM To09Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard

Allegretti Daniel Hoatson Tom Subject09Support of PJMs Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO As I mentioned to each of you today we plan to sign Enrons name as a memb er of the One RTO Coalition in support of PJMs proposal for developing a single Norhteast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market i n the Northeast  PJMs proposal is attached  As you may recall I gave yo u a copy of PJMs proposal and we discussed it when I was in Houston a coup le of weeks ago  The main concern with PJMs proposal is its timing -- the ir time line provides for an implementation date of November 2003  We have talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation  process and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively but they are unwi lling to change their target date in their proposal Because we disagree with the PJM date we propose to have Enron Power Marke ting Incs name included on the list of supporters of the proposal with  the following footnote 09While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance  of PJMs proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein  Enron 09Power Marketing Inc dissents from PJMs date of November 2003 fo r implementing the single RTO in the Northeast  Enron believes that the PJ M proposal 09can and must be implemented by December 2002 and that extensi on of the implementation date past December 2002 is unnecessary and contrar y to the 09Commissions RTO policy established in Order No 2000 This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJMs timing in comm ents to the Commission after the Judge submits his report due on September 17  In those comments we can go into much greater detail about the need  for quick implementation Please let me know if you have any suggested changes to the footnote or if  you disagree with our proposed strategy  We will address this issue on Thu rsday at mediation I thought it was going to come up today which is why I called each of you so if you have any comments or concerns please let m e know as soon as possible20 Thanks Sarah 09  File PJM Market Design Proposalpdf

Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower To all The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system  This is for informational purposes only  Please let me k now if you have any questions or need clarification on any points 20 Over the last few weeks a few of us have been working to test an EES deal  in Enpower St Lukes - Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal  The dea l is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses A ncillarys and ICAP  The TD is a pass through  We only tested one site  out of the ten  Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest stru ctures available  Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the s ame time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will hel p highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its curren t state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes 5-6 minutes to save  We booked 100 months approx 83 years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc too k 8-9 hours to book Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book it takes a total of 25-26 hou rs to book energy ancillarys only 1 line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes 1 hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least  four therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours Once we got a book to run it took 25 minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deal s Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accoun ting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation proce ss  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting   As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve  shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently ha ve an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting  Currently this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower  All hedges will become desk to desk i nstead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower  Position and PL reports  will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS 09 Here is a breakdown of what it took to rebook this trade Week 1 May 14-18 Read Contract Get Batch model as well as a breakdown of value between Energy Ancillary s etc Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model in Excel to check valuation Week 2 May 21-25 Continue working on Full Requirements model Work with Risk Management Stacey Whites group to set up delivery points  and curves in Enpower09 Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect   We h ad gotten about 13 of the deal booked by the time we realized this At times the database tables would run out of space because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database  This would keep us from entering any new data Week 3 May 29-June 1 Finished Excel Full Requirements model  The EES Batch and the Wholesale mo del tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP  The current ICAP curves are            MW-day and they are not calculated u sing the correct numbers of days ie June and July have the same MWday p rice even though there are 30 and 31 days respectively in each month   This can be fixed in the curve files  In the future we should mark the cur ves as Kw-month Again we ran into problems with the test database Completed booking in Enpower Week 4 June 4-5 Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation portcalc to work Discovered deal entry errors in booking 09

Rogers Presto Kevin M Lavorato John Cc	Wagner Joseph Subject	RE ERCOT Delay Risks Rogers Given the Senate hearing results from Friday I would certainly start building in some margin The prevailing feeling was that there is no reason to start dereg if the systems cannot handle it To their credit however the politicians stated that we need to know this sooner rather than later as there are significant ramifications if we are to delay it The committee was cognizant of the financial exposure and also the erosion of public confidence in the event of a further delay The speed of completing customer switching is expected to ramp up now so that all pilot customers will be switched by mid to late Oct That leaves one billing cycle before dereg So the latest we should know there is going to be a delay is Thanksgiving ERCOTs past inability to inform the market of their delays should be resolved as they were heavily chastised for their commercial incompetence The senate committee is also getting more actively involved as the skewed representation is concerning them-competitive retail has minimal voting rights Recent changes in pricing mechanisms show that the ISO is very sensitive to the political forum and so I believe they will be a little more responsive to their demands That is probably why the ISO has taken to fixing price by not using the market bids when liquidity is light This increases the uplift costs which are currently estimated around 050 MWh All in all the wholesale operations are still sub-optimal but I believe if the switching does occur then we should be ok The concern is the margin for error- the ISO will know late November giving you only a month at best Restructuring these contracts to coincide with a threshold of completed switches would be the way to go In the meantime Jean Ryall is working to monitor the next round of hearings In addition we should be able to get access to the chairs of this committee if need be Let me know if you have any questions Doug -----Original Message-----From 	Herndon Rogers Sent	Friday September 07 2001 1000 AM To	Presto Kevin M Lavorato John Cc	Wagner Joseph Gilbert-smith Doug Subject	ERCOT Delay Risks KevinJohn -I am becoming concerned that ERCOT will not achieve full open access by 1102  Our sales are virtually all commencing 1102  A delay will result in foregone margin and possible incremental losses until such time we can physically serve  For example we will possibly be forced to serve our customers with regulated utility gen service until such time as ERCOT can fully implement direct access  The cost are greater than our retail gen product and greater than our sales price  loss of margin  incremental losses due to costs above sales price  make sense I have expressed this concern to EES Origination  Margins are extremely tight in ERCOT approximately 200 Mwh above offer and if we build in a feereserve to account for this risk we will probably shut down the TX effort  Our competitors absent Shell are apparently not consideringpricing this risk  In fact the incumbent utilities have a natural hedge  If open access is delayed then their customers just continue to pay higher tariff rates thus they are incented not to assist in a speedy transition I suggested that at a minimum we reserve margin until we have a better feel for transition status but obviously received no nods of approval  I will get with Steffes on Monday to get a feel from him and Doug if you could provide your thoughts as well  I am afraid we may have no choice other than imposing some price component to reflect this risk which could lead to our being viewed uncompetitive in the marketplace One possible mitigation is to amend our contract to begin upon full transition date or such earlier date if allowed This would at least limit our exposure to loss of margin vs additional incremental losses associated with our obligation to serve with reg gen  Joe can you review contracts and determine what our obligation to serve is under existing contract and whether you think this idea would help mitigate I would like al of your thoughts as any move like this will receive significant resistance Rogers

To	Nowlan Jr John L Arnold John Presto Kevin M Goughary Jim Wilson John L Belden Tim Cc	Eichmann Marc Richter Brad Shults Bob Subject	REFCO Project Update Gentlemen I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all  Unfortunately Refcos headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse  They suffered no human losses from the disaster but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability To briefly summarize the discussion so far ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refcos customers  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit Refco   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil natural gas and electricity  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform transaction fees and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor FitzgeraldE-speed All that being said they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks  Attending will be Gary Weiss SVP Refco Group Ltd LLC and President  CEO of Refco FX Ltd LLC and Joe Murphy CEO Refco Futures Ltd LLC  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business and discuss the possible structure of the deal  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 230pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed Refco currently has some 175000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors  locals down to individuals  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors locals and high net worth individuals  If this proves successful phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them they become Eligible Contract Participants ECPs able to execute derivatives  So they believe that the majority of the 175000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback Regards John Cummings

Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower To all The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system  This is for informational purposes only  Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any points Over the last few weeks a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower St Lukes - Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses Ancillarys and ICAP  The TD is a pass through  We only tested one site out of the ten  Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest structures available  Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the same time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its current state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes 5-6 minutes to save  We booked 100 months approx 83 years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc took 8-9 hours to book Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy ancillarys only 1 line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes 1 hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least four therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours Once we got a book to run it took 25 minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accounting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting  As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently have an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting  Currently this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower  Position and PL reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS Here is a breakdown of what it took to rebook this trade Week 1 May 14-18 Read Contract Get Batch model as well as a breakdown of value between Energy Ancillarys etc Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model in Excel to check valuation Week 2 May 21-25 Continue working on Full Requirements model Work with Risk Management Stacey Whites group to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect   We had gotten about 13 of the deal booked by the time we realized this At times the database tables would run out of space because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database  This would keep us from entering any new data Week 3 May 29-June 1 Finished Excel Full Requirements model  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP  The current ICAP curves are            MW-day and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days ie June and July have the same MWday price even though there are 30 and 31 days respectively in each month  This can be fixed in the curve files  In the future we should mark the curves as Kw-month Again we ran into problems with the test database Completed booking in Enpower Week 4 June 4-5 Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation portcalc to work Discovered deal entry errors in booking

Wounding of the Source to Sink Beast Yesterday at the Midwest ISO we successfully managed to quash the MISOs at least one source-to-sink reservation proposal MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on transmission reservations and felt that the Entergy SourceSink policy was too restrictive but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point was too relaxed  Their proposal was that at least one reservation on a tagschedule must have the true source-to-sink otherwise the tagschedule would be denied for improper use Representatives from CINergy Duke Dynegy ACES Ameren and LGE worked with me to fight this concept arguing that it was effectively identical to the Entergy SourceSink policy in almost all cases  After a meeting and two conference calls in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually pressed for their option we finally managed to convince them that it was unacceptable The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows 1 If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation specified accurate source and sink the tagschedule will be approved 2 If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink but analysis indicates the transaction can flow without compromising reliability the tagschedule will be approved 3 If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink and analysis indicates the transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability ie the transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint the tagschedule will be denied While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want it allows us a great deal more flexibility that the Entergy SourceSink barrier while at the same time allaying the MISOs reliability concerns  Effectively this allows us to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of taggingscheduling without a loss in transmission priority  Not only will this give us more flexibility within MISO but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under the IRCA This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy SS policy is not required for reliability as other entities are able to meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are necessary As an aside we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will allow for partial redirects of service on a short term basis the Separate proposal referenced in the attached document  This will allow us to accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy but reduce the availability risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is taggedscheduled  These two proposals when combined will allow us for much more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached  Proposal 4 Discussion item Confusing PORPOD Naming Discussion Item MISO Proposal  time of scheduling and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs -

Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower To all The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system  This is for informational purposes only  Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any points Over the last few weeks a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower St Lukes - Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses Ancillarys and ICAP  The TD is a pass through  We only tested one site out of the ten  Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest structures available  Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the same time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its current state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes 5-6 minutes to save  We booked 100 months approx 83 years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc took 8-9 hours to book Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy ancillarys only 1 line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes 1 hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least four therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours Once we got a book to run it took 25 minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accounting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting  As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently have an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting  Currently this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower  Position and PL reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS Here is a breakdown of what it took to rebook this trade Week 1 May 14-18 Read Contract Get Batch model as well as a breakdown of value between Energy Ancillarys etc Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model in Excel to check valuation Week 2 May 21-25 Continue working on Full Requirements model Work with Risk Management Stacey Whites group to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect   We had gotten about 13 of the deal booked by the time we realized this At times the database tables would run out of space because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database  This would keep us from entering any new data Week 3 May 29-June 1 Finished Excel Full Requirements model  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP  The current ICAP curves are            MW-day and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days ie June and July have the same MWday price even though there are 30 and 31 days respectively in each month  This can be fixed in the curve files  In the future we should mark the curves as Kw-month Again we ran into problems with the test database Completed booking in Enpower Week 4 June 4-5 Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation portcalc to work Discovered deal entry errors in booking

Wounding of the Source to Sink Beast Yesterday at the Midwest ISO we successfully managed to quash the MISOs at least one source-to-sink reservation proposal MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on transmission reservations and felt that the Entergy SourceSink policy was too restrictive but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point was too relaxed  Their proposal was that at least one reservation on a tagschedule must have the true source-to-sink otherwise the tagschedule would be denied for improper use Representatives from CINergy Duke Dynegy ACES Ameren and LGE worked with me to fight this concept arguing that it was effectively identical to the Entergy SourceSink policy in almost all cases  After a meeting and two conference calls in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually pressed for their option we finally managed to convince them that it was unacceptable The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows 1 If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation specified accurate source and sink the tagschedule will be approved 2 If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink but analysis indicates the transaction can flow without compromising reliability the tagschedule will be approved 3 If at the time a transaction is taggedscheduled the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink and analysis indicates the transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability ie the transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint the tagschedule will be denied While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want it allows us a great deal more flexibility that the Entergy SourceSink barrier while at the same time allaying the MISOs reliability concerns  Effectively this allows us to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of taggingscheduling without a loss in transmission priority  Not only will this give us more flexibility within MISO but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under the IRCA This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy SS policy is not required for reliability as other entities are able to meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are necessary As an aside we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will allow for partial redirects of service on a short term basis the Separate proposal referenced in the attached document  This will allow us to accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy but reduce the availability risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is taggedscheduled  These two proposals when combined will allow us for much more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached  Proposal 4 Discussion item Confusing PORPOD Naming Discussion Item MISO Proposal  time of scheduling and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs -

PRNewswire -- A unit of Williams WMB incnewsquoterediraspsymbolusWMB today announced a 10 million strategic alliance with the University of Oklahoma OU to enhance weather and climate research technology development and undergraduate and graduate meteorology education This commercial arrangement the largest of its kind in the US between a private corporation and a university meteorology program is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows OU to expand its top-tier meteorology programs while Williams receives exclusive weather analysis and forecasting tools This will give Williams a globally competitive advantage in energy marketing and trading while related educational and research activities are expected to produce for Williams the nations most qualified meteorologists and weather impact decision makers This is a partnership between business and higher education where both parties benefit Keith E Bailey Williams chairman president and CEO said This alliance provides Williams access to weather research and technology that is dramatically superior than traditional government weather services and customized to Williams unique needs With weather being the number one driver of volatility in gas and power markets we expect to see a significant return on our investment This history making agreement between Williams and the University of Oklahomas School of Meteorology a national leader in its field is a dramatic demonstration of the power of a private sector-university partnership in the creation of economic productivity and growth and the expansion of knowledge said OU President David L Boren I predict that this alliance will become a national model for joining together American international leadership in higher education with private sector creativity and vitality We are deeply grateful for the confidence placed in this outstanding program at the University by Williams Highlights of this expansive agreement include  Unique advanced weather and climate prediction capabilities tailored by the University of Oklahomas Weather Programs specifically for Williams weather-sensitive businesses  A grant of 81 million over five years to fund research in advanced weather analysis and prediction at the Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms CAPS  This includes funding for a supercomputer that will be most powerful among all

Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses Ancillarys and ICAP  The TD is a pass through  We only tested one site out of the ten  Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest structures available  Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the same time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its current state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes 5-6 minutes to save  We booked 100 months approx 83 years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc took 8-9 hours to book Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy ancillarys only 1 line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes 1 hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least four therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours Once we got a book to run it took 25 minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accounting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting  As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently have an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting  Currently this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower  Position and PL reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS Here is a breakdown of what it took to rebook this trade Week 1 May 14-18 Read Contract Get Batch model as well as a breakdown of value between Energy Ancillarys etc Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model in Excel to check valuation Week 2 May 21-25 Continue working on Full Requirements model Work with Risk Management Stacey Whites group to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect   We had gotten about 13 of the deal booked by the time we realized this At times the database tables would run out of space because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database  This would keep us from entering any new data Week 3 May 29-June 1 Finished Excel Full Requirements model  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP  The current ICAP curves are            MW-day and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days ie June and July have the same MWday price even though there are 30 and 31 days respectively in each month  This can be fixed in the curve files  In the future we should mark the curves as Kw-month Again we ran into problems with the test database Completed booking in Enpower Week 4 June 4-5 Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation portcalc to work Discovered deal entry errors in booking

To	robertbensonenroncom jeffkingenroncom kyleschultzenroncom douggilbert-smithenroncom mattlorenzenroncom pauljbroderickenroncom tommayenroncom mikecarsonenroncom cc Subject	Load Forecasting Technology To whom it may concern My name is Craig Carmichael  I am a PhD student at Iowa State University working under Dr Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab Please lend me your attention for a brief moment  Enrons team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very near-term future  If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you  If I am way off base on my assessment please let me know and I will go somewhere else  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS Here are some of my credentials so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email 1  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer 2  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques 2  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd 3  Saved ComEd millions of  over the last couple years because of this 4  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly 5  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta 6  My software will be the new learning engine of NEAs NOSTRADAMUS future v50 7  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUSs new training engine not yet released 8  Am the worlds best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods This is the situation I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced forecasting methods  In 1999 I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison under Robert Abboud working at ComEd through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University  The models were the most accurate available  At the time ComEd was using the EPRI models NEAs Nostradamus Tesla and the ISU models those that I developed  Still I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology  Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price Since I have felt oppressed by the system being a student I have awaited graduation am finished mid-July to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting This is unpublished provocative state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke even the multi-million dollar EPRI models and only I know how they work  The technology could also put Tesla out of business  The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs  Robert Abboud from ComEd Excelon and now RGA Labs knows who I am  Rick Hunt the project manager from New Energy Associates does also since I wrote the software for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine Ok  Here are the possibilities 1  I am making all of this up and didt really invent leading forecasting technology 2  I am a nut who doesnt even know what hes talking about 3  This guy couldnt possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself 4  Maybe theres something to what this guy is saying  We might as well send him a data set to test his claims I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I dont act now  Within the next 6 months someone will probably own my technology besides myself  I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your in-house modeling efforts Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle then I will not disappoint you  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies  Let me show you that Im not making all of this up  I will show you flaws in other gems I hope this email wasnt too long  My family  I as of now have a fairly uncertain financial future until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job  Because of this I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property  If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession then I will go to the 2 spot on my list and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today  In some way shape or form in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron Thank you for lending me your ear  I hope you dont think Im a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email Craig Carmichael cgcarmicuswestnet

Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower To all The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system  This is for informational purposes only  Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any points Over the last few weeks a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower St Lukes - Roosevelt part of the Beth Israel deal  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City Zone J of Energy Line Losses Ancillarys and ICAP  The TD is a pass through  We only tested one site out of the ten  Needless to say this is probably one of the simplest structures available  Obviously we have worked on a few other things at the same time so it has taken longer than we expected but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in its current state Quick statistics for ONE site Each month of hourly data takes 5-6 minutes to save  We booked 100 months approx 83 years therefore each deal type energy ancillary etc took 8-9 hours to book Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy ancillarys only 1 line losses and ICAP this is not booked hourly therefore it only takes 1 hour to book Although we booked only one ancillary position most markets have at least four therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours Once we got a book to run it took 25 minutes to calculate the value All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals Recommendations Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management valuation reporting scheduling settlements accounting etc In the interim Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting  As well create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift reg switch options and new deals Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting East desk does not currently have an intramonth book Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting  Currently this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components as opposed to current bundled curves Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower  Position and PL reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS Here is a breakdown of what it took to rebook this trade Week 1 May 14-18 Read Contract Get Batch model as well as a breakdown of value between Energy Ancillarys etc Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model in Excel to check valuation Week 2 May 21-25 Continue working on Full Requirements model Work with Risk Management Stacey Whites group to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect   We had gotten about 13 of the deal booked by the time we realized this At times the database tables would run out of space because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database  This would keep us from entering any new data Week 3 May 29-June 1 Finished Excel Full Requirements model  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP  The current ICAP curves are            MW-day and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days ie June and July have the same MWday price even though there are 30 and 31 days respectively in each month  This can be fixed in the curve files  In the future we should mark the curves as Kw-month Again we ran into problems with the test database Completed booking in Enpower Week 4 June 4-5 Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation portcalc to work Discovered deal entry errors in booking
