Have you spoke to Greg Whalley about Kristen Albrecht, Dierdra McCaffery, Jim Brysch, and Heather Kendall.   We need to move forward on putting these teams together, and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 6-9 months.

I would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals.

Thanks.

Kevin,

Who now handles Duke's system territory with King switching to ERCOT?  You or Fletch?

North Carolina Mun. Power Agency 1 has informally requested up to 100MW of capacity and energy for May-Sep'02 with a "relatively high" strike price (probably $100) into Duke, or regulatory capacity.

Formally, they have issued 2 RFP's:  1) to buy as much as 750MW of intermediate, peaking, and reserve capacity for summer peak months of 2003 and beyond (1-5 years), increasing by approx. 25MW per year; 2) to sell up to eight, 50MW blocks of 7x24 energy, system firm or unit contingent, off of Catawba and/or McGuire nuclear plants, interconnected with the Duke trans. system, beginning 1/1/03 (1-8 year term).

Subject:	FW: Tariff Strategy Meeting

FYI - 

My position is as follows:

I am trying to narrow the focus on our curve review and maintenance to JUST areas where we have existing positions and possibly areas that are in or near full dereg stages (NE, IL, TX, OH).  Currently URM is responsible for virtually every curve and thus knows very little about a whole lot.  The proposed reduction would help URM focus on what is important and allow them to "get it right".

I do not think it is necessary nor is it appropriate to offer bundled products until we can determine effective ways to reduce our existing exposure.  I do think we can stand ready to adjust this strategy if necessary and on a case by case basis.

I do think we can offer shaped, staggered maturity wholesale products to generally hedge customers in regulated states against directional price movements. I am absolutely against offering anything that looks like the traditional Retail Index Product.

I expect to get a little push back on this approach and also think I will hear that it is necessary to offer bundled products to support DSM.  As I said in my last tariff strategy meeting, I would be glad to give URM to Ozzie too.  I will be a much better bid for DSM related T/D positions as offsets to current positions.

Rogers

Subject:	Estate Fundamentals 


Lloyd and Tim H,   There is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the Enron Estate.  To date, our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems (data harvesting, portals, metastock, decision support cubes, etc...) would only be operational in NetCo.  There is no IT staffing in estate to support fundamentals.

Beth Perlman told me today that Jim Fallon has indicated that we need to have IT people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the East and West Desks.

A few questions...  Do you agree?  If so, I can have our East Desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate IT personnel.  I'll work with Beth on candidates.  Can this requirement be met for West Desk fundamentals?  If so, how would we proceed?  Who would be involved?

Thanks,  Steve

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

FYI.  Oglethorpe (OPC) is inquiring about buying some daily calls for next May-Jul.  I'm already working with Harry/Steve, but thought you would like the reason for the request.  OPC is building a 440MW merchant plant scheduled to be online in June'02.  OPC is looking to buy these calls to hedge against a late online date (suggesting they have already sold at least some of this planned new generation).

I lost $2 million in new deal P&L putting the spread on because they have their curves so srewed up.   With respect to your question, I think the answer is yes because I can sell 02 on-line by controlling the stack (limit orders) and the coal group will sell 03-04 at $35/ton.   I now own this at $32 because they mis-mark their curve in 04 by $4.00/ton (ie negative $2 million in new deal P&L.)

The bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on.

Good info.   Consistent with reports from McGowan.   I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.   Love the spread given my view of natty.

Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call Alan.   You are certainly free to call him if you want.

Rob Kelter and Julie Lucas from Citizen's Utility Board (CUB) a residential=
 advocacy group in Illinois called me yesterday to discuss Enron's interest=
 in becoming a provider of last resort for Illinois residential customers s=
erved by ComEd.  As a result of the letter that ComEd sent to the ICC regar=
ding the PPO, etc, CUB has met with ComEd regarding the impact on residenti=
al customers.  ComEd has told CUB that they do not want to be the provider =
of last resort and also that their plan is to raise the residential rate hi=
gh enough to incentivize marketers to come and serve, a plan which is anath=
ema to CUB.

The bottom line is that CUB is either looking to pass legislation for munic=
ipal aggregation like Ohio or work out a deal with a supplier to be the POL=
R and take it to ComEd.  (While I don't know this for sure, I suspect we ar=
e the only marketer they have talked to since we were the only ones to expr=
ess an interest in talking further).  If that doesn't work, they want to fo=
rce ComEd into doing least cost planning for its supply.

Rob did not know what the unbundled generation rate is but said the all-in =
rate is approximately $.09/kwh.  Subtracting out t&d we could be looking at=
 a generation price to beat of approximately $.06/kwh. We would also need t=
o factor in the impact of any increase as a result of the DST case because =
under their filing, the rate increase applies only to customers who switch.=
  As part of any deal, we could argue to ComEd that the customers we take o=
n should be treated like bundled customers).  I have asked Marc Ulrich and =
Guy Sharfman for specifics as to the size of the residential load and the u=
nbundled generation rate.

The questions we need to discuss internally include:

1. Is this a deal we could do from a physical delivery standpoint?
2.  If yes, would we want to take on the entire residential load or just a =
portion, for example the residential customers of the City of Chicago).
3.  Is this an EES deal or is this an ENA deal in which we bring in New Pow=
er? =20

Your comments and thoughts would be appreciated.  At any rate this will be =
on the agenda for our ComEd strategy meeting on August 6 - see other emails=
.  Rob and I agreed to get back in touch the week of August 19th to discuss=
 further.

I have been told that all control area agreements have lapsed and are no lo=
nger in effect.  Per David Portz, there are still in existence memberships =
with regional authorities (you pay dues and you get to vote) which he says =
will lapse when the regional authorities determine that Enron no longer con=
trols any load.  Also, there are items of software and hardware used by Enr=
on-SE Corp., which would be transferred to Netco.  I do not think that the =
hardware and software is owned by Enron-SE, since purportedly the only asse=
t showing on the books of Enron-SE is a receivable of $1,218 from ENA.  The=
 software and hardware was purchased from ESCA and $1.5 million is still ow=
ed.  David Portz thought that EPMI or ENA actually purchased the hardware a=
nd software (and I think probably still owns it).  I am attempting to ascer=
tain ownership from accounting.  Based on these facts, it does not appear t=
hat there is any great benefit to the estate in keeping the hardware and so=
ftware.  Further, the outstanding payable of $1.5 could be transferred to N=

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

Kevin -

Just got off the phone with Jackie Thomas at Relaint.  I worked with Jackie many years ago and I think he runs their power trading desk.  Anyway, he said he has had heartburn with the way EOL notifies users of contract/confirm changes.  EOL puts up a banner notifying the user of the change but he claims that if the user does not log on for several days then the banner may not appear, yet the contract change has been implemented.  Jackie cited the specific instance of the ERCOT 138 kv delivery requirement as an example of a change that apparently "slipped by".  Jackie feels that either the banner should stay active on a user by user basis until that user logs in and acknowledges it or a notice should be sent to a legal contact at the company - preferably both.  He does not feel as though our legal group appreciates his concern and their legal group is recommending that they halt trading on EOL unless some safeguards are implemented - he does not want to do this.

I am not sure if the situation he described is accurate, but I did want this info to be conveyed and I think someone from EOL should call him to discuss.  Jackie's number is 713-2071308.  I would be glad to continue to facilitate discussions if necessary.

Thanks,
Rogers

I am shaking off the rust from my vacation, and so are my banking friends.
It will probably take until next week to get a decent cross-section from the
financial/development segments, but you have put your fingers on the key.
Who will start construction with 02 and 03 in the mid-$30's? Probably more
than a few is my guess.

The July 2001 Edition of "Smart" Money had a section on energy. The cover
read: "Power Up Your Portfolio .. 10 Great Energy Stocks And Funds To Buy
Now".
STOCKS
1. Apache
2. Dominion
3. Dynegy (your favorite)
4. Mirant
5. Noble Drilling
6. Quanta Services
FUNDS
7. Strong American Utilities
8. Vanguard Utilities Income
9. Invesco Energy
10.Strong Energy

On one page, there was this message overlayed on top of two transmission
towers:
"With fundamentals as strong as they are, there will never be a "last time"
to buy these stocks."

"You've Got To Love Dynegy." "You can snap up the Houston-based Dynegy for
just 21 times earnings - not bad for a leading energy marketer that's also
one of the fastest-growing independent power producers in the U.S., with
17,775 megawatts operating in high-growth, high-demand regions such as the
midwest, northeast, southeast, and California". They were comparing Dynegy
to Calpine (in terms of PEs) but were saying tha Dynegy had the trading too
so they were a better bet (UGH)!

The wild card is dumb investors and lenders. Still too much money chasing
too few quality cash generators.

I have given some further thought to the gas story, and I agree that the
odds are low of any sort of meaningful bounce in price from today's levels.
We are really quite certain that gas inventory will get mighty fat, and that
the fronts will have to give way to create storage room for gas. This is the
same ugly story I was putting forth when I saw you a few months back. While
in theory coal could lose market to gas and heavy industry could restart
(both being positive demand surprises), I agree that the odds of these are
low ... but I will keep watching and testing notwithstanding. While are not
expecting it this early, the combination of the above and a sharp
contraction in gas oriented drilling could provide some support for prices.
Again, for the time being it certainly looks like it is pleasant to be a
bear. Give some thought to buying some of that mid-$30 energy for your
end-users (2002/3) or don't they make deals that far out?

It is hard to see much upside risk to power without some odd weather
wildcards or something funky on coal. Stock levels have remained low, but
are building. We also have yet to see a really hot day this month. Before we
bury this beast, I want to check its pulse one more time. Ontario set a new
summer peak this past month. I gather the dash for gas stopped.

BEWARE OF HILLARY & SCHUMER: Spoke with FERC late on Tuesday. One more pop
in NY and there may be a California style mitigation scheme put in place in
New York according to my contact there.

I hope your 4th was enjoyable.

Thanks for the call the other day.

The deal structure was initially all on peak, but migrated to 55/45 on/off peak.  That was the split at which the desk wanted all of these deals structured.  This was the intent of the deal at contract signing.  The contract does not reflect this intent adequately.  This has been known and discussed for some time - almost 2 years.  But, reorgs and departures have apparently left it unfixed all this time.  The last I knew John Wack was working to fix this over a year ago.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Edith and the group are working on OC contract review-rebooking.  We have a serious question about intent vs. what is explicitly stated in the contract.  As I understand it, you might have been the deal lead on this one.  Just want your honest opinion on this one and we will proceed based on that.

Berney -

I think that we need to go with 

> 1 million Mwh = Presto 
> 2 million Mwh = Lavo 

This may still be too restrictive and burdensome on Lavo and Presto.

Kevin - what do you think?

I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already Director level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.   Please talk to Doug directly on the justification.

Kevin,

The actual numbers are $2.9 for LCRA and 2.09 for Green Mountain. The LCRA number was for the transmission spread to Austin and can be released as we have Sandhill and the transmission market is no longer set up as it was in Sept 2000. On the Green Mountain side, $950 K is for scalar risk which may be high, $1 MM for ancillaries and $150 for the QSE exposure I underwrote for the services desk.

I feel comfortable releasing the LCRA and a portion of the Green Mountain scalar and a/s reserves. We have some idea of the a/s risk now but I need to keep some of that in reserve. Obviously the QSE part I need to keep.

Let me know,

Doug

Please get a $ amount from Deffner's group on the collateral cost issue.  Given the shape of the loan, Enron will have to post significant collateral on the 03 & 04 positions, and I need a PV cost associated with collateral requirements of this loan package.  Please talk with Bradford with respect to credit $'s.

Kevin,

This is really not a credit issue.  Since the position will be balanced, our exposure is really only the MTM on the position which will grow negative as they fund us.  Therefore there should be no credit reserve charge except for the MTM gains.  I will need a valuation model to calculate.

Posting collateral is somewhat more troubling given our current margin postion ($350mm to Duke). You should talk with Joe Deffner regarding the impact on our liquidity and the proper funding rate for Enron's balance sheet.  I thought the number was 15% but that's Joe's call.

Bill

Duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption.   They have indicated that creates "accounting issues" for there accrual book.

Therefore, I need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows.  In rough numbers, we receive $200 million in the first two years and return $250 million in the last two years.

Because of this, in years 03 and 04, our collateral posting will be significant.

Let me know your thoughts ASAP on Monday morning.

I know we spoke about this few weeks back and you were realtively pessimistic about it.  However, it is my understanding that they have secured financing and so are now interested in seeing "tolling" bids for the output/optionality offered by this technology.   I assume you'd be relatively more interested in a tolling bid than actually providing capital.
 
I am overnighting to you a presentation they made at a bidders conference in Houston.  Also, attached below is a Q&A relating to the project.   I am on vacation Tues and Weds (and unfortunately unreachable -- fishing on a lake in NH ouside cell/pager range).  If you have an interest, perhaps you can pass along to Oscar Dalton or someone covering the ECAR region to pursue further.
 
I'll be checking my voicemails late afternoons tues and weds, so please leave me a msg if you want me to follow this up.

Lloyd,

The Enron Hedge Fund team in the NY office is interested in marketing power (energy only right now) to the hedge funds that we are already marketing nat. gas, crude oil, products, etc... to.  Our team has a very solid working relationship with the fundamentals groups in gas and crude&products.  As I will be directly responsible for marketing power to the funds, I would like to develop that same level of relationship with the power fundamentals group.  As a middle marketer, I will always be talking to Enron's power traders first before giving a quote out to any of the funds on a transaction.  I look forward to hearing back from you and Rika in regards to this initiative.

Regards,

FYI - 

My position is as follows:

I am trying to narrow the focus on our curve review and maintenance to JUST areas where we have existing positions and possibly areas that are in or near full dereg stages (NE, IL, TX, OH).  Currently URM is responsible for virtually every curve and thus knows very little about a whole lot.  The proposed reduction would help URM focus on what is important and allow them to "get it right".

I do not think it is necessary nor is it appropriate to offer bundled products until we can determine effective ways to reduce our existing exposure.  I do think we can stand ready to adjust this strategy if necessary and on a case by case basis.

I do think we can offer shaped, staggered maturity wholesale products to generally hedge customers in regulated states against directional price movements. I am absolutely against offering anything that looks like the traditional Retail Index Product.

I expect to get a little push back on this approach and also think I will hear that it is necessary to offer bundled products to support DSM.  As I said in my last tariff strategy meeting, I would be glad to give URM to Ozzie too.  I will be a much better bid for DSM related T/D positions as offsets to current positions.

Fine with me on the pools.  In the west we named a marketer, a cash trader and an attorney to coordinate on each transmission company.  Case by case, those three will determine the "primary point of contact" and the best way to get it done quickly.

Subject:	Lead Contact for Power Pool and Transmission Service Agreements

After our recent Re-start meeting and the associated planning, there has been significant e-mail activity about what appears to be different points of contact into the different Pools and Transmission Providers.

I would recommend that Netco anoint a Primary Point of Contact with each Pool and Transmission Provider and that person have the resources of Legal, Govt Affairs, Commercial, Credit, etc.  The Primary Point of Contact would initiate and lead all discussions with the counterparty to expedite the agreement.

For the Pools, I think that Govt Affairs should be the Primary Point of Contact.

ISO-NE 	=	Christi Nicolay
NY-ISO		=	Christi Nicolay
PJM		=	Jim Steffes
ERCOT		=	Charles Yeung
MISO		=	Sarah Novosel
SPP		=	Christi Nicolay
CAISO		=	Alan Comnes (although Steve Hall is already working on this and should not be displaced).

For the individual Transmission Providers, I think that the Real-Time Desk/Logistics should be the Primary Point of Contact.

Does anyone see any issues with this proposal?  I am concerned that Netco may be taking multiple positions with the same provider and that could lead to delay.

Thanks.

Please make a recommendation that keeps this individual.   I have given my views, and they are falling on deaf ears.   Please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 75-80k.   This seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult.

After forwarding your request for a employment agreement renewal for Dean Laurent to Oxley, he brought forward the following points.  It seems the suggestion is that the proposed raise is too much in one go.  Perhaps we could go with a figure I mentioned in an earlier email say 55k.  It is also suggested that we forgo a  "contract" and substitute a  90 day evergreen no-compete instead. I think the sentiment would be to avoid contracts for folks below the level of manager when possible.  I think the thought process is to put a desirable package in front of the candidate that commits them to the organization utilizing another tool.

Kevin,

I am now a member of the Enron team.  I accepted the offer for
42,500.  The 10% shift differential is still there and I am
waiting to hear about moving expenses.  Thanks for getting me in
the door.  It is now time for me to kick it in the ass and
determine my future with Enron.

I think you forgot the cash postion.  I would rather have on-line valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.   I like to look at my personal equity portfolio (includes Enron hedging) separate from Enron granted stock and option value.   

One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently.

   Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.
   The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market
   value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get
   total
   portfolio value.

   I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate.

      That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the
      Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the cost
      basis)
      represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does that

      The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated
      based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the
      market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is
      valued OK, but the options are not.

      In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in
      the portfolio.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.

I am still not pleased with the information display on the cubes.  It is way too difficult to view daily information and move from month to month to observe historical heat rate liquidations and $/Mwh price liquidations.   The tables on the top need to have dates and summary info.

Please assemble a project team to make the data more user friendly.

A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.

We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.

Are you guys in?   We will have a blast.

I agree with Rogers.   Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market, it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs.   At that point, both entities will assume separate responsibility.

Subject:	Curve Marks thru 2/4 (maybe 2/5)

Kevin/Paul -

Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4.  Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time.

Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases).  My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed.  At that time, there will be two separate processes.  The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions.

In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes.  We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods.

Please let me know if you agree.

Rogers

Marc Ulrich - URM - He is the commercial expert on ComEd and rate effects on our business - Mandatory
Jeff Merola - Manager of Physical Delivery Logistics for Central Region - mandatory
Brad Snyder - Structured supply 
Mark Bernstein - Structured Supply
Jeff Ader - Structured Supply
Janine Migden - Regulatory
Roy Boston - Regulatory
RogersHerndon - EWS Risk
Name I forgot - Legal - Ulrich recomended he go given the ComEd audience

This would be 9.  I think this is too much.  What are your thoughts?  

Given the agenda items of 1) ComEd PPO phase-out intentions, 2) Physical Delivery Issues and 3) Potential Business Transactions b/w ComEd and Enron, I think we need to trim the list of attendees.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.

I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.   This is pretty easy math for me.

I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.   I would like to get this done ASAP.

Thanks.

Subject:	Mark  Dean Laurent follow up
Sensitivity:	Confidential

I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent.  Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following:


Current Salary: $47,500
Job Group:  Specialist
YE PRC Rating:  Satisfactory

Original Proposition:

Base Salary 65k
1 Year Agreement
$5,000 signing


Revised Proposal:

Base Salary:  55k
1 Year agreement
$5,000 signing
Business Case:  If we offered Dean 55k or  60k it would still constitute a over a $10,000 increase (approximately 25%) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level.  Also, the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66k. It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted. Secondly, he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg. Paul Thomas, Jason Choate, Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai.

Salary Listing in Job Group:

Maria Valdes   superior    $62,500
Paul Thomas   excellent   $55,008
Jason Choate  excellent   $60,008
Todd DeCook   strong      $42,008 
Peter Makkai   strong      $47,500

Let me know your thoughts....then I will run it by Oxley.

Yes it is irrelevant.   Now that we have competent risk managers making the decision, they will know how to effectively hedge these deals.   Furthermore, pricing is always available on demand.   When each trader has 30-40 products to manage in a volatile market, they are not necessarily going to put 03-10 for peak and off-peak in every region.

It becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently.

Please begin scrubbing the 02 and 03 new gen book again given the current situation in the energy market.   I would like a new forecast in 30 days if possible.

In addition, I would like begin running the unit commitment model (dispatch) and "knock" the cob webs off everyone.   Let's plan on having a meeting to go over what the new daily reports were going to look like - wasn't Gus working on this?   

What is the status of the transmission modeling?

Can we integrate the system dispatch and LMP simulation models?

It needs to look like our wholesale reports (postions shown behind each utility).   In addition, peak and off-peak should be on separate pages.   We should have two views:

	1) By utility
	2) By counterparty

Kevin-

I agree; the format on the management reports leaves much to be desired.  

I have recently inherited the task of assembling and distributing the report.  As such I have decided to clean it up, and I have several ideas.

An outside opinion would be helpful so that I am am able to make the information which you need accessible.  As I know you agree with me that the format is poor I would appreciate some suggestions so that I can make the report better suit your's and others' needs.

Feel free to call me x.54282 (I'll be here until at least 6) or you can e-mail me.

I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling.   It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region.   Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation.

Maps and graphs are very useful.   The presentation should be very macro in scope.

I would work with Gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar.

They have begun construction for a couple of CT's (at least they have poured the concrete slab).  However, the 440MW is incorrect (I had pulled this from a list provided by Fundamentals).  It's closer to 200MW (per OPC).

FYI.  Oglethorpe (OPC) is inquiring about buying some daily calls for next May-Jul.  I'm already working with Harry/Steve, but thought you would like the reason for the request.  OPC is building a 440MW merchant plant scheduled to be online in June'02.  OPC is looking to buy these calls to hedge against a late online date (suggesting they have already sold at least some of this planned new generation).

Ok

I will work with the following assumptions:

Lateral move (title)
Salary (same as London converted to dollars?)
Start date: middle of November

Since I have not done one of these before, let me know if I am missing something.

Thanks.

Kevin,

We have not met personnally however I was in the meeting a couple of weeks
ago where Accenture, Lloyd Will and Steve Nat presented recommendations
related to building systems capability to support East Desk trading growth.

I spoke to Lloyd today regarding his approach below for obtaining
additional business ownership associated with that plan. I wanted to see if
you had any specific business personnel in mind to be involved in this
process. If so, I wanted to pass that onto my guys to make sure they were
focused on getting the right people involved in the process.

Thanks for your input,

Phil Crosby

      Assessment


I'm on the road and will not be available until next Tuesday at the
earliest.

For us to finish this work we need to have the front line customers in a
room for a day or two and review your initial findings.  So far accenture
has done all of the work with each of us in isolation and this has lead to
us being further apart rather than leaving us with a common vision to start
from.

I do not feel that accenture is ready for Kevin at this point however his
number is 713-853-5035 if you want to call him after 3:00 but I believe he
is out this Friday.  I'm available by cell at 713-806-6294 if you want to
discuss.

For both tracks below Enron needs to create our team that will own and
drive this work and this will take a little time as indicated in the
meeting.  What we need is for accenture to finish the initial evaluation
and work with us on the possible solutions and the effort required.  Once
this is done an Enron team will be able to review the report and costs to
complete our own evaluation.

The recommendations on what we do next will be coming from an Enron team.
For these projects to be successful we need to have customer commitment or
they will fail.

This was the initial intent of bring you in no more no less.

   Subject:  Accenture Plan to Refine Competitive Markets Trading
             Assessment

   All,

   Attached is a little more detail around the approach to refine the
   program
   plan associated with the Competitive Market Trading Assessment work.
   Please take a look and let me know if you have comments. I would like to
   begin execution of the plan next Monday when Mani Vadari and Mike
   Templin
   are in Houston.

   Essentially there are two tracks.

   1. Near Term Program Development - The first track involves reviewing
   the
   initial recommendations developed over the past weeks with the business
   and
   also confirming the near term capabilities/projects which they believe
   we
   need to focus on. The main objective here is to make sure we are in
   sync.
   with the near term business needs and are able to link the projects very
   specifically to those needs. I also want to make sure that the business
   buys into the initial recommendations and is able to articulate the
   benefits. If they don't we probably need to refine the recommendations.

   2. Confirm Longer Term Program - The second track is to reconcile the
   the
   longer term plan developed by the team with the near term priorities
   defined in Step 1, as well as break the longer term initiatives into
   more
   incremental components. I also wanted Mike Templin to investigate in
   more
   detail how the incremental EnPower Trading architecture migration would
   work (per Madhup's healthy scepticism).

   Lloyd, I wanted to make sure that Kevin is on board with this approach.
   Is
   it possible to set up a meeting tomorrow (Friday) with him to discuss
   his
   perspective?

   Regards

   Phil Crosby

I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.   Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.   With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.

Last July, the VA SCC submitted an application to view EOL.  They were declined by credit as they had no intention to trade.

It is Virginia's hope to use EOL as a price basis when establishing the forward market price within tariffs for utilities and other suppliers to a new emerging deregulated market.

I'm asking that this application be re-reviewed and that they be given read only access.  Three years would be most helpful as they'll be conducting this program to set pricing through 2004, possibly cal05.

Thank you,

   Kevin

   Today at the Commercial Practices Committee (SPP) we voted to accept the
   draft real time market design for the "Day 2" market (i.e. 12/15/02).
   This design, while not perfect, is in the direction of PJM.  As such it
   provides a real time market (yes you will be able to go long/short
   10,000MW in real time!), with no penalties and no balanced schedule
   requirement.  Although control areas will be maintained, SPP will be the
   central dispatcher (the role of the control areas as of 12/15/02 has yet
   to be determined).  Moreover, the SPP real time market will probably be
   implemented by MISO and is being looked at by GridSouth.  Overall this
   is a pretty good outcome for both Enron and the market in general.

   On a different note,  I provided Jim Steffes with my letter of
   resignation today.  I don't know whether or not I will be back in the
   office so I wanted to express what a pleasure it has been to work with
   (for?) you and the desk - I am very grateful for the confidence that you
   have shown in me.  My biggest regret is that the market design function
   didn't reside within your area of management rather than under
   government affairs.

   If I can ever be of any help please don't hesitate to contact me.

   Kind regards, Ron

Also,  I am concerned that Narsimha may have someone from the outside trying to recruit him.  I am pressing him on the contract and he is telling me everything's ok - lawyer reviewing, etc.  I am going to give him another day or so and then just call him on it.  I think there is better money out there, even in this market and do not want to lose him.  Honestly, Joe, Juan and Narsimha are the only commodity guys I can count on to do what is right - amazing.  You may want to ask Narsimha about the contract if you see him.

I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.

thanks.

I think it is appropriate to instruct Risk to put the charges associated with the PJM scalar in the Change Deal Bucket as this was out of the Retail Commodity Group's control.  I am trying to hold these guys accountable for positions, p/l and such and I think this is the only way to fairly account for results that they could affect vs. someone else's error/mismark.  Let me know if you think this is appropriate.

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

Kevin,

Greg Krause asked me what the desk thought of 90 MW of LM6000 generation in Homestead FL. I told him that the transmission looked very favorable for 90 MW (w/o other generation added in the area). What do you think about having the generation there from the commodity perspective?

Just so you see how others value GTC,  Dyn (Tamplen) is offered for 5x16, Cal'02 - '03 @ $2.50 above your SOCO offer.  Last we spoke about this, your bid was $0.60 over SOCO mid (approx. $0.35 over SOCO offer)--we're over $2 apart.  He's working on his bid for into GTC.

Regarding: energy trading positions 
 
To Kevin Presto, Harry Arora, and John Arnold:
 
I am writing to you to express my desire to be apart of the Wholesale Power and Gas Trading operation that will potentially be created with an entity that has a high credit rating.  I have been working for Rogers Herndon in Enron Wholesale Services on the Options Desk.  In this role I have modeled the power options that are embedded in the various deals done through Enron Energy Services with large industrial and commercial clients.  In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators.  I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons:
 
?         Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits
?         Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk
?         Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking 
?         Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States
?         Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid
?         Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM
?         Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility
?         Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products
?         Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy
?         Strength in mentoring junior traders
 
Thank you,

Ryan is waffling.  I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.   These weather guys need physcology treatement.   Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.   I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.
 
Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.   With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

I realize real estate around you is pricey, but do you think I can secure a spot on the power trading floor for someone in RAC?  It would be great to have an opportunity to get better plugged into the power floor.

I read the proposal last night, and although it is not perfect, it is a big=
 improvement over what we have today.   Therefore, I (and my team) support =
Enron's endorsement of the PJM Proposal (with your timeline condition).

Thanks for all your good work.

Subject:=09RE: Support of PJM's Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO

Kevin:

I think the PJM proposal looks pretty good as a first step.  As we discusse=
d in Houston, the proposal gives us a single day-ahead and real time energy=
 market for the entire Northeast, but it does not get us everything at firs=
t.  For example, on Day One, PJM proposes to retain the 4 existing control =
areas and allow the individual control areas to redispatch in the real time=
 market for local transmission constraints.  This could result in New York =
continuing to manipulate the market in an attempt to keep prices down, but =
as we discussed in Houston (and as Andy Ott has confirmed), it is highly un=
likely that PJM will allow New York to continue this type of market interfe=
rence once PJM is in charge and running the market.  Also, by leaving some =
of the existing systems in place, PJM has aptly responded to the New York a=
rgument that "local reliability" in New York must be maintained, so that Ne=
w York's opposition is seen for what it is -- an attempt to delay indefinit=
ely an RTO in the Northeast.

Enron's support of the PJM proposal would be very helpful in mediation sinc=
e we are seen as a big player in the region and because the other two propo=
sals on the table are sponsored by the New York TOs and the New York ISO an=
d envision a new RTO system based on the PJM "Platform" changed by as-yet u=
ndefined "Best Practices" from the other two ISOs (and New York has indicat=
ed it thinks a lot of its market design is a "best practice"), and these ot=
her options will not begin operation for 3-5 years at best.

Nevertheless, even though we here in Washington think the PJM proposal look=
s good, it is important that you and your team are also comfortable with it=
.  If you all have not had an opportunity to review the proposal to ensure =
that you are satisfied with it, then I would propose that we not sign Enron=
's name onto the proposal.  We can talk about the proposal in more detail a=
nd even have Andy Ott available for a conference call or a trip to Houston =
to answer any questions you may have.  If you need more time, then I think =
we should follow this route instead, even if it means we cannot lend our su=
pport for PJM at this time.

Please let me know what you think.

Sarah

Subject:=09Support of PJM's Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO

As I mentioned to each of you today, we plan to sign Enron's name as a memb=
er of the "One RTO Coalition" in support of PJM's proposal for developing a=
 single Norhteast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market i=
n the Northeast.  PJM's proposal is attached.  As you may recall, I gave yo=
u a copy of PJM's proposal and we discussed it when I was in Houston a coup=
le of weeks ago.  The main concern with PJM's proposal is its timing -- the=
ir time line provides for an implementation date of November 2003.  We have=
 talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation =
process, and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively, but they are unwi=
lling to change their target date in their proposal.

Because we disagree with the PJM date, we propose to have Enron Power Marke=
ting, Inc.'s name included on the list of supporters of the proposal, with =
the following footnote:

=09While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance =
of PJM's proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein, =
Enron =09Power Marketing, Inc. dissents from PJM's date of November 2003 fo=
r implementing the single RTO in the Northeast.  Enron believes that the PJ=
M proposal =09can and must be implemented by December 2002 and that extensi=
on of the implementation date past December 2002 is unnecessary and contrar=
y to the =09Commission's RTO policy established in Order No. 2000.

This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJM's timing in comm=
ents to the Commission after the Judge submits his report (due on September=
 17).  In those comments we can go into much greater detail about the need =
for quick implementation.

Please let me know if you have any suggested changes to the footnote or if =
you disagree with our proposed strategy.  We will address this issue on Thu=
rsday at mediation (I thought it was going to come up today, which is why I=
 called each of you), so if you have any comments or concerns, please let m=
e know as soon as possible.=20

Thanks

EPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP (Installed Capability) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo.   The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation (Paul Posoli and Kevin Presto) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit.

The parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language, at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Kevin,
 
I got your message  today regarding the invoices that you have received for tickets.  I am  sorry I didn't have a chance to call you back.
 
The only invoices  that you should have received recently are for the 6 Washington tickets and the  SVIP parking pass.  I faxed these to you about a week  ago.
 
As part of your  membership at the Golden Cane level, you are entitled to 4 complimentary season  tickets.  Based on your conversation with Patrick, these are going to be  located in the section in front of the press box reserved for Golden Canes and  Living Scholars.  Your parking pass and any additional season, home or away  game tickets would need to be purchased.
 
Please let me know  if you have any additional questions or concerns.  Thank you, once again,  for continued support of the Hurricane Club.

We have made great returns on the front of the curve and the back of the curve.   We have significant Cal 02 through Cal 05 positions, that have provided solid profitability.

It is completely inaccurate to say we have made all of our money on the front of the curve.

Kevin,
In addition to getting back with me regarding the main power risk facing Enron,  I get the impression that recently the East desk is making most of its money in the front of the curve.  My point is, I will be discussing with Lavo trader performance reports, and I think an important insight is whether or not a trader/desk is historically great at making money in the front or back of the curve?  In your opinion, what part of the curve are you "masters" at, and are there any Enron resources that could be better deployed improving those areas?

Additional ideas would be to somehow "flag" that we have large positions concentrated in an area of the curve where we historically are non-performers..  This perhaps could trigger additional fundamental analysis, maybe we could set up a limit structure around these areas?

Don't know if this is good, bad or nonproductive idea..

Your feedback would be appreciated.

Frank

I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.

He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.

Kevin,

This is to inform you that I am very excited about an opportunity to join your team.  However, I am not excited about the position I've been offered.  I understand you are working on the economics, but I also want you to know that I am not overly interested in Hourly.  I feel my experience and skill-sets are up for a bigger challenge.  Truthfully, I am interested in a position that will lead into a cash trading position in the future.  I don't see Hourly doing that for me.

Let us talk at your convenience.  Thanks.

Could you take a crack at a draft for the Skilling/Lay presentation.   The presentation should focus on supply/demand (97-02), RTO progess in each region, and the progression of heat rate curves (expanded last year and compressing this year), pricing history, volatility graphs, etc.

Thanks.

Can you guys start putting a high level presentation together for your region for a presentation to Lay and Skilling.  I'll try to set up the date or dates but can you guys send me something tentative by next Wednesday.  Touching on the past and how its changed vs current and forward would be a good way of looking at it.

Liz can you try to set up a date 2 weeks from now with Skilling and Lay.  Tim were you going to be in Houston this month.  If so it might be easier to do it then.

Duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption.   They have indicated that creates "accounting issues" for there accrual book.

Therefore, I need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows.  In rough numbers, we receive $200 million in the first two years and return $250 million in the last two years.

Because of this, in years 03 and 04, our collateral posting will be significant.

Let me know your thoughts ASAP on Monday morning.

We need to have everything in 30 days.  I know that.

The question is given everything else - FERC MBR, gas pipelines, PJM, etc. - isn't it better to move into ERCOT at the wholesale level and then come back after getting the rest of the market moving along?

From a resource standpoint, I need to understand how to get PUCT counsel for UBS to start the REP process anyway.

I currently work for Paul Racicot and support his trading organization in the areas of logistics and operations.  Paul asked me to send you a copy of my resume.  I am interested in meeting with you to learn more about Enron's power trading business and to discuss employment opportunities in ENA.

Enclosed in my resume.  I look forward to talking with you.

This transaction was never in the trading books and all P&L and decision-making was within the origination group.   I may have recommended that Ozzie buy the balance of year coal, however, all $ impacts and decisions were within the control of orig/corp development.

Therefore, Heather, Ozzie and Don Miller are the parties that must deal with any of the contractual issues and intra-company monetary issues.

Subject:	NC Power Holdings deal

Ozzie and Heather,

In February time frame EGM Coal desk sold firm delivered coal to NC Power Holdings balance of year (2001) for $72/ton.  We also did a requirements deal beyond this point.  My understanding was Ozzie made the balance of the year trade per Kevin Presto.  Ozzie also verified this understanding in a phone conversation with me a couple of weeks back.  NC Power Holdings is currently not taking any coal on there take or pay obligation.  

There is liquidated damages associated with this transaction which need to be settled.  It will also be prudent to determine if the remaining tonnage obligation for balance of the year needs to be settled now or in the future.

Please let me know who is specifically responsible to settle this trade.

KJM

Kevin -
 
I have prepared the following reviews for mid year:
Zurita
Decker
Wagner
Makkai
Ochsner
 
The following are still outstanding:
Acevedo, Rudy
Carson, Mike
Forney, John
Garcia, Miguel
Laurent, Mark Dean
Hernandez, Juan
 
As for Rudy, Dean and Miguel, I think Juan and Lloyd/Kayne are in the best situation to at least provide comments on these individuals.  I will be glad to prepare and have no problem doing so by the end of the week.  If you agree, we can forward to Juan and I will coordinate.
 
Re: Carson and Forney, Juan Hernandez - what do you suggest on these?  I can go either way with these - let me know.  I can easily do them, I just need some mid-year facts and recent obeservations.

Everyone- 

I will be out of town until Friday (will be in office Friday mid-morning) and then we will be in Belize from the 6th to the 13th.  

We will be staying at: 

VICTORIA HOUSE RESORT 
P.O. Box 22 
Ambergris Caye, Belize 
Central America 
Tel: 501-262067 
Fax: 501-262429 

The best way to reach me is probably via my home e-mail (drherndon@aol.com) I will be checking this via internet cafe at least twice a day.  Feel free to call the hotel and leave a message as well.  I will try to check my enron e-mail if i can from Belize.

Have a great New Year and see you briefly on Friday the 4th.

Terry,

Please set aside 30 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to Su=
zette.   I don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be a=
ppreciated.   Please coordinate with TJ Black (3-5800).

My conversations with Chris have been along the same lines - Personally the=
 modeling thing is a very minor concern to me.  That is only one component =
of what we are doing and, based upon what I have heard about Chris, he will=
 be able to pick it up quickly.  Obviously his mind is on other things righ=
t now but I am very comfortable that he would be able to add value to our e=
ffort.

In Suzette's case, again she obviously wants to develop her skill set but I=
 think she would be a good fit.  Tim, I agree with your point that Kevin mi=
ght be the right person to follow-up with her.

I spoke to Chris Ahn last Friday.  He left for his wedding and honeymoon on=
 Monday or Tuesday of this week.  He has two concerns.  The first is that h=
e doesn't want to flake on east power structuring.  I told him that Presto =
should be able to smooth that over.  The second one is that he isn't sure t=
hat he has yet developed the modeling skills that are necessary for this ty=
pe of heavy lifting.  He is smart and hardworking, but I personally haven't=
 witnessed his modeling skills nor does he have a "stamp of approval" via a=
 RAC, structuring, or Fundies rotation.  I suggested that he have a heart t=
o heart with Terry to assess whether his current skills are up to snuff.  T=
erry, have you had that discussion yet????  What is your independent assess=
ment of his capabilities????  As far as the Portland thing goes, I would ta=
ke Chris in Portland in a heartbeat.  If you would like me to call Suzette =
I'd be happy to.  Presto might be more effective since her alternative is a=
 rotation in east power.

Terry Donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence.=
  Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefit=
s of joining this effort?

The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the=
 EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management proce=
ss from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the se=
nior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findi=
ngs.

This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be a=
ppreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help. =20


Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is le=
aning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking =
for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (a=
nd also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to=
 get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.

Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring an=
d was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of=
 weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that=
 by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walkin=
g away from his commitment to structuring.  By the time he left he was almo=
st ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more.  He is definite=
ly someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John

The following information is from a Union source:
Union planning to go on strike at 6am tomorrow morning  (1200 employees of which 250 are Management)
The current shift is the last prior to the strike
Meeting continue today and through out the night
A Federal mediator has been bought in to try and help the situation
The only way the Union won't go on strike is if there is a tentative agreement in place with Midwest, however, everyone involved feels these chances are slim 
When a strike occurs, it will affect 7 plants

Kevin -

Please listen for good NQ-02 quotes in these 2 markets.  We are flying blind in these areas and I am most uncomfortable here. 

Overall, we will be a little exposed to a gas rally (e.g. hurricane fears) due to our ercot position.  we are monitoring closely.  I do not think we are prepared to start buying gas yet as we need to work on our side to determine our position on an MMbtu equivalent basis.

Also,  will probably want to sit down with you and legal re: NRG early this week.  Spoke with their VP of trading and he really thinks this is a clear cut case for them and expressed no desire to negotiate.  In fact, I think they will try to elevate to higher levels as they essentially are saying we are renegging.  As I said before, they are planning a visit with Duran over the next week or so.  Let me know if you would like to visit with me and Andy Edison (inside legal) and have Louise join us too.

Thanks,
Rogers

Terry Donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence.  Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefits of joining this effort?

The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management process from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the senior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findings.

This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be appreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help.  


Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is leaning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (and also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.

Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring and was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walking away from his commitment to structuring.  By the time he left he was almost ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more.  He is definitely someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.

Thanks for the info Heather.   In terms of forward curve, Entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now.   The equipment is probably of more interest as it relates to a packaged development for the Midway project in Florida.

Kevin,

FYI.  I spoke with a guy at Entergy in their merchant plant development group.  They have a site in Louisiana in advanced development (all permits, interconnection, water, etc) including a steam offtake agreement with an industrial host (2x1 combined cycle, 7FA turbines, approx. 550 MW).  They were scheduled to begin construction in the next few weeks.  Given the state of the market, Entergy management has pulled the plug on this project and they are looking to sell everything (permitted site, turbines, steam contract).  He wouldn't tell me where the plant was located in Louisiana except that it was on Entergy's system.  Looking through the development book, it looks like it could be the Lake Charles plant with PPG as steam host?  Given the steam sale, the effective heat rate he quoted was 6700 HHV (new and clean).

I know we aren't in the market for assets right now, but I wanted to pass on the information.  I've given this info to Carson and Jacoby as well.

Regards,

Heather

Guys -

I am not comfortable leaving the appropriations risk "grey", as it has been referred to.  The risk is there and it is real.  If the EES Executive Comittee is comfortable with this strategy/approach then I would expect to have something in writing between EES and EWS releasing EWS of any and all $$ reponsibility associated with this potential, yet unmentioned, risk.

FYI, last time we priced this risk we came up with a notional value of $5MM.

I am on board with providing aggressive pricing and trying to enter new markets.  However, we need to recognize all the risks.

I am asking for authorization to access the Enpower database- for East and West power curves. The Generator Earnings Model is currently accessing the power curves through an Excel spreadsheet given to us from the Structuring Group. We are asking for a restricted view into the Enpower Database to access the exact same information we are getting through the Excel Model. The information we need is monthly prices for 2 years. Direct access to the database will significantly improve the ability of the Earnings model to run efficiently and possibly avoid complications in the future.

The Generator Earnings Model will only be run internally and only our group (Financial Trading) has the authorization to run the model. All outputs of the model are kept internally as well. Several layers of security have been incorporated into the model to maintain confidentiality.

Thank you,
Michelle C. Ruch

Good info.   Consistent with reports from McGowan.   I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.   Love the spread given my view of natty.

Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call Alan.   You are certainly free to call him if you want.

You are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set=
 up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should=
 be:

=091) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition=
, risk systems, deal capture system, status of =09projects, schedule, etc.)
=092) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff, =
 and gas)
=093) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East ta=
riffs)
=094) Bernie presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal va=
luation, new model construction)
=095) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio=
 valuation - works with Richter)
=096) You and I find the holes and provide direction.

Your thoughts?

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing a=
nd valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B i=
s a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them s=
eparately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that =
gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather tha=
n a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

To all,

The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the=
 Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me k=
now if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points. =20

Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal =
in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The dea=
l is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, A=
ncillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site =
out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest stru=
ctures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the s=
ame time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will hel=
p highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's curren=
t state.

Quick statistics for ONE site:

Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months=
 (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) too=
k 8-9 hours to book.
Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hou=
rs to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not=
 booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).
Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least =
four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.
Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.
All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deal=
s.

Recommendations:

Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for=
 position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accoun=
ting, etc.
In the interim:

Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation proce=
ss.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting=
.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve =
shift, reg switch options, and new deals.
Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently ha=
ve an intramonth book).
Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a=
 stand-alone spreadsheet application.
Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves=
 into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).
Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk i=
nstead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports =
will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. =09


Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:

Week 1 (May 14-18)

Read Contract.
Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary'=
s, etc.
Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual=
 questions.
Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.

Week 2 (May 21-25)

Continue working on Full Requirements model.
Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points =
and curves in Enpower.=09
Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.
Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We h=
ad gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.
At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never=
 entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from=
 entering any new data.

Week 3 (May 29-June 1)

Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale mo=
del tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The=
 current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated u=
sing the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day p=
rice, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  =
This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the cur=
ves as $/Kw-month.
Again, we ran into problems with the test database.
Completed booking in Enpower.

Week 4 (June 4-5)

Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.
Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

Kevin, Louise was not comfortable on the contract numbers proposed for Gupta, Wang and Broderick.

She feels that it is not necessary to revise Broderick yet as his contract is not up until 4/30/02 and felt the numbers were too rich for Gupta and Wang.  When are you available to rework the numbers or do you want to speak to her about it first?  I know Dana is very anxious to get an agreement to Goutam.


Also, I spoke to Rogers last week to follow up on Narsima.  He wanted to change the signing cash to 30k and do away with the retention.  I suggested maybe increasing cash to 20k and 20k in equity and told him that since he was promoted to manager as Don and Juan, Louise may feel that we need to keep all packages consistent.  Rogers felt that there is a considerable distinction between Narsima and Don and Juan and thought would be able to sell this to Louise.  What are your thoughts?

We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).

This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.

Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business plan that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.

I didn't work with Ravi directly, however I believe he is extremely well qualified based on his experience. He would likely be a good asset for the group however I do not know exactly in what role (perhaps mid marketing or orig. or as a quant/trader).  What I am not sure of is if he wants to trade.  I will talk to him today and will get back to you.

I agree with Rogers.   Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market, it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs.   At that point, both entities will assume separate responsibility.

Subject:	Curve Marks thru 2/4 (maybe 2/5)

Kevin/Paul -

Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4.  Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time.

Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases).  My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed.  At that time, there will be two separate processes.  The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions.

In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes.  We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods.

Please let me know if you agree.

Rogers

Please follow-up with ERCOT ISO and/or ESCA to find out if there is a technical limitation with the software.   Can we please get an inside opinion on the "real" issue and the "real date" so we can properly assess wholesale and retail risk as a company.

Doug and Rogers -  Please work together on who is going to take the lead so don't have two different Enron people inquiring.   We may also want to consider using Tholan's intelligence group.

Subject:	RE: ERCOT Delay Risks

Rogers,

Given the Senate hearing results from Friday, I would certainly start building in some margin. The prevailing feeling was that there is no reason to start dereg if the systems cannot handle it. To their credit, however, the politicians stated that we need to know this sooner rather than later as there are significant ramifications if we are to delay it. The committee was cognizant of the financial exposure and also the erosion of public confidence in the event of a further delay.

The speed of completing customer switching is expected to ramp up now so that all pilot customers will be switched by mid to late Oct. That leaves one billing cycle before dereg. So, the latest we should know there is going to be a delay is Thanksgiving. ERCOT's past inability to inform the market of their delays should be resolved as they were heavily chastised for their commercial incompetence. The senate committee is also getting more actively involved as the skewed representation is concerning them-competitive retail has minimal voting rights.   

Recent changes in pricing mechanisms show that the ISO is very sensitive to the political forum and so I believe they will be a little more responsive to their demands. That is probably why the ISO has taken to 'fixing' price by not using the market bids when liquidity is light. This increases the uplift costs which are currently estimated around $0.50 MWh.

All in all, the wholesale operations are still sub-optimal but I believe, if the switching does occur, then we should be ok. The concern is the margin for error- the ISO will know late November giving you only a month at best. Restructuring these contracts to coincide with a threshold of completed switches would be the way to go.

In the meantime, Jean Ryall is working to monitor the next round of hearings. In addition, we should be able to get access to the chairs of this committee if need be.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Doug

Subject:	ERCOT Delay Risks



Kevin/John -

I am becoming concerned that ERCOT will not achieve full open access by 1/1/02.  Our sales are virtually all commencing 1/1/02.  A delay will result in foregone margin and possible incremental losses until such time we can physically serve.  For example, we will possibly be forced to serve our customers with regulated utility gen service until such time as ERCOT can fully implement direct access.  The cost are greater than our retail gen product and greater than our sales price = loss of margin + incremental losses due to costs above sales price.  (make sense?)

I have expressed this concern to EES Origination.  Margins are extremely tight in ERCOT, approximately $2.00 Mwh above offer and if we build in a fee/reserve to account for this risk we will probably shut down the TX effort.  Our competitors (absent Shell) are apparently not considering/pricing this risk.  In fact, the incumbent utilities have a natural hedge.  If open access is delayed then their customers just continue to pay higher tariff rates, thus they are incented not to assist in a speedy transition.

I suggested that at a minimum we reserve margin until we have a better feel for transition status but obviously received no nods of approval.  I will get with Steffes on Monday to get a feel from him, and Doug if you could provide your thoughts as well.  I am afraid we may have no choice other than imposing some price component to reflect this risk which could lead to our being viewed uncompetitive in the marketplace.  

One possible mitigation is to amend our contract to begin upon full transition date (or such earlier date if allowed). This would at least limit our exposure to loss of margin vs. additional incremental losses associated with our obligation to serve with reg gen.  Joe can you review contracts and determine what our obligation to serve is under existing contract and whether you think this idea would help mitigate.

I would like al of your thoughts as any move like this will receive significant resistance.

Rogers

Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people.   In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.

You are not off base with Steffes at all.

Only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist.   The nuclear fleet, if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems, will operate at 90-95% (95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years).
 
Remember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003.   The 2002 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal.

Guy,

Your intent for the conference calls was right. We need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers. But it must be a coordinated effort. There was no need to cancel the calls. Please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have, please contact  the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions. We appreciate your efforts and like ComEd and AEP, I am sure we will continue to work closely.

West - Pearce Hammond x3-1438

I have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets.    NEPOOL came off very hard today ($2.00/Mwh through 2006) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh.   I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don't see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading.

Again - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions.

Thanks.

Kevin -

This is the feedback we are getting on business in MA.  Honestly, I do not think we have won a deal of size up there in over 30 days.  We have reviewed our curves and feel they are very reasonable.  I will continue to investigate.

Also, reviewing recent losses - most keep coming from NE markets across the board.  We continued to get hit last Thurs and Fri.  It appears the changes there are much more rout of sync with the rest of the markets and extreme.  Are you following these moves for reasonableness and to make sure they are not just favorable to the underlying positions.  I just don't want to "negotiate" from in the whole.

If AES and SEL are offering deals like outlined below, maybe we can have them assume some of our load at a profit.

Due to problems on the J: Drive we are currently working on trying to restore the database that contained Lost/Closed Deals.  Attached is the last Lost/Closed Deal report.  Please note that we did not loose nor win any deals on Friday August 17.  However, we did loose a deal today:

Originator:		Malcolm Ticknor
Company Name:	 Wyman Gordon
Competitor:		 AESNewEnergy 
Competitor's Offer:	$51.95/ MWh.  for 12 months
EES Offer:		$56.3 which included $3 margin.  
Desk Offer:		$53.26
Spend:			38,000 MWh/year.

Hopefully the database will be back up tomorrow, and you will be able to see the report as usual.

Team,

I'm not sure what has been communicated regarding the enrollments.  I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the current status. 

The (5) packaged ice accounts were accepted by TXU and load availability was confirmed.  The 814 enrollment request will be submitted today/tomorrow by CSC.

The (28) target accounts were rejected by Reliant as the rate class is full. There is no load available.

Please advise if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Enron Corp (ENE) (48.34 +1.62)

DUKE ENERGY CORP. said it agreed to buy a 400-megawatt natural

Enron North America. The sale is expected to close in early
October 2001, Duke Energy said in a statement. The company
declined to disclose the terms of the sale.

I just spoke with Kevin and he is certain that his deal on the interest was 8%.  What would the additional adjustment be if the interest were reset to 8% (as opposed to 8.5%)?  Would it be an additional adjustment of $218,000?  Please let me know so that Kevin can broach the issue with John.

I understand and agree with everything, except 8% was the agreed upon interest rate as noted on the economic runs which establised the demand payment between my book and New Albany, LLC.   It is clear that 8% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 9% to 8%.

The approx $6MM of capital improvements were spent January thru June 2000.  The effect is an additional $1.2MM a year of depreciation for 2001.  I am not sure what Kevin is looking at, but Jenny's 2001 Plan had $17.4MM and we are currently forecasting $17.3MM for 2001.

With regard to the Capital Charge issue.  The interest rate that we were told to use by Delainey was 9% - we have since found out that Lavo is using 8.5% - therefore, in June we will credit the New Albany project with $218K of interest.  Again, Jenny's plan showed $11.8 and the 2001 forecast is $11.8(using 8.5%).  The estimate using 8% is $10.7MM.

Finally, there is only $54K remaining in New Albany's major maintenance account.  We stopped booking a per start accrual sometime last year on all of the Peakers since none of the plants except New Albany were using the reserve.  If my memory serves me correctly, Kelley Huntley and Jenny Latham met with Jody, myself and Scott Chambers in OEC to make this decision - and Jenny discussed it with Kevin.  There was nothing planned for major maintenance.

Please feel free to forward this on to Kevin so that he and Lavorato can resolve these issues.  Let me know if you or Kevin need any additional information regarding New Albany.

I am not sure if I mentioned the depreciation issue on the voicemail.  The issue is that there was an increase in the capital cost of the plant (due to additional upgrades and CAPEX that was done after Kevin's agreement with Lavo was cut).  This resulted in an increase in the actual depreciation figures.  Kevin feels that his original deal, based upon the cost of the plant at the time, should be honored.

We would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time (5 minutes ahead, if possible).   Rather than an obligation (like FTR's), we prefer an option (spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised).
 
I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.   Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).
 
Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.   This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.
 
Call me with any additional questions.

Dana/Kevin
 
I would like to chat with both of you regarding what specific interests the desk would have in securing transmission rights between CT and Long Island.
 
As you may recall, NU is proposing to build this line on a merchant basis, and are seeking proposals on 8/17/01 (one week from this coming Friday).
 
My thinking is we may want to bid for some capacity on this line outright (how many MW? what term?), and potentially consider some more innovative structures such as:
 

Bring some debt or mezzanine funding to the table to help get the project financed, and get some options to take capacity on the line in return (what type of optionality -- desired term, preference for physical rights or financial settlements based on LMPs, etc -- would we find most valuable?) 
Provide hedging products such as a CT-LI spread collar to enhance NU's ability to finance the project -- e.g., sell them a put option on the CT-LI bi-directional spread to insure some minimum cash flow on the line, in return for them selling us a call on the spread.

I am beginning to work with structuring to pull some values together, but I wanted to get your input on how to proceed.  Can we plan to speak sometime today/tomorrow?  Please let me know what times work for the two of you.  Thanks

John

Make sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any VEPCO interface (hourly or day-ahead), and the PJM/VEPCO PJM LMP index is for pricing only.

Subject:	Update following our meeting re. VEPCO
Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings "PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP" (the "Index"). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').

I do not agree with this approach.   We are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade.  I strongly object to your recommended approach.

Subject:	How to Handle "Oops" Trades on EnronOnline

Kevin:

From time to time, we are notified that one of our traders has mistakenly posted a trade on EnronOnline or that a counterparty hit a bid or offer on EnronOnline by mistake.  In the past, the traders were instructed that if such an "oops" trade occurred, they should enter into an offsetting trade with the counterparty.  Confirmations would then be sent out for each of the offsetting transactions.  Several counterparties have objected to receiving confirmations for such transactions, and from Enron's perspective, entering into offsetting transactions is less than optimal.

Accordingly, for all future oops trades, the traders should be instructed NOT to enter into an offsetting transaction.  Instead, I recommend that our traders take the following steps:

A.  If both traders agree that an oops trade has occurred, 

	1.  Agree to terminate the transaction and let the counterparty know that we will send a short written termination agreement.  

	2.  Notify Melissa Murphy at *31886 that the transaction has been terminated.  Melissa will make the appropriate entry in Enpower and will notify me so that I can prepare the termination letter.

B.  If the counterparty makes the mistake, we are not required to terminate the trade.  The counterparty agreed to be bound by the terms of its EnronOnline trades when it accepted the Electronic Trading Agreement.  It is up to our trader to decide whether to agree to terminate the trade.  Our trader can agree to terminate the trade only in exchange for some form of compensation, for example.

C.  If our trader made the mistake and the counterparty refuses to terminate the trade, give me a call so that we can discuss the options.

Please give me a call at your convenience to discuss.

Regards,

Leslie

I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.
 
I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.
 
I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.

Kevin,

We spoke some time ago about a proposal to buy down deductibles for our power assets and I recall receiving your authorization to proceed as respects the New Albany plant.  To recap, the deductibles under the Enron Corp property and business interruption policy were increased at the last renewal from $500,000 per occurrence to $5 million per occurrence effective March 1. We were shopping a number of options to buy this deductible down to $1 million for property damage and 30 day waiting period for business interruption.  This coverage was bound effective June 12 (the reason for the time lag is extreme volatility in the insurance market for power assets) at an allocation of $345,000 for New Albany.  I also checked with Stuart and he sees no transactional issues relative to the buydown.
I understand that you have also purchased the dual trigger BI policy that effectively mitigates this initial 30 day waiting period exposure, so the BI coverage under the corporate program applies as a further risk mitigant for the catastrophic event. 

Since it's been awhile since our last conversation, I did want to reconfirm the buydown option and premium charge with you.
Please give me a call with any questions

Kevin -

Just got off the phone with Jackie Thomas at Relaint.  I worked with Jackie many years ago and I think he runs their power trading desk.  Anyway, he said he has had heartburn with the way EOL notifies users of contract/confirm changes.  EOL puts up a banner notifying the user of the change but he claims that if the user does not log on for several days then the banner may not appear, yet the contract change has been implemented.  Jackie cited the specific instance of the ERCOT 138 kv delivery requirement as an example of a change that apparently "slipped by".  Jackie feels that either the banner should stay active on a user by user basis until that user logs in and acknowledges it or a notice should be sent to a legal contact at the company - preferably both.  He does not feel as though our legal group appreciates his concern and their legal group is recommending that they halt trading on EOL unless some safeguards are implemented - he does not want to do this.

I am not sure if the situation he described is accurate, but I did want this info to be conveyed and I think someone from EOL should call him to discuss.  Jackie's number is 713-2071308.  I would be glad to continue to facilitate discussions if necessary.

Thanks,
Rogers

Kevin,

Currently, we do not have delivery points established for PJM West or Ontario.  Will these be primary points or will they be dependent upon another curve?!  

Also, I just want to ensure that there have been no revisions to what you previously passed on regarding gas trading - only you and the desk heads (you, Dana, Fletch, Rogers, Harry and Doug).  I have set up gas price books already and I am in the process of setting up Gas Daily books (basis and index) for those mentioned.  Any additions/deletions/corrections?!

Thanks for the input.

Distributed  Generation Conference
August 7-10, 2001 Denver, Colorado
 Overview

The distributed generation (DG) market is growing  rapidly, estimated to reach 25-30 gigawatts by 2010. Join us at the Distributed  Generation Conference and hear the latest information and overview of the  business and technical prospects for distributed generation. Our panel of expert  speakers will address the economics of distributed generation, evolving  regulatory policies, market projections, interconnection challenges, pricing  issues and much more. The Conference will also debate the role of distributed  generation (where and how), and identify the strengths and weaknesses of the  different generation technologies.
The brochure for the Conference and associated  Workshops is attached in pdf format. Please print the brochure and fax the registration  form back to us at 303-741-0849 if you would like to attend. Or you may register  online.
 

Electric Power  Market Performance Conference
September 20-21, 2001, Denver,  Colorado
  Overview

Each year there is additional opportunity to draw  lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market  performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at  least in the Eastern Interconnection and Ercot. One focus of this conference  will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new Ercot markets,  the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in  developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the  Midwest.
A second focus of this conference will be on the  existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their  internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory  agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based  incentive systems for transmission expansion.
Finally, the conference will highlight one of the  important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the  explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.
The brochure for the Conference and associated  Workshop is attached in pdf format.Please print the brochure and fax the registration form back to us at  303-741-0849 if you would like to attend. Or you may register  online.

We are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy.   Most regions have markets on-line through 2003 (TVA, Ent, Cinergy, Com-ed).   In NY, there is zero liqidity for off-peak.   PJM West has pretty decent liquidity through 03.

I hope this helps.

If I could see some off-peak markets I would be buying.  Unfortunately, I know info like this will just be used against me and the positions I am fighting.  Looks like we should be on the bid for some of these coal terminals from the producers.

I have spent more time down that black hole called coal and have gotten even
more bullish than I was when we spoke last. I wanted to give you some
initial reactions, and hope that you will call to discuss your reaactions to
my reactions (if that make sense to you).

In looking at the MSHA data under a finer and finer slice, I was somewhat
surprised to see the purging of employees in NAPP and CAPP. I have also been
making the rounds in the major NAPP and CAPP basins to gauge the level of
new activity, but it is surprising how sluggish the rebound is and will be.
One could write that off to new problems with permitting (intermittent
streams has become a real problem I am told) and/or to hiring problems while
fighting off the coal unions some more. The other theory is that this
oligopology that has gotten its sea legs! I am leaning towards a theory that
the latter will use the former for cover. Given how bad EIA is, that cover
could last a while. This market is ripe for a squeezing IF gas tightens a
bit and net exports is somewhat inelastic at these levels!

Further, it appears clear that aside from being horrible at managing data
and the needs of the public, EIA is incompetent at analysis. I do not think
we built inventory during 1Q01; it was mostly stocks (producer/distributor)
moving to market. I now understand why you were focusing upon my gas
substitution comments. The other area of opportunity is EXIM. No doubt you
have continued to see the drift in international freight and coal prices.
How low can it go (EXIM) - we are in unchartered territory! I know Hill &
Associates think that the US can become an importer over the longer pull.
The problem is the offloading at terminals (what you load, you can't
necessarily offload) and whose terminals they are. Look at the ownership of
the major terminals and you find coal producers.

I have told our gas guys that I am growing more confident that gas will gain
ground from coal this time around for the structural reaons I gave you plus
the fundamental reasons as well. If today's AGA is bullish again, this could
be the makings of an interesting market op.

Allan Stewart

Subject:	Gulf Power 20 Year Deal

I have been trying to run some P&L with regards to hub changes and changes in ancillary assumptions.  I came across the fact that our Gulf Power deal with Enron Compression Services goes through 2022 but the off peak curves only go out until 2019.  Therefore the P&L has not been taking into account curve shift with the unerlying for these years.  We basically have a position marked against a zero price.  I am working with Ress and Jeff Jackson to resolve this issue.  Just wanted to keep you aware of the situation.  Since this is an off peak price out beyond the normal curves, I was going to have the curve generator pull the 2019 price and increase it based on the percentage increase in on peak prices for the respective years 2020-2022.  I will also calculate the P&L associated with this change to see when we want to recognize it.  Let me know what you have any comments and or suggestions.  Thanks.

Bal year: $0.50
Cal '02 : $1.00
Cal '03: $1.50
Cal '04 :$2.00
Etc

May pull back in by $0.50 if it looks like liquidity is returning farther out the curve.

Need any crude?

John Dorbone (sp?).   You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site.   They have 4 custom builders (Tom Bailey, Pine Oak, Country Village, and Tom Hale).   They recently fired Coventry and Frederick Harris.

I have not made a decision yet, but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative.   It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house.

Doesn't it become a free option if you can serve physically or reg-gen via utility tariff.   For example in Illinois and Ohio, wouldn't these markets create free options if the wholesale price goes below reg gen?

Kevin - 

we were in the process of extracting all of these options into a separate book for ease of identification and management.  This process was stalled so that we did not create unexpected errors surrounding our current CA efforts.  However, I spoke to Don and I think we are back on track.  Jay - can we pull together this info one way or another (prioritize our top 5 positions maybe).

Also, this does not create a free option.  To the extent the wholesale prices decline to the point where they equal the assumed underlying transition supply values then we should have no losses associated with erroneous dereg date assumptions.  However, if you step in and buy the wholesale power to "mitigate" this exposure and the wholesale curve continues to drop, you could be faced with new wholesale losses - especially if dereg is stalled and we have to purchase tarriff power at a pass-through and absorb our new wholesale hedge position loss.

Bottom line:  The loss associated with blown dereg assumptions decreases as wholesale prices drop to a point - we should be in good shape here as this will definitely minimize our clean-up costs associated with these errors.  We can probably best manage this exposure by purchasing wholesale call options as we observe the wholesale curve drop below the regulated tariff energy price.

Per Lavo, he would like to see ASAP the break-even price on the reg-switch options where length was booked and when wholesale goes below tariff, we can cover and re-create free option.

When can we have summary valuation of this done for East positions?

The only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop.

I don't know what caused this, but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run.   In addition, the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow.   Is this normal?

Any thoughts?

Kevin,

We spoke some time ago about a proposal to buy down deductibles for our power assets and I recall receiving your authorization to proceed as respects the New Albany plant.  To recap, the deductibles under the Enron Corp property and business interruption policy were increased at the last renewal from $500,000 per occurrence to $5 million per occurrence effective March 1. We were shopping a number of options to buy this deductible down to $1 million for property damage and 30 day waiting period for business interruption.  This coverage was bound effective June 12 (the reason for the time lag is extreme volatility in the insurance market for power assets) at an allocation of $345,000 for New Albany.  I also checked with Stuart and he sees no transactional issues relative to the buydown.
I understand that you have also purchased the dual trigger BI policy that effectively mitigates this initial 30 day waiting period exposure, so the BI coverage under the corporate program applies as a further risk mitigant for the catastrophic event. 

Since it's been awhile since our last conversation, I did want to reconfirm the buydown option and premium charge with you.
Please give me a call with any questions

David

We have put money in the netco fundy budget with trey hardy to complete the new lmp project.  Looks like a 45 to 60 day effort once we have money approved by netco.

The rest will not be a big effort but we will be a little slower for new requests due to a shortage of IT staff. However the majority of our process's are fairly automated.

Subject:	5/18 Enron Emissions Strategy Meeting

Dear Kevin,

Per our conversation, here is some background on the meeting on Friday and a preliminary agenda.  Please let me know who
from your group will attend.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

All the best,

Lisa

 

Background on Meeting:

Enron's Environmental Strategies group will convene an "Emissions Strategy Meeting" on Friday May 18.  
Based on very positive responses, we expect participation from a number of commercial groups from within Enron -- including Enron Europe, EES, ENA, ETS, EGM and others.

The meeting will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (including lunch) in room 8C1, 8th floor of the Enron Building.  (Representatives of Enron Europe will participate in the morning session by video conference, and others from various locations will participate by telephone.)

The objectives of the session are to:

1) provide Enron commercial and support groups with the latest information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide, and

2) receive feedback on commercial interests and input on policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both the short and long term.

Can you please add Rogers to the interview list.   I like Dale as a candidate to run the URM desk.  Given that Jay Lewis has expressed interest in moving into a marketing role under Dave & Janet, we very much need a solid sr. person to run this group.   I understand the West is trying to get one of Jay's people to come to Portland.   Is Dale a candidate to run both groups?

If Jay leaves, we are big time short.

Subject:	Dale Furrow Interview

Many of you know Dale Furrow already.  For those who don't, he ran our structuring group in Portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  He's an Army Grad, Wharton Grad, went through the Associate program and left Enron as a Director to join Entergy's Asset Development group working for Jeff Roberts.  He recently tendered his resignation at Entergy and is on the job market.  He is leaving Entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.

Dale has a great background for many of the EES/EWS work that we are trying to do now.  He was an AWESOME structurer.  He "gets" trading.  He was responsible for the development and implementation of Entergy Power Marketing's risk systems.  In short, he would be a great catch for us.

I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will interview Dale on Tuesday.  I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday, so they would have to do it later.  Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday.  

I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him.  I think that he could run a URM desk (east or west).  He could run the site profile, asset profile, dsm group.  I would expect that he would expect to come in at a VP level.  I know that's a high bar and hard to do here, which is why I would want this group of people to meet with him.  I have asked Debra Davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews.

Thanks,
Tim

The only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply (pet coke, PRB, other, etc.) for $1.00-1.15/MMBtu delivered to the site.   The economics need to show a 8-10% IRR in order to justify the commodity risk.

In addition, we should explore IGCC in Florida.   The gas/coal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better.

Kevin,

Don has asked me to provide you with some sort of valuation matrix based on your request of the other day.  I have spent some time with Stacey White, Jody Pierce and Georgeanne Hodges in an effort to better understand how New Albany is being valued/treated for accounting purposes.  When you have a free moment, could you spend a few minutes with me to give me a better idea of what you would like to see.  Thanks

Zisman

As an aside, we heard from CLECO on New Albany.  They gave us a bid range of $98MM- $122MM without any suggestion that they would insist upon a toll for this summer.

Wisconsin's offer is a joke.   
 
Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).   We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long.   This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value.   I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate.   We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.   I would accept nothing less  than $1.2 million.
 
Thanks.

This contract is for 50Mw peak into COMED, Seller's Daily Choice, Cal '02 @ $34.75/MWh.  Our MTM is $1,244,412; their offer is $663,000.  It appears to be a one-way contract, but it's hard to tell given the brevity of the contract.  David - what happens if we don't serve the load - do we get nothing?  We need to decide if we want to begin serving the load and negotiate a better price - they want to have done by 12/28.

Industry notes on curtailments and closures


RandomLengths
09/27/2001


Plywood/OSB


Advanced Wood Resources, Brownsville, Ore., will cease all operations as of November 20. "Severe competition from the lower-priced OSB, combined with challenging economic conditions and rising costs associated with increased environmental standards," were cited as reasons for the closure.

Georgia-Pacific has announced plans to shut down nine plywood mills in the South for one week starting October 1 to replenish log supplies.

Hunt Forest Products will shut down its plywood mill in Natalbany, La., for one week starting October 1 due to tight log supplies.

LP has announced market-related downtime at most of its U.S. and Canadian OSB mills. Most of the mills will be down a minimum of one week, starting October 8. Plants in Sagola, Mich., and Jasper, Texas, will be down the week of October 1. Hayward, Wis., will be down the week of October 15. Carthage, Texas, will be down the week of September 24. And Silsbee, Texas, will be down the week of October 8 and for four to six weeks thereafter for a press rebuild.

Willamette Industries' plywood mill in Dodson, La., will shut down the week of September 24 for scheduled maintenance.


LUMBER


Harwood Products, Branscomb, Calif., has cut production by 20% due to market conditions

Weyerhaeuser will close its three Cedar sawmills in British Columbia for an indefinite duration beginning next week. Market conditions were cited.

Canadian Forest Products will reduce output at its sawmills in British Columbia and Alberta by an estimated 70 million board feet during October.

Abitibi Consolidated plans to cut production by about 25% at all of its sawmills over the next four weeks. "Market conditions and supplemental export costs" were cited as reasons for the curtailments.

My preference is normal energy only LD language.  If we agree to use an index pricing point (like PJM/VEPCO interface), then a fair trade-off is to eliminate the capacity ratchet.

Kevin 

Doe this mean you think we should leave in the other damages e.g a fixed payment of $42,000 if we do not deliver for a scheduled day (the actual payment required to be paid to VEPCO for non-peak day damages is based in total MWH not delivered and is derived from the following formulae: 

(1 - MWH Delivered/MWH Scheduled) times Annual Capacity Payments/365 (this number equals approx $42,000)

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy.  Yesterday we talked about normal LDs.  This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices.

 Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay:

1.  Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either

(A)  If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or 

(B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); 

Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)


Thanks

Subject:	Update following our meeting re. VEPCO
Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings "PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP" (the "Index"). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').

Kevin --

Eddy Daniels is interested in coming over to UBS Reg Affairs.  He is currently in ENA Legal working primarily on M&A activities (worked last year on Cuiaba and has been working on the UBS deal).

I would like you to meet him.  He is very interested in coming over and helping out.  Will take a little educating, but I think that he can get up to speed quickly and will definitely be someone that can help us through the start-up work.

Can you talk with him tomorrow or Friday?

Subject:	RE: ERCOT Delay Risks

Rogers,

Given the Senate hearing results from Friday, I would certainly start building in some margin. The prevailing feeling was that there is no reason to start dereg if the systems cannot handle it. To their credit, however, the politicians stated that we need to know this sooner rather than later as there are significant ramifications if we are to delay it. The committee was cognizant of the financial exposure and also the erosion of public confidence in the event of a further delay.

The speed of completing customer switching is expected to ramp up now so that all pilot customers will be switched by mid to late Oct. That leaves one billing cycle before dereg. So, the latest we should know there is going to be a delay is Thanksgiving. ERCOT's past inability to inform the market of their delays should be resolved as they were heavily chastised for their commercial incompetence. The senate committee is also getting more actively involved as the skewed representation is concerning them-competitive retail has minimal voting rights.   

Recent changes in pricing mechanisms show that the ISO is very sensitive to the political forum and so I believe they will be a little more responsive to their demands. That is probably why the ISO has taken to 'fixing' price by not using the market bids when liquidity is light. This increases the uplift costs which are currently estimated around $0.50 MWh.

All in all, the wholesale operations are still sub-optimal but I believe, if the switching does occur, then we should be ok. The concern is the margin for error- the ISO will know late November giving you only a month at best. Restructuring these contracts to coincide with a threshold of completed switches would be the way to go.

In the meantime, Jean Ryall is working to monitor the next round of hearings. In addition, we should be able to get access to the chairs of this committee if need be.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Doug

Kevin/John -

I am becoming concerned that ERCOT will not achieve full open access by 1/1/02.  Our sales are virtually all commencing 1/1/02.  A delay will result in foregone margin and possible incremental losses until such time we can physically serve.  For example, we will possibly be forced to serve our customers with regulated utility gen service until such time as ERCOT can fully implement direct access.  The cost are greater than our retail gen product and greater than our sales price = loss of margin + incremental losses due to costs above sales price.  (make sense?)

I have expressed this concern to EES Origination.  Margins are extremely tight in ERCOT, approximately $2.00 Mwh above offer and if we build in a fee/reserve to account for this risk we will probably shut down the TX effort.  Our competitors (absent Shell) are apparently not considering/pricing this risk.  In fact, the incumbent utilities have a natural hedge.  If open access is delayed then their customers just continue to pay higher tariff rates, thus they are incented not to assist in a speedy transition.

I suggested that at a minimum we reserve margin until we have a better feel for transition status but obviously received no nods of approval.  I will get with Steffes on Monday to get a feel from him, and Doug if you could provide your thoughts as well.  I am afraid we may have no choice other than imposing some price component to reflect this risk which could lead to our being viewed uncompetitive in the marketplace.  

One possible mitigation is to amend our contract to begin upon full transition date (or such earlier date if allowed). This would at least limit our exposure to loss of margin vs. additional incremental losses associated with our obligation to serve with reg gen.  Joe can you review contracts and determine what our obligation to serve is under existing contract and whether you think this idea would help mitigate.

I would like al of your thoughts as any move like this will receive significant resistance.

Subject:	Nuclear Meetings

Kevin,
After reviewing the list of NRC meetings coming up, Fred has notified me of
the two he thinks are of significance for attendance.  They are:

1. 11/30/01 - Surry 1, 2 - Discuss significance of failed piston wrist pins
& piston carrier bearings in the Number 3 Emergency Diesel Generator which
may have caused it to fail if needed to operate a long period.
HGP Comment: This may give insight on Surry 1 refueling and possible
shutdown of Surry 2 for mitigation of problem.  This will also impact other
plants with the same EDGs.

2. 12/12/01 - Ginna - Discuss status of RG&E evaluation regarding
circumferential cracking of the reactor vessel head penetration nozzles.
HGP Comment: This should provide info on whether Ginna will be required to
shutdown for inspection and additional info on other area PWRs concerning
shutdown inspection schedules.

Please let me know if you agree that we should attend. Currently we have
attended seven meetings of the eight allowed by the contract through
November.  None of the meetings for early December are of significance.  It
is highly unlikely that any significant meetings will be scheduled for late
December.  So, the above two meetings should probably be the last of
significance for the calendar year.

Dan

Don't worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year.   It was by far the best regulatory effort (from a power perspective) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at Enron.   You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together, we will reap the benefits for years to come.

Subject:	analyst question
Sensitivity:	Confidential

In the process of interviewing Paul Thomas for a promotion into the AA program, the feedback from some of the interviewers suggests that perhaps he would be more appropriate as an associate rather than an analyst.  He is currently listed as a specialist but has a history of excellent performance and 4-5 years work experience.  Would you be open to considering an associate role for him?

*Note...as a point of reference, you have Eric Saibi and Peter Makkai slotted for analysts.

Subject:	Court Order on MAPP Refund Appeal

The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a decision today upholding FERC's order requiring MAPP to provide refunds to transmission customers on MAPP's system.  As you may recall, in response to EPMI's 1997 complaint against MAPP regarding the unauthorized assessment of third party compensation charges assessed on import and export transactions, FERC ordered MAPP (and its utility members) to pay refunds to customers.  EPMI's refund, including interest, was $750,000.

The utilities appealed FERC's order, arguing that FERC erred in ordering refunds.  EPMI filed a counter-appeal, arguing that FERC did not go far enough and the refunds should have been greater.  Our primary goal in filing the appeal was to counteract the utilities' argument and give the Court the other side of the story.  

Although the Court did not grant EPMI's appeal, we're very pleased that the Court rejected the utilities' argument to revoke the refunds.   Now, unless the utilities appeal this to the Supreme Court (which is highly unlikely), EPMI's refund will no longer be subject to dispute.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sarah

Here is some information that you probably are already aware of, but just in
case......

You may recall that Com Ed sold all of their coal-fired units and gas fired
units to EME (Edison Mission Energy). I don't remember exactly how many
megawatts are now owned and controlled by Mission, but it is between 15,000
and 20,000 MW throughout Northern Illinois.   Mission's union has authorized
a strike to be effective June 1.  Unlike Peoples, Mission does not have many
management employees in the Chicago area (Mission is a California-based
corporation).  Therefore the odds of the plants remaining in operation
during a strike are low.  They would likely keep a couple of key plants on,
and the rest would idle.

Power prices currently do not support operation of Allegheny or
Constellation, but a large outage may change that.  Bill Quigley has some
good contacts that have been keeping him up to date on the status of this.
If they strike we may see Allegheny, Constellation and Elwood fire even when
weather is not extreme.

Obviously, we will not deliver (or receive if we are long) if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a "net counterparty" basis.   Therefore, FE and TXU obligations would not be met for the 1st week of January because they result in negative cash flow.
 
Cory,
Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections.   Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from  the net position report as well.   We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday.

Kevin,
 
Rick Shapiro asked me to return to Govt. Affairs in February to help manage the fallout from the CA energy crisis.  We've got teams targeted at CA, the western states, New York and Washington, DC.
 
There's a lot going on in NY right now, and the new Executive Director of IPPNY really needs to get up to speed with marketing/trading issues directly related to NY.  I think Tom - if he has time - could really be helpful to us in this situation.  He knows how the market trades in NY, the impacts of price caps/penalties, the behavior of the utilities, etc. 
 
I only need one day of his time.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Tom.....per our discussion a few weeks ago.  I was wondering if you would be interested in going to NY with me to "educate" a few people on the NY power trading market?  The person who needs the most educating is Gavin Donohue, Executive Director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, who is out there talking with the press and regulators about the RTO and the NY marketplace.  He comes from the DEC and knows about environmental issues and generator issues but has a lot to learn about marketers/traders.  Enron is a member of IPPNY and Gavin is new to the organization.  Both Mirant and I agree that we need to be spending more time with Gavin educating him.  What do you think?  Can we schedule something in the near future??

I hear you on the liquidity Rogers.   With Rob making those markets effective next Monday (he is on vacation), we will find out if term liquidity is possible.

Please trust me on this issue.   You will see a significant difference within weeks, not months.   At a minimum, you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders (they may be $3 wide in New York, but that is better than no market).

Keep pushing on this issue.   With the volatility in the NE over the past two weeks, I'm sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas.

As far as 02 or 03 quotes for E PJM and/or NY, I have heard no markets today and neither has Dana.   The pool is blowing up as we speak.

If I could do one thing I would buy a piece of those.  However, it is hard not seeing anything on EOL.  Kevin, I think we have to seriously reconsider our ability to support EES Northeast business if these markets are not liquid enough.

project. The project is filing its Article 10 application after having 
invested substantial money and resources. The permit issuance looks good, 
energy pricing has held up well, and this project will be part of the first 
group to be licenced.

I suggest setting up a meeting with all of my desk heads after your meeting with REFCO.   At that point in time, you can provide an overview of the deal structure and we can talk about East Power requirements.

Kevin

Thanks for your response.  During their visit here, we are going to go through the various products that we already make markets for and try to come up with a short list of products to start with that would appeal to their customer base.  In regards to the fixed monthly premium, did you have a number in mind and if not what are the variables that would factor into that decision.  You had also said during our initial presentation of the concept to you that you wanted to have a meeting with your various desk heads to make sure all the angles are thought through.  After this visit, we should have a much clearer idea of what the deal would look like and we can schedule this meeting.  I would be happy to come up and talk to you about this if you desire.

JC

With respect to East Power markets, I would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bid/offer in return for Refco's access to our markets.

Subject:	REFCO Project Update

Gentlemen

I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.

To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.

All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.

Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical. 

Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.

Regards

John Cummings

You caught that.  I guess that's fair.   We would likely leave around 1:00 pm CPT which would put us in Portland at 2:30 (West time).

Does this work?

I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.

I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:

	1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required)
	2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time)
	3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.
	4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday
	5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)

Let me know if this works for you guys.

Kevin,
	We will continue to monitor the situation and update you as information is received.

The Union is waiting on a NRB (National Labor Relations Board) ruling which should happen this afternoon or Monday.  This ruling could mandate Midwest to come to the negotiation table.
If the ruling says Midwest doesn't have to "go to the table" then the Union will strike.  It will take 1-2 weeks for the workers to organize a strike after the NRB ruling is made.  According to labor insiders, when the workers walk out they will either turn the machines over to non-union workers or turn them off.  The labor source believes that Midwest does not have the non-union workforce needed to take over for the union workers in the event of a strike.
If the ruling says Midwest has to "go to the table" then by law they will have to begin negotiations.

All East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me.    With respect to regions, assume the same organization as we ended with in early November.   The one change is Rogers in the SE along with Suarez, and Carson.

MW - Fletch, Russell, and Jason
SE - Rogers, Suarez, Carson
ERCOT - Doug, King, Schiavone, Saibi
NE - Dana, Benson, Gupta, Broderick, Thomas (off-peak), Misra, Rogers, Makkai, Step, Schneider
Options - Arora, Stalford, Wang, Gualy
Real-Time - Forney (ERCOT), Baughman (MW/SE), Miguel (MW/SE)

Remember, all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well.   None of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas.

Kevin,

In an attempt to begin the setup of trading books and desks for Netco, we will need a list of desk assignments (i.e. which trader will be trading which region) and the regional organization (i.e. Northeast, Midwest, etc.) of such desks.  Also, will East traders be trading only east delivery points?

Thanks!

A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.

We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.

Are you guys in?   We will have a blast.

Please begin working on filling our Associated short position in 02.   I would like to take this risk off the books.

In addition, please find out what a buy-out of VEPCO would cost us.   With Rogers transitioning to run our retail risk management, I would like to clean up our customer positions.

We also need to continue to explore a JEA buy-out.

As you finalize the personnel issues, any information regarding which trader will be managing each location is extremely helpful.  The reason for this is because we must apply the trader to the appropriate product(s) in order to test the system completely.  Using the information you provide, we will be able to make sure the traders are set up correctly prior to our go-live date.

Kevin, 

Please identify which trader will be managing the locations you have listed below so we can have the system fully tested as soon as possible.  I understand that we will be using peak and off-peak only for the locations below.  We will work with the trader of the Ontario location and Leslie Hansen to develop this location, as we do not have anything in the system for this yet.  Thanks, in advance, for your response.

Kim please advise on the possibility of providing Rika with her new wage as one lump sum rather than waiting until Feb for the other half.

Rika has worked very hard to take our floor to the next level and will be critical for us to continue and I would like to see if we have any latitude to provide her with the above as part of her promotion.  

I explained to her what Kevin's long term objective is for Managers and how he fairly levels the playing field at year end.

Russell would like for you to meet with him for an informational interview. An in person meeting would be preferable,

but whatever is available with your schedule is fine.  My understanding is that he is not formally looking for a job

yet, but trying to get a feel for different types of positions available within the energy industry. Erik is the son of

one of Russell's clients and will graduate from school in May.  I will try to get more color from Russell and forward it

Obviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.   My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.   No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.

Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  

For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:

1. New Gen
2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
4. Coal- utility stockpiles

I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.

I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:

	1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required)
	2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time)
	3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.
	4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday
	5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)

Let me know if this works for you guys.

I will pay $500k over the mid-curve.   Morgan and JEA will be your best counterparties.   I would proceed by showing them a bid for the shaped obligation that is flat to our mid, thus leaving you with 500k of orig value.   Before we show a written or verbal bid, please get approval from me.

Thanks.

Kevin,

While I realize this position become less of a problem as the markets continue their downfall, it still remains a problem.  I've spoken with you about the best offers, but below is a list of all offers:

Morgan Stanley
     Offered $44/MWh for on-peak and $29/MWh for off-peak, matching the JEA monthly MW requirement exactly.  Firm LD offer.

Cargill
     Offered $8 over your EOL, into SOCO offer price for on-peak, 10/1/01 - 2/28/02 only.  62MW is all he can offer.  Firm LD offer.  No offer for off-peak.

FP&L
     Offered $45/MWh for the 7x24, matching the shaped on- and off-peak schedule.  Offer is system firm, with our purchase subordinate to native load, but not to water heater and pool pump load (about 160MW of load that could be cut before us).

I'm still awaiting offers from JEA/TEA, which they said should be available in the next few days.  So far, Morgan Stanley has offered the best in terms of price and matching our MW needs, but is still priced at $6-$7 over your mid.  

 

Billy

I wanted to give you a quick update on this.  After reviewing the various a=
ngles on this with structuring, it was evident that the best real prospect =
for doing something with them was for us to receive a below mkt position fr=
om Calpine off of Dighton (so as to force Coenergy (gas supplier) to make a=
s large a termination pmt to Calpine as possible).  In return, we would pro=
vide some other form of value (e.g., low cost capital to facilitate re-fina=
ncing of Dighton once gas agreement terminated, we sell them a below mkt po=
sition in another region, etc.).   I floated this proposal verbally to Paul=
 Barnett about a 1-1.5 weeks ago, and his reaction was sort of "that sounds=
 interesting" but he didn't show a great deal of genuine interest.  I indic=
ated to him that I would work up a more specific written proposal.   Howeve=
r, after discussing with our legal dept, they had some real angst of me mak=
ing a formal written proposal to them in this regard (concerns centering ar=
ound tortious interference, etc.).  Based on that, I called Barnett back sa=
ying I was unable to make a formal written proposal along the lines of my v=
erbal proposal to him, but that we would still be interested and indicated =
that the ball is in his court if he wants to pursue that angle.  As yet I h=
ave not heard back from him, and i do not hold a lot of hope that they want=
 to pursue this.   Kevin - please let me know if you think trying to chase =
this more makes sense based on your discussions with Paul P. a few weeks ba=

For 01 and 02, congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $3.50 to $4.50/Mwh.   Current EES curves are light in this area.

For 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated, the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh (based on actual congestion $'s from May 99 to date in the Boston area).

Much like the Dallas situation, these locational congestion charges can be significant and Rogers and Don will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now.

I hope this helps.

My understanding is that Shell can put them back to Calpine.   Remember, the deal was an all-requirements supply deal for all of Shell's retail obligations in ERCOT which are now zero.

Kevin & John -

We will likely experience significant exposure as a result of force majeure related to the recent WTC events.  A preliminary assessment is as follows:

Total exposure $7MM - $10MM.  This assumes we lose the entire contractual commitment.

Largest Exposure:  American Express - approximately $5.5 - $6.0 MM
Mass Market Customers: - approximately $1.5 MM

I am also anticipating additional credit related exposure.

We are assessing this exposure and will be determining how best to mitigate.

Beth,

Given our conversation two weeks ago, I want to keep the ball rolling at light speed.  Therefore, I would like to get together to walk through the action plan for the following:

Tariff - Flash to Actual
Intra-desk Settlements
Daily Tariff P/L
Update the wholesale equivalents to retail generation positions
Daily Price Curve changes by rate schedule
Daily P/L by utility rate schedule


I will ask my assistant to set-up this meeting for early next week.

Thanks

Jay

Can you confirm how many people are attending this meeting from our side.  It seems to be getting a little large and I think we need to make sure we are only bringing people that can add significant value to the actual meeting.

My count is as follows:

Marc Ulrich - URM - He is the commercial expert on ComEd and rate effects on our business - Mandatory
Jeff Merola - Manager of Physical Delivery Logistics for Central Region - mandatory
Brad Snyder - Structured supply 
Mark Bernstein - Structured Supply
Jeff Ader - Structured Supply
Janine Migden - Regulatory
Roy Boston - Regulatory
RogersHerndon - EWS Risk
Name I forgot - Legal - Ulrich recomended he go given the ComEd audience

This would be 9.  I think this is too much.  What are your thoughts?  

Given the agenda items of 1) ComEd PPO phase-out intentions, 2) Physical Delivery Issues and 3) Potential Business Transactions b/w ComEd and Enron, I think we need to trim the list of attendees.

I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   David worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.

In addition to Green Mountain, David has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions (San Antonio, misc. QSE contracts, etc.)

Gentlemen,

I am sending this e-mail as an introduction.  For background:

1)	I used to run the Continental Power and Gas group in London.  I now run Enron Metals and have no involvement in power.
2)	Rob Soeldner used to work for me on the Continent and in Metals.  Rob left Enron in January.  Rob is now the COO(?) of the NY ISO.  Rob has the enviable role of being the ex-Enron guy amongst a bunch of ex- Utility guys.  Rob thinks in an Enron manner and is looking to establish a formal relationship with some people on the power floor.  I was hoping to facilitate some brainstorming sessions.
3)	Kevin Presto has suggested that Tom May and John Llodra are the right people to contact.

I apologise.  I was supposed to make this introduction a few weeks ago.  Rob was trying to get in touch with someone from Enron last week.  I hope that this introduction will allow some conversations to begin.

Regards,

Joe Gold

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

Subject:	FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower


To all,

The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.  

Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.

Quick statistics for ONE site:

Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book.
Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).
Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.
Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.
All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.

Recommendations:

Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc.
In the interim:

Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.
Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book).
Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application.
Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).
Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. 	


Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:

Week 1 (May 14-18)

Read Contract.
Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc.
Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions.
Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.

Week 2 (May 21-25)

Continue working on Full Requirements model.
Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.	
Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.
Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.
At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.

Week 3 (May 29-June 1)

Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month.
Again, we ran into problems with the test database.
Completed booking in Enpower.

Week 4 (June 4-5)

Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.
Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

Elaine Schield, ENA Accounting, agrees that since 8% is what Kevin was promised we should use that going forward.  I will make the $492K interest adjustment in June business.

I just spoke with Kevin and he is certain that his deal on the interest was 8%.  What would the additional adjustment be if the interest were reset to 8% (as opposed to 8.5%)?  Would it be an additional adjustment of $218,000?  Please let me know so that Kevin can broach the issue with John.

I understand and agree with everything, except 8% was the agreed upon interest rate as noted on the economic runs which establised the demand payment between my book and New Albany, LLC.   It is clear that 8% was the agreed upon rate and the true-up needs to be from 9% to 8%.

Stuart - 

The approx $6MM of capital improvements were spent January thru June 2000.  The effect is an additional $1.2MM a year of depreciation for 2001.  I am not sure what Kevin is looking at, but Jenny's 2001 Plan had $17.4MM and we are currently forecasting $17.3MM for 2001.

With regard to the Capital Charge issue.  The interest rate that we were told to use by Delainey was 9% - we have since found out that Lavo is using 8.5% - therefore, in June we will credit the New Albany project with $218K of interest.  Again, Jenny's plan showed $11.8 and the 2001 forecast is $11.8(using 8.5%).  The estimate using 8% is $10.7MM.

Finally, there is only $54K remaining in New Albany's major maintenance account.  We stopped booking a per start accrual sometime last year on all of the Peakers since none of the plants except New Albany were using the reserve.  If my memory serves me correctly, Kelley Huntley and Jenny Latham met with Jody, myself and Scott Chambers in OEC to make this decision - and Jenny discussed it with Kevin.  There was nothing planned for major maintenance.

Please feel free to forward this on to Kevin so that he and Lavorato can resolve these issues.  Let me know if you or Kevin need any additional information regarding New Albany.

I am not sure if I mentioned the depreciation issue on the voicemail.  The issue is that there was an increase in the capital cost of the plant (due to additional upgrades and CAPEX that was done after Kevin's agreement with Lavo was cut).  This resulted in an increase in the actual depreciation figures.  Kevin feels that his original deal, based upon the cost of the plant at the time, should be honored.

Kevin -

Definitely get in touch with Mickey Ferrell (Ferrille?) Realtors - The McQueeney office (not the Seguin office).  The phone number is 830-557-5824.  Ask to work with Jackie specifically.  Jackie knows Elizabeth's family, The Otts, and me.  I am better friends with her husband - he drives boats and teaches kids how to ski for the Ski Lodge.

You will find a wide variety of homes on McQueeney.  The balance will be between location, lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be.  As for location, the prime areas will be:

1) Near the Lake Breeze Ski Lodge (near the Ott's house) 
2) Water front on and around "the Island"  (just as nice maybe nicer- more to choose from)
3) Waterfront "Up-River"  - Generally larger lots, less consistency in quality of homes

Expect values from $150 - $250k for a lot only.  houses will run from $350k - your limit.  Last time we were on the lake I noticed several new For Sale signs as you would expect.

The more I think about it, this lake is ideal for where you live.  It takes me 2:20 ish from my house and should take you no more than 2 hours from where you live today.

Let me know how things are going and if you are ever planning to head up there I will check my schedule and show you around if possible.  One thing to consider is going up on a Saturday morning and getting a room at The Lake Breeze Ski Lodge.  Drive around with Jackie during the am/afternoon and get Sambo (Jackie's husband) to take you and the family out on the boat for an hour or so (Sambo has a couple of Ski Nautiques).  The lodge has a great pool, bar, dining, and playground.  It is open weekends only through mid October I believe.  Open full time while school is out.  Rooms are about $65 and they are what you would expect.  A nice family/social place on the lake.  Of course, if we are there, we would be happy to take everyone out on the boats and such, but if we aren't everything is accessible through the lodge.

Good luck,

RH

Berney and I are having lunch with Edith today.  My plan is to only pursue a contract if she would commit to helping us work through the issues down here for a specified time (1 year) with the plan to then move her either into a commercial EES marketing role or back to ENE in a more commercial role.  If we do not get that commitment I do not feel that I should be the individual pursuing a contract.  I will provide you with feedback and direction after our lunch.

Kevin -

I had a discussion with Berney last night re: Edith.  I think we need to consider putting her under contract.  I would really like to try to entice her to help us for 12 months and I think if she were given some economic incentive or assurance we might have a chance.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is where she can add the most value to Enron.  Ultimately, I would like to be able to promote individuals like Edith out into the EES marketing/sales staff to represent Enron on the front lines commercially.

Despite where she goes, I think a contract is probably a wise move for Enron and always makes a person feel good and keeps them motivated.  Also, I think hearing some assurances from you and/or Lavo would probably be appropriate with her.   She knows how Berney and I feel but there is no real guarantee in our assurances yet.

Thanks,
Rogers



Another guy we need to think about is Mark Ulrich in the URM team - this guy is outstanding and I want to shield him from other parts of ENE.

Thanks Rogers.   I think Steve would fit in with our group well.   I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues.    My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable.

Kevin -
 
Just an FYI - Steve Marland resigned from Reliant very recently.  Steve had been trading their term Midwest book and has previously covered the SE I believe.  I think Steve is a good trader, played the regional/time spreads very effectively, and is not afraid to put size on when appropriate.  I just think that Reliant's management team is "old school" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions).
 
Steve just wanted to clear his head and get away.  He is looking at the opportunities everyone else is at the moment and is not in a rush.  I know he wants to work with a bright group that thinks the way he does.  I have told him that he should talk to you guys.  You may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ENE.  I have known Steve for awhile and think he could be a good fit - I think Fletch has met him and dealt with him in the markets as well.
 
Steve's cell number is 713-962-0274.  I know he would like to talk to UBS.

Subject:	NRC meetings

Kevin,
We are two months into the new contract and have not yet gone to any NRC
meetings.  There do not seem to be many that are significant.  I had been
expecting (and still am) that a meeting with Palisades ought to be scheduled
soon.  I even talked with one of the NRC staff to see if one was going to be
coming up.  Although the NRC said that there probably would be one, nothing
is yet scheduled.  I also expected a meeting to be conducted with Cook due
to the twin outages they are experiencing--but again, nothing yet.

There are a couple on the agenda now that may be of interest--certainly not
if we had meetings of real plant problems, but since we have now a contract
backlog of four meetings with two more for October, you might want us to
attend some of these meetings of lesser import.

1. 10/2/01 - A meeting with the public to discuss DOE's Tritium Production
Program.  DOE, NRC, and TVA (representatives from Watts Bar and Sequoyah)
will be conducting this meeting.  Since it is just a public informational
meeting, there will probably not be much new information given.  But I am
sure the public will have opportunity to ask questions, and if you have some
questions you would like me to ask, we could do that.

2. 9/26/01 - A meeting to discuss a revision to the NEI document outlining
the Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline of the Revised
Reactor Oversight Process.  Again, it is not something that we absolutely
need right now, and we should be able to get the final product later, but it
may be helpful to hear discussion so that we can determine what the NRC
concerns are and how they will be leaning in inspections.

3. 10/18/01 - A meeting with the commissioners to discuss regulatory reform.
This provides a higher level understanding of where the NRC is headed.  This
meeting may include discussion of new reactor construction.

That is it for meetings of any kind of interest.  If you want me to go to
any of these, please let me know.  You may want to save the meetings in case
things get hot and heavy later, but it's kind of doubtful that we would ever
exceed the number available especially now with a backlog.
Let me know.

Dan

I talked to him this morning and feels comfortable with his marks.   He is long, so he better.   Like I told you yesterday, I wouldn't hesitate to to be more aggressive on the front in ERCOT, particularly in the North where Doug is long.

I'll keep you posted.

FYI.

One thing to note is the recurring hammering I receive because we are uncompetitive in TX.  If Doug's curves are inacurate then we need to resolve.

Jay, our group has been literally blown out of the water with the commodity parcel approach as tested in the TX market this quarter.   It is very important that we schedule some dedicated time with Rogers to better understand our product limitations in the market.  I will look to you to arrange this.  

Instead of enabling larger deals through partial commodity master agreement placement, we have only succeeded in impugning the integrity of our larger offering.

Deals now wounded include:
ICI
Miller/Kraft
AGF
Crown Cork
Heartland (Collins and Aikman, Metaldyne)

MES has scheduled a 1/2 day offsite 10/16 with Blachman.  (Please set time aside to attend) Hopefully, Dave Delainey and Janet will also participate.  At that off site, the originators will present a comprehensive sales plan that effectively lays out the prospecting and closing process against approximately 50 companies over the next 5 quarters.  Efforts will be specifically delineated across commodity in places we have product, with milestones for master/confirm placement and associated gross margin (MTM), plus concurrent timelines for DSM as well.

All this means nothing if we continue to get hammered in the commodity marketplace, however.  If we cannot be competitive with either price or product structure, then we must once again rethink our macro approach to the market.

Miller has indicated to us this afternoon (informally) that our bid was not one of the top two they are considering.  Both Jeff and I are continuing to follow-up with Miller to see if there is anything we can do, but it appears our pricing fell short (we quoted $38.80/MWh, which was $1/MWh below the desk offer of $39.80).  Please call if you would like to discuss.

Thanks

Importance:	High

I spoke to Jeff Haggard.   Out of the 10 slots they rotate every 10 seconds, they can give us 7 slots.  This means that our ad will be on the site 70% of the time.  We can't take all 10 ads since they have to appear to be "fair" to other companies.

They are in a pilot phase and only doing this for 3 months for now.  This should be ok since they are willing to modify the  contract to reflect that we have first right of refusal if they extend the program.  We do risk any price increase after 3 months.  But, they are unwilling to offer a longer term than 3 months.  

They have verbally reserved the space for us for today.  Please approve the following cost asap so that I can finalize the contract with them before someone else takes the slots:

3 months x $500/mo x 7 ads = $10,500
Ad development cost:  Don't know yet (I would guess about $5,000, we can discuss)

Thanks.

Kal

After reviewing our position in more detail, we are quite long MWH's in the NE market, therefore the 5 year 7x24 PJM East bid (100-125 MW) would be closer to $4-5/Mwh below the current mid.  Additional purchases above 125 MW would be discounted further for VAR and liquidity reasons.

With respect to Florida, I would still pay the mid for Cal 02 (shaped like JEA short) and mid minus $2.00/Mwh for 50 MW of Calender 04-05.

As I mentioned in the meeting, EES/EWS would also provide a bid for ICAP/ancillary services in PJM and NEPOOL where the company has existing short positions.

Notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less.   Additionally, if we use them as sink when we go hourly, they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag.   If these issues are not crystal clear with them, I have no interest in even showing an offer.

TEA will let us go hourly 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly, as long as the source remains a unit on the Ga-ITS.  However, he doesn't want a full 50MW block in the June-Sept period, just 40MW.  The 40MW is actually already at the high end of his range (needs 30-40MW for June-Sep).

Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

Kevin,
 
Thanks for the return call today. Jess Hewitt returned a call I put into him this morning telling me that you would be the person I should talk to. I am the VP of Sales for Genscape, www.genscape.com << File: http://www.genscape.com/ >> , and we have developed a product which collects real time plant output data and sends that information real time to traders primarily in the short term power markets. Our product is currently being used and/or tested  at over a dozen top power trading firms in the US, and the response has been fantastic. 
 
There are other methods of receiving this information currently, but none of them are as fast and as accurate as the Genscape data, as we have set up proprietary monitors outside of the right of way on over 130 coal and nuke plants (primarily) nationwide and involuntarily capture their output data every minute or so, thus we can alert traders to plant outages or plants coming on or off line in real time.
 
I would like to discuss Genscape with you at your convenience, or if there is someone else inside UBS Enron to talk to please let me know who that person is. I can be reached at 502 583 4315. Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you.
 
 
Regards,
 
 
Mike McAuliffe

Fletch and I are dividing up Rogers postions (Fletch taking Peak, I'm taking Off-Peak).   To make it fair on everyone, I am allowing Rogers to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA.  (Rogers has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO).

In addition, I will be assuming all customer deals (VEPCO, JEA, Associated, MPMUC).

We will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where Fletch is comfortable taking the position (off-peak also needs to be marked down).  The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift.   All of Rogers postions will stay in Wholesale.

All parties come out with a fair solution.

Rika,
On Dec 3-4, 2001, there will be a conference on energy policy and regulation. 
Key speakers include:
Richard Meserve - Chairman of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
Pat Wood - Chairman of Federal Energy Regulatoy Commission (FERC)
Francis Blake - Dep. Secretary of Energy (US DOE)
James Connaughton - Chairman, White House Council on Environmental Quality
Jeff Bingaman - Senator and Chairman of Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
Carl Wood - Commissioner, California public Utilities Commission
and others

Topics include:
-New nuclear power generation in the U.S.
-Breaking the Nuclear waste policy logjam
-FERC policy for restructuring wholesale markets
-FERC policy for creating four mega-RTOs plus ERCOT
-National energy and environmental policy (Bush administration perspective & Congressional perspective)
-The future of state restructuring
and others

As you can see this is a major conference with a lot of key issues and a lot of key individuals delivering their views and leading discussions.  I think it would be beneficial for us to attend.  Again, since this is a conference rather than an NRC meeting, I would suggest the trade-off of us paying for flight, hotel, and all other expenses and time if you would pick up the conference cost ($1395.00 discounted "early bird" rate).
Let me know.
Thanks,
Dan

Mr. Presto,
I have the answer back from UBS PaineWebber on the reimbursement the fees
that you have been charged in the past on your options trades. Although I
did convince them to let us waive all future fees, it was pointed out to me
that it does say in your InsightOne Account Agreement under the paragraph
"Other Fees and Charges" that "With respect to aggregate trades of over
5,000 equity shares or 50 option contracts executed in the same security on
the same side of the market (buy or sell) on the same day, Client will also
pay $.02 per equity share on all shares over 5,000 and $2.00 per option
contract on all contracts over 50." Please give me a call if you have any
questions.

Thanks,

Hank Emery

As I discussed with Joe Deffner, the Duke transaction we recently completed (loan in a commodity deal), we were unable to get the "exception language" for collateral.   We did the transaction at LIBOR - 10bp and even when we add 65-75 bp for the cost of an LC, the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash.

The confirms we sent incorrectly placed the "exception language" and I am correcting that today.

Subject:	EPMI's FRCC membership

Dick Basford (formerly, a consultant for Enron on Florida matters) called me with a recommendation that EPMI withdraw from FRCC membership before EPMI is invoiced in February for $5750 (1/4 of annual dues of $23,000).  There is no pre-notice period for withdrawal and Dick feels that it would leave the FRCC relationship in a better light if EPMI withdraws, rather than not paying the invoice.  I tend to agree if EPMI has no further ongoing interests in trading in Florida.

UBS trading can make an application and join at any time, without an initiation fee.

Kevin/Paul--Is it ok for EPMI to withdraw?  If so, I'll draft the letter.  

Thanks.  Christi  37007

Kevin,

A few questions on UBS trading:

1.  What region will Lloyd Will be trading?

2.  Who should we set up power futures books for?!  (you, Fletch, Dana and Rob?)

3.  Regarding the Ontario curve, Stacey has held discussions with individuals in the Calgary office and it has been decided that Ontario trading will now fall under the realm of the Calgary office, not East.  As a result, East will not have "ownership" of the Ontario curve.  Is this your understanding?!

Last, I am attaching the original book list we had compiled for UBS before offers were declined, and I have highlighted in yellow the traders/books which are no longer going to the new company.  Could you please let me know if there will be someone else assigned to these books?!  Also, please point out any other modifications which you would like me to make regarding desk structure.   

Thanks!
Casey

Andy, this is some what short of the ENTERGY restrictions but still much to restrictive to allow effective parking.  TheFIST program has shown that they do not need these schedules until they reach implementation.  The utilities within the MISOare not showing Source and Sink .  They are using there own systems to hide there true S$S.  I do not think we should support this solution even if we can not get it changed.  It will undermind other efforts to eliminate the advance requirement for source and sink.

Yesterday, at the Midwest ISO, we successfully managed to quash the MISO's "at least one source-to-sink reservation" proposal.

MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on transmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was too restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point was too relaxed.  Their proposal was that "at least one" reservation on a tag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule would be denied for improper use.

Representatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with me to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the Entergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two conference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually pressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was unacceptable.  

The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:

	1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation specified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.
	2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the transaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will be approved
	3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will be denied

While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great deal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same time allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without a loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility within MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under the IRCA.  

This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy S/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are necessary.

As an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will allow for "partial" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate proposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is tagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change. 

A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached.  Proposal 4, Discussion item "Confusing POR/POD Naming," Discussion Item "MISO Proposal  ...time of scheduling," and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading.

Kevin,

I stopped by but I just missed you.  I will be in early Monday morning (to hopefully alleviate your work load).  Let me know if you want me to manage the stack first thing in the morning or if you want to transition it during the day. 

I realize things feel like shit right now (we sued Microsoft for breach of the contract) but we will turn this ship around. 

Hang in there.  

See you Monday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE
	LSE
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
	Other
3.	APX Agreement?
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

I've received interest from several potential sellers to fill the JEA position.  I sent the monthly on- and off-peak needs, requesting offers from the following:  Morgan Stanley, Orlando, Seminole, Calpine, Cargill, FPC, FPL, and FMPA.  I'll keep you informed as I receive responses.  Everyone expressed an extreme interest as they are all long power for the remaining term of this position.

Spoke to Lew at Morgan.  In summary, he's $1@$4 for this spread.  

He spent some time to explain why his market is not tighter.  Basically, the underlying philosophy of their shop is to NOT jump into the new, less liquid markets until they develop further.  They would almost rather see a few markets develop within the region, with high liquidity in each market (as opposed to many markets in the region, with low liquidity in each market).  My response was to be part of developing many market in the region, all with high liquidity.  But, in order to do so and help all the players in the market, we need other participants.

All that being said, his offer is $4 for the Cal'02, into SOCO/on Ga-ITS spread, 5x16.  I'm going to try some of the others (Williams, Dyn, Mirant may be players).

You are right.   They are on crack.   This would be at least $3.50/Mwh over Cin.   They have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is No. 2 oil.   Therefore, CPL East is a big premium Nov-Mar.   The bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk.

I think you forgot the cash position.  I would rather have on-line
valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.   I like to look at my personal
equity portfolio (includes Enron hedging) separate from Enron granted stock
and option value.

One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently.

      Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to
   me.
      The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total
   market
      value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get
      total
      portfolio value.

      I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was

         That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the

         The options are not valued properly.   The market value is
   calculated
         based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates
   the
         market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0)
   is
         valued OK, but the options are not.

         In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet
   in
         the portfolio.

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

Subject:	FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower


To all,

The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.  

Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.

Quick statistics for ONE site:

Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book.
Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).
Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.
Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.
All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.

Recommendations:

Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc.
In the interim:

Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.
Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book).
Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application.
Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).
Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. 	


Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:

Week 1 (May 14-18)

Read Contract.
Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc.
Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions.
Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.

Week 2 (May 21-25)

Continue working on Full Requirements model.
Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.	
Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.
Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.
At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.

Week 3 (May 29-June 1)

Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month.
Again, we ran into problems with the test database.
Completed booking in Enpower.

Week 4 (June 4-5)

Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.
Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

I think I could make a case for decreasing ECP, because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ECP (must run units for 6 hours etc.).   I would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at $100/Mwh.   This forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch.

We have seen what the additional peakers in the East does to volatility and energy clearing prices, in general.

What are your thoughts?

As reported in our last update, the NLRB ruled in favor of the Union, forcing Midwest to the table.
Negotiations start tomorrow (Wednesday).  This will be the first meeting.  
The second meeting is scheduled for Thursday.  After this, a more permanent agenda (meeting times and places) will be established by both sides.
The Union has established their list of "wants" in preparation for tomorrow's meeting.
By Friday the union will have the indications needed if meetings will continue.  
According to the Union:  Midwest is putting out false information which includes:  1) top individuals are on or have been on vacation and 2) that the Union has dropped all grievances.  Neither of these statements are true.
The matter between Midwest and Labor 15 is being handled out of the Chicago Regional Office of the NLRB or via the Peoria Sub-Regional Office.

No problem.   $0.50/Mwh is enough for this service.   You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh.   I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh, she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price.

Sound OK?

Kevin -

Billy closed this deal yesterday in the mid $70's.  i was planning on having Laura liquidate this position daily and pay her something like $1.00 per Mwh.   I would want her to liquidate daily and help me stay informed of what is going on down there and then reserve the right to sell for longer terms - if i say nothing the she would assume to continue to liquidate hourly.  However, my intent is to stay in tune with the market to maintain a good feel of issues in the South so i plan to speak to her daily.

Your thoughts?

Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio). =
  AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re=
al-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time ener=
gy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio=
.

Can we use their own testimony against them?

Subject:=09FW: SPP Retail Market Opening Testimony

AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) re=
tail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony=
 on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EP=
MI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that =
the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states =
have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (f=
or example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim st=
ates that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the mar=
ket, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail=
 market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than =
AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Te=
xas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the im=
balance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should =
be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies=
, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/0=
2 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.

Please make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports:

Remove ERCOT wind position completely from the report (PPA has been terminated)
Add ERCOT north zone positions
Add ERCOT south zone positions
Show separate positions for FL/GA border and FPL/FRCC
Add PJM-East positions (show separate from PJM-West)
Off-Peak position still shows SERC-FL (this location no longer exists) - Florida positions are either FL/GA or FPL/FRCC.

Kevin,

Iris Mack is planning to run an hour-long session on Mon, Nov. 5 (1:00-2:00) providing an "Introduction to Options". If successful, this will be followed up with further Monday sessions going into more detail and complexity.

I am planning to send an email out shortly to Origination encouraging people to attend. Would you like me to include Trading in the email?  Or would you like me to forward the text to you for forwarding to trading?

Theresa,
 
I think that it might make sense to visit briefly about your calculation.  As you mentioned, OEC is supposed to be paid certain amounts and will have various obligations to pay significant portions of the amounts paid to it to third parties.  In addition, the latest estimate of the costs to fix the Unit #3 generator is $1.45 million (without any reimbursement from insurance proceeds).  I just want to make sure that your calculation has everything in it because a few minor things have changed.
 
Finally, relative to the possibility of a third quarter close, we are at the mercy and timing of the FERC and cannot close without the required regulatory approval even if both Duke and Enron desire to do so.
 
Regards
 
Stuart

Stuart/Jon - I have updated the Loss calc for New Albany with actuals thru August.  Forecasted Loss is $1.1MM.  Please let me know if you have any changes to the reserve.  Any OEC costs associated with closing the facility will be accrued in September to the LLC and are not included as part of this calc.  Please call me with any questions.

Trey/Susan - I just found out yesterday that they are trying to close this next week - 3rd quarter deal.

Mark Haedicke is looking for an indication of the net settlement value to Enron from Calpine (apparently standard procedure for the settlement of lawsuits). David Portz is running the traps on this. I checked with risk mngt. to determine value of the cal '03 Nepool icap purchase. They couldn't find the deal. Can you give me a ballpark value ?
I'll be happy to pass the info. to Portz.

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

Kevin--Now that UBS is buying the gas and power business do you think that the gas and power groups will need someone (like me) to handle any physical or financial liquid fuel (resid and distillate) requirements for projects or daily business opportunities?

Are you a mind reader.   I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm (EB641) to go through East Positions (wholesale & T&D) and discuss process, deal review, big risk items, new deals, etc.  In attendance will be:

	Berney
	Busby
	Don Black
	Rogers Herndon
	Jay Lewis
	Joe Wagner
	Narsima Misra
	Jubran Whalan

I recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon).   I will assume Kim will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location.

Thanks for all the hard work and your efforts are greatly appreciated by the power desk.   Is there any chance I can talk you out of your resignation.   I would like you to come work for Lloyd Will and help with our services business and RTO interface initiatives.

We are in the process of completely revamping our systems, and your knowledge would be a huge help in pushing this initiative.   Your thoughts?

Kevin

Today at the Commercial Practices Committee (SPP) we voted to accept the draft real time market design for the "Day 2" market (i.e. 12/15/02).  This design, while not perfect, is in the direction of PJM.  As such it provides a real time market (yes you will be able to go long/short 10,000MW in real time!), with no penalties and no balanced schedule requirement.  Although control areas will be maintained, SPP will be the central dispatcher (the role of the control areas as of 12/15/02 has yet to be determined).  Moreover, the SPP real time market will probably be implemented by MISO and is being looked at by GridSouth.  Overall this is a pretty good outcome for both Enron and the market in general.

On a different note,  I provided Jim Steffes with my letter of resignation today.  I don't know whether or not I will be back in the office so I wanted to express what a pleasure it has been to work with (for?) you and the desk - I am very grateful for the confidence that you have shown in me.  My biggest regret is that the market design function didn't reside within your area of management rather than under government affairs.

If I can ever be of any help please don't hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards, Ron

Kevin,

FPC has indicated that it will be long 150MW beginning 1/1/02, as it has lost some of its Seminole load to Calpine (to a former FPC employee).  They are selling the 150MW of energy and capacity system firm (equivalent to FPC's native load), but will entertain firm LD bids.  They will sell smaller block sizes if necessary.  

When I get more info., I will discuss the opportunity further with you.

yes,

Edith was extremely pleased and just had a few questions on grants that I am following up on.  Presented Narsimha this am, asked him to read it and give me comments.  I think they were both very good packages.  I hope narsimha is pleased.  He is doing an excellent job as we all know, but I have talked to him recently about stepping up a little more, taking some major ownershi, showing leadership and digging into these position issues.  He has done great thus far, but that was the easy stuff really.  So, we will see how he responds - I think the package was very fair with continued upside.

I am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week.   It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract, so that is my challenge for the hourly group.   Having said that, I concur with your suggestions.

I am assuming you are presenting Narsima and Edith there promotion and contract packages.   Please confirm.

Kevin -

I spoke to Ed Baughman aearlier while on 31 and I wanted to follow-up with a comment on the SE Hourly group. 

I think those guys have done a pretty good job in the first half and have really made the effort to get to know their customers.  I thinkk Juan received a promotion and I hope he is going to get a decent bump in base with that.  However, I am not sure what the status is with Rudy and Miguel.  I think (not sure) that they are under contract and are probably paid a little light vs. the competition.  I would view the going rate for good hourly guys as about $85k based on what I have heard lately.  May stagnate a little bit with the outlook.

Do you think it is worth throwing these two guys a small incentive mid-year to let them know that we are aware of the competition and appreciate the work they are doing.  I am suggesting something small, around $5k each.  What do you think.  I know it is probably not a good day to discuss this but i think it is worth some consideration, and for all I know you have already addressed it.

Also, I would like to postpone our Monday meeting.  I have to interview someone and would like to get with Jay and Mark Jackson and then discuss RSO and T&D positions.

Garret Tripp would be better able to answer your questions for the Canada nuclear facilities.   With respect to forward hedging in the US, we have never seen British Energy hedge anything.   I believe they have transition contracts with the utilities they purchased the plants from.

I'm contacting you in the hope that you may be able to provide us with some info regarding British Energy.  I'm a trader on the UK Power Desk where BE are one of our major counterparties.  We are currently assessing what their strategy is likely to be in the UK and this depends in part on how profitable their US/Canadian assets are.  Do you have any insights on what they are up to in these markets right now - i.e how much of their output do you believe they have hedged forward and at what price ?  If BE succeed in restarting another 1600MW at Bruce is this likely to depress the market price there ? In general what do we believe the outlook to be for the US and Canadian markets.

Any info would be much appreciated !

Should you need to speak to me my phone number is +0044 207 783 6919

Many thanks

Calpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their c=

I wanted to give you a quick update on this.  After reviewing the various a=

for doing something with them was for us to receive a below mkt position fr=
om Calpine off of Dighton (so as to force Coenergy (gas supplier) to make a=
s large a termination pmt to Calpine as possible).  In return, we would pro=
vide some other form of value (e.g., low cost capital to facilitate re-fina=
ncing of Dighton once gas agreement terminated, we sell them a below mkt po=
sition in another region, etc.).   I floated this proposal verbally to Paul=
 Barnett about a 1-1.5 weeks ago, and his reaction was sort of "that sounds=
 interesting" but he didn't show a great deal of genuine interest.  I indic=
ated to him that I would work up a more specific written proposal.   Howeve=

Subject:	13MW in TECO

IMC Phosphate would like to sell us unit cont. power at their bus for December, 5x16., 13MW.  They are in TECO's service area.  We bought this from them in July and had full availability for all but 2 hours.  This was the transaction that Rogers took in his position but sleeved through your book.  Any interest here?

Subject:	Message from John and Louise - Enron Americas Management Offsite


Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).
Please find attached the following information: 
(i) Attendees and Teams for Video 
(ii) Draft Agenda 
Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) 
We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. 
John & Louise

Subject:	RE: Phoenix Q3 P&L Impacts

Terry -

I think you need to copy Mary Lynn Ruffer, Wes Colwell, Wade Stubblefield, Presto, Belden, Lavo, Berney on these updates please.  Jeff, Don - any others.

I am not sure I agree with Starwood.  If we are going to write down the option (currently at $6MM) to $2.5 MM then I will take it in my book at greater value based on what you described.  I think the negative impact should be no greater than $2MM.  Let me know if something new has come up that would change my outlook.

As for TYCO, I think the verdict is still out on this as well.  Some of the outstanding issues could reduce this negative somewhat.  We should have a better feel by Thurs.

Overall, I want to reflect fair value on the re-books, not extreme conservatism.  For example, on TYCO, I will not use NY Zone A for revenue purposes if the contract is unclear and does not force us to do this.  We need to recognize any "issues" like this but I do not intend to write down any deal to worst case economics.

Terry - you may want to give a range of reasonableness on these forecasts.

Thanks,
Rogers

Subject:	Phoenix Q3 P&L Impacts


I am currently building a spreadsheet to manage this information but know that it is important to get this out ASAP.  This is obviously very sensitive information, who should be copied?

These are the potential P&L impacts from Project Phoenix rebookings by the end of Q3:


			Gas		Power		Option		Total

Starwood						-4.5		-4.5MM

Chase					-20.0		+7.0		-13.0MM

Springs			+1.0		-12.0				-11.0MM

Tyco			TBD		-8.0				-8.0MM

	Total			+1.0MM	-40.0MM	+2.5MM	-36.5MM


You have each received the summary of issues with Starwood and Tyco.  A conversation regarding Springs is scheduled for this week.  Chase is a few days away but the magnitude of the impact is large enough that I wanted to highlight it now.  These are based upon best estimates to this point, I am attempting to establish the confidence interval on Chase and Springs power positions.

Hopefully we will be able to finalize rebookings of these transactions by the end of the quarter, along with MFG, Quebecor and Owens Illinois.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Terry

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.

Please ensure that real-time prices for ERCOT, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL are added to the cube database.   I have been analyzing the data today and the real-time clearing prices are not there.

I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.

Several names in my Lotus Address Book that did not transfer to the new Outlook platform.   The names that did not transfer have text next to them.   For exampe, Todd Rice did not transfer and his name on Lotus Notes has "Office Number" next to it.

There are several other examples of this.

Kevin -
 
Just an FYI - Steve Marland resigned from Reliant very recently.  Steve had been trading their term Midwest book and has previously covered the SE I believe.  I think Steve is a good trader, played the regional/time spreads very effectively, and is not afraid to put size on when appropriate.  I just think that Reliant's management team is "old school" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions).
 
Steve just wanted to clear his head and get away.  He is looking at the opportunities everyone else is at the moment and is not in a rush.  I know he wants to work with a bright group that thinks the way he does.  I have told him that he should talk to you guys.  You may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ENE.  I have known Steve for awhile and think he could be a good fit - I think Fletch has met him and dealt with him in the markets as well.
 
Steve's cell number is 713-962-0274.  I know he would like to talk to UBS.

Hi Fletch,


	Thanks for returning my call and for taking the time to look over this
cover letter with attached resume.  I should be heading out to the driving
range one of these weeknights. Drop me line if you're interested?

I'm looking for a position on the Enron energy trading floor. The personal
and professional qualities that make me a successful mutual fund wholesaler
will make me a strong contributor to your trading team.
	As my resume reflects, I have plenty of analytical skills combined with
hands-on  fixed income and equity trading. I have consistently grown
business because I pay attention to details and thrive in a fast-paced
environment. My experience and success in developing business has come about
through learning quickly, planning ahead, and working well within a team
environment.
I would enjoy answering your questions, and discussing how my skills and
experience could contribute to your team. Thank you for your interest in my
application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,



Dac Calderhead

I think they are low in FRCC by $1.00-1.50, and I will fix tonight.   The GTC and FL/GA marks are good.   On-Peak in FRCC, however, I will be moving down some, particularly in the shoulder months starting in 03 as alot of combined cycles are added in Florida by both utilities and merchant players.

Kevin -

Are you comfortable with your FLA off-peak marks?  When I look at them as relative basis values to SOCO/ENT they look ok, but when I look at them as rates they may appear low as that region definitely has some building to do and everything incremental should be gas.  They are probably fair - just wanted to check and see if you were comfortable.

Until we straighten this out internally we will just look ridiculous in front of the customer. Once again, this is an obvious wholesale product. I am happy to compete on price, the question is how much damage does this do externally.

Will you be available for the following visit?  This is another large group...  In order to keep this from being disruptive, we were thinking of dividing the group into two for two separate overviews.  These overviews should only be 10 minutes in length.  One would be at 11:00 am and the other at 11:15 am.

Let me know if this is a possibility.

Kevin -

NRG has agreed to release their transcripts to us in consideration of our agreeing to a propsed non-binding dispute resolution process.  In essence, we will exchange transcripts and position papers with NRG and we will have 10 days to review.  If we do not settle within that 10 day period we will enter into non-binding mediation in Chicago fbefore 12/15/01.  No legal action can commence until madiation concludes.

I am perfectly fine with this approach.  In my opinion, it signals a softening of their stance.  If mediation does not result in an acceptable outcome, or if their transcripts do not change our minds, all of our avenues are still open.

I am going to sign the letter on behalf of EPMI agreeing to this unless you have a problem (Andy has reviewed).

Thanks Chris.   I agree with the approach.   It would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the East and West trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything.

See you tommorow.

Subject:	Plan

Guys,

I gave Louise  a"plan" which consists of trading list, transmission list, gant chart, org charts and your product descriptions.  I did not include any "strategy" or "volume targets" in the plan - my thought is we have a lot of work to do and we'll get after it.  I told her that the lists are works in process and will be modified or re-formatted since they will become our working tools for getting this stuff done.  Kevin,  I will be in Houston tomorrow if you want to review any of this.  Lists are unlikely to be perfect but they demonstrate that we have spent some time on this and we have a starting point.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Rika,

Please assign an analyst to show all generation in the Com-Ed control area.   The primary owners are:

	1)  Edison International (former Com-Ed coal plants)
	2) Com-Ed (nuclear and some GT's)
	3) People's (Elwood and one other merchant plant)
	4) 5-6 miscellanious merchant plants (includes Allegheny's Lincoln Center facility)

Kevin and Rika -

We are preparing for a negotiation with ComEd this Friday pertaining to their filing to accelerate the termination of the PPO (Purchased Power Option) rate schedule we currently utilize to serve our customers.  In its absence we would have to roll over to a much higher priced BBR (Bundled Rate) or Physically serve.  Our position is that physical delivery in ComEd is not really open access - primarily due to the fact that 1) the rules have not been spelled out clearly and 2) there is a concentration of power re: ancillary services in the hands of the generators in ComEd's territory.  

Do we have a map or a list of all of the generation in the state (and specifically in the Chicago area) by fuel type and by owner?  We want to be able to show concentration of these assets in the hands of the few.

Our meeting is Friday and this analysis would be huge (our $$ exposure to their proposal is significant) in our negotiation.

Please let me or Mark Ulrich know if there is any way you could assist us.

Thanks,
Rogers

Yes, you are correct.   Todd is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan.

With respect to your latest Contract, I have 2 minor changes.  The only one with any significance is the counterparty name.   I expect Mitchell-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement.   Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract.

I want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations, much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty.

The other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent.

Talk to you soon.

I don't agree with either 7 or 8.   The 0.1 LOLP generally results in 20-25% reserve margins which are excessive.   Reserve margin is a meaningless measure in an efficient commodity market because supply and demand adjust to price signals to keep the market in balance.

My view is that ICAP should be eliminated completely and, if utilized, transitional only for a 1-2 year period.   The other alternative is the ISO to have a reliability auction whereby quick-start units contract directly with an ISO for meeting reliability reserve reqs.

In summary the paper presents 14 principals for assuring adequate capacity that I believe Enron could support.  Most of the principals discuss a liquid, efficient energy market and robust forward markets are capable of assuring adequate capacity; load needs to see prices and demand needs to respond; barriers to construction of new generation and entry for LSE's need to be eliminated; and any capacity market must be designed to create a level playing field between old and new market entrants.  The most controversial are #7 and #8.  

Number 7 states:

"During a limited transition to fully competitive markets, an administratively-determined mandatory reserve requirement can serve to ensure that adequate capacity is available to meet reliability needs within politically acceptable limits of price volatility.  A mandated reserve requirement should be tied to specific reliability criteria for that system, such as the one day in ten years loss of load probability."
 
Number 8 states:

"Suppliers must be fully compensated for supplying needed reserves.  This can be accomplished through a well-designed Installed Capacity (ICAP) market, a separate capacity market, imbalance trading or call options."

My recommendation is that Berney's retail structuring group value the generation deals that are intended to serve retail load.

Berney -
 
As we have mentioned in the past, York has no significant strategic value to the retail business.   The plant is located in PJM - West Hub, one of, if not the most, liquid, transparent and retail friendly supply location.  Bring us another deal with legitimate due diligence in PJM - East or Zone J/G and we could attribute some strategic value.  We have more than generously valued this generation and it does not interest me from a VAR allocation standpoint or otherwise..
 
Regarding our role in these generation efforts - I view them as minimal, but it is obvious they see differently.  I do not anticipate that our book will acquire generation but I am not sure if we need to staff up to handle this vs. distracting our regional structures with these efforts on an as requested basis.  One suggestion would be to have wholesale structuring price up these projects.  The drawback there is that we have most of the experts and Bernstein & Co. want to value ancillary adders etc.
 
Kevin, what are your thoughts?

2 issues: 

1) Bernstein has asked us to comment on the strategic value of their York proposition. Apparently, he has revisited the Fixed O&M assumptions with Virgo and the new numbers have him close to where our mid would be (approx. $22 million). Once again, we are representing our valuations based on limited information and NOT full pro-forma economics. I've suggested to Bernstein to talk to Don Miller's group for an exit strategy in case the buy this thing. (i.e., Alamac structure) Anyway, it leads to my next question.

2) If I'm asking this for the hundredth time, I apologize BUT: Do I need to staff up to accommodate "generation-based" pricing in our shop? Bernstein has asks me to facilitate getting access to structuring models to do their own notional pricing on deals. We need to address two possible scenarios:

They have access to structuring models but need access to curves in order to price their deals. In theory, they can use the precedent within EES that Orig/Product Development does their own notional pricing before going to Deal Mgmt./Structuring for Executable pricing. 
They come to us for notional pricing. If this is the answer, I need to add to my staffing needs to accommodate this service. 


Rogers, I'm indifferent as to which scenario is the "right thing to do" because I'm operating on the notion that we will not be managing the commodity risk associated with their deals. If this has changed, maybe both scenarios above are necessary to accommodate these value propositions.

I do realize the fact that our current retail systems can't accommodate spread options or even report the simple Greeks off of a straight forward Fixed Strike Euro, but we can handle this later if we are to warehouse this risk. I think you and I need to have clarity on this issue as we are getting more request to support that business.

Thx

Sounds like he might fit in the LMP/transmission/congestion management group.   As I mentioned, we are attempting to create an Eastern Interconnect LMP model to model congestion in every region.   This will lead to the creation of hubs and basis markets.

Ravi might be a good fit for this group.

Kevin,

Here is the scoop on Ravi:

- He has extensive technical and financial modeling experience that would be an asset to the group.
- He would like the opportunity to using modeling (artificial intelligence, etc.) to realize arbitrage opportunities.  He has spoken to John Arnold and the crude desk about doing some variation of the above.  
- He is not ready to sit down in a trading seat day 1, however he is interested in getting to learn the commodity via research and modeling with the opportunity to move into trading.  

What are your thoughts?

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.


David: 

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.

As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.
The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market
value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total
portfolio value.

I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate.

   That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the
   Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the cost

   represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does that
   make

   The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated
   based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the
   market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is
   valued OK, but the options are not.

   In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in
   the portfolio.

Yes we need PRB 8400 and PRB 8800 curves.   My agreement with EGM was coal curves in exchange for power curves.

Heather - If I don't get the PRB coal curves by the end of this week, I will have to remove access to our power curves.

In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.  It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.   Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.

The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.

Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly.

We have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor.   I think its important to put all power related retail functions (risk management, tariffs, structuring, risk reporting, etc.) on the 5th floor.

If you do this, then there will not be room for the retail gas group, which means you need to work with Tammy Shephard and Wes Colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas.

Kevin,

Hello!  I hope you will remember me from the EPP days.  You may be aware that I joined the Research group here in Houston in February.

You maybe aware that Stinson Gibner who was in the Research group left late last month, and I am now taking over some of the things he was earlier looking into.

One of those is trying to get a good feel for how well your group is being supported by Research, and to provide timely help where needed.  Whenever you have a moment, I would like to meet with you or anyone you designate to get a better idea for your needs and also collect any feed back that you may have for me.

Hi Kevin.  I just got your email and tomorrow I will be at Enron Field for  
the Astros game.  I try to be as flexible as possible for meetings and  
usually try to schedule them in the evenings or on weekends; whatever is most  
convenient for you. 
I anticipate getting home late tomorrow nite and will call you Wednesday  
evening if that is alright.   
I look forward to meeting with you and working with you on your new home. 
Thank you for your consideration.

The following information is from a Union source:
Union planning to go on strike at 6am tomorrow morning  (1200 employees of which 250 are Management)
The current shift is the last prior to the strike
Meeting continue today and through out the night
A Federal mediator has been bought in to try and help the situation
The only way the Union won't go on strike is if there is a tentative agreement in place with Midwest, however, everyone involved feels these chances are slim 
When a strike occurs, it will affect 7 plants

Kevin -

Very sensitive info.  I asked Kristin to gather info on Select so that I could look into hiring some of their better people.  I am trying to get a more complete org picture but plan on contacting these individuals.  I will funnel the customer feedback through the appropriate channels.

Rogers, 

Per our conversation on Select Energy and their ventures in aggregate power transactions, we have gathered the following data:

The key individuals overseeing Select Energy's aggregate power sales are Robert Porter, Director of Sales & Marketing (principal contact) and Terry Ranger, Manager of Contract Fulfillment (contract faciliatator).

Select Energy offers aggregate power buyers bundled services such as power supply, risk/supply management, and distribution at a fixed price.

A source at the Massachusetts Health & Educational Facilities Authority commented that Enron was recently out-bid by Select Energy because Enron's terms: 

	*  failed to include supply to smaller lab facilities requiring only 8MW
	*  offered only a 4.5 minute window of opportunity to strike on the quoted price & was inflexible when the hospital asked for time to coordinate with their several non-	   profits
	* offered a price higher than Select Energy

We will continue to retrieve information and finalize our findings for presentation in a company overview.  Please call with any questions.

Thanks, 
G. Britt Whitman  ex:54014

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition  Conference

Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami,  Florida

 

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

March  26-28 2002,  Atlanta, Georgia

 

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will highlight the commonalties and  common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the  enterprise.  The conference will  emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management  processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing  process.  The processes of Asset  management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the  long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term  perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link  short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to  show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in  order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset  owner.

Ancillary  Services Conference

 

April  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.

 

The brochure for the Ancillary Services  Conference, April 10-12, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link  below:<http://www.euci.com/pdf/anc_svcs.pdf> << http://www.euci.com/pdf/anc_svcs.pdf >>

Rika,
The meetings are starting to be more substantive.  I'm listing four meetings
here along with Fred's recommendations:

Following Fred recommends attending:

1. 11/8/01  NRC staff assessment on vessel head penetration nozzle cracking.
At meeting will be Nuclear Energy Institute and several PWR licensees.  May
get insight to several plants outage plans.

2. 11/9/01  Discuss TMI steam generator severed tube discovered during
refueling.  Could provide upcoming outage plans and industry plans for steam
generator integrity.

3. 11/15/01  Management meeting with Watts Bar to discuss plant performance
and refueling outage plans.

Following Fred does not think is worth it:
1. 11/13/01  Ginna (NYPP) evaluation regarding potential for circumferential
cracking of reactor vessel head penetration nozzles.  Possible insight to
refueling plans.

I need to know soon since the first one on the list is tomorrow.
Thanks,
Dan

Kevin,

In connection with Lisa's preparation of the FASH for this transaction, she has asked whether there are any "hedges" that need to be unwound.  I told her that from our conversations, I was of the opinion that there were (approx. $5,000,000 in costs associated with the unwind).  Please confirm.

Kevin:
As we work to improve to our fundamentals, one of things we'd like to include is off-peak prices. We have a weekly production / burn report . Can I have acess to these prices? Who should I contact?
Also can i have access to the power structuring model and curves?
Thanks

What is the exact delivery point?   Does it include capacity?   Is it a daily call?   monthly call?   All options are quoted by Harry Arora.

Are you interested in offering the $100 daily call, into Duke, May-Sep'02, up to 100MW?  We may be able to separately offer regulatory capacity off of the Carolina plants we sold to AIG.

Kevin,

Who now handles Duke's system territory with King switching to ERCOT?  You or Fletch?

North Carolina Mun. Power Agency 1 has informally requested up to 100MW of capacity and energy for May-Sep'02 with a "relatively high" strike price (probably $100) into Duke, or regulatory capacity.

Formally, they have issued 2 RFP's:  1) to buy as much as 750MW of intermediate, peaking, and reserve capacity for summer peak months of 2003 and beyond (1-5 years), increasing by approx. 25MW per year; 2) to sell up to eight, 50MW blocks of 7x24 energy, system firm or unit contingent, off of Catawba and/or McGuire nuclear plants, interconnected with the Duke trans. system, beginning 1/1/03 (1-8 year term).

Terry Donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence.  Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefits of joining this effort?

The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management process from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the senior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findings.

This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be appreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help.  


Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is leaning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (and also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.

Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring and was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walking away from his commitment to structuring.  By the time he left he was almost ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more.  He is definitely someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.

Berney -

A heads up - Bernstein is working on a supply deal with Constellation.  I am told it is the same as Alleghenny but have not seen.  I think they are still working on language, etc., but I get conflicting signals as I think they are already talking pricing - who knows.   I am not even sure what regions - these guys are operating in stealth mode as usual.  

I have reiterated to Deb Merrill and Janet that these deals need to come through the traditional sales channels once the Master and Confirms have been agreed to (we need to be comfortable with Master and Confirm before any pricing is contemplated).  Specifically, we need to make sure that 1)  Legal provides us a detailed gap analysis between contracts (purchase vs. sales), 2) all pricing comes through traditional channels (deal mgmnt/commodity structuring), 3) we know exactly how this is priced in relation to mid-offer, consider residual desk risk and 4) most importantly, we need to know exactly what type of orig. is being anticipated.  On the last point, I do not contemplate granting any orig for supply marked above our mids.  My view on this is that if they want to bring in supply between our mid-offer, they can sell this supply directly to customers, I do not plan to manage the risk.

Please let me know when you begin hearing about this.

Thanks,
Rogers

Sounds good.   We may want to consider diesel installation for Lincoln Electric as well.

I am beginning to think that diesel installations is our primary solution to cover OPPD short for May-Oct 02.

Per Gary Hickerson & Kevin McGowan, EGM agreed to make all coal curves (including PRB) available to power desk if we provided the power curves to the equity group.   Therefore, please ensure we receive this info in a timely manner.

Edison International purchased all of Com-Ed's gas and coal plants approx. 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-Ed through 2004.

The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found.   I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback.

Kevin,

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

Someone from the Marcus Evans training company was looking for an Enron person to attend a course on Generation Asset Valuation and Optimization. A brochure describing the course content and instructors is attached as a PDF file at the bottom of this message. Brian Stanley agreed this looked like an informative event, so we committed a slot for Enron among the approximately 25 participants. We'd like you to suggest who would be the best person to represent Enron in this session.

These courses are interactive and are geared to executives. (Per course brochure, audience is CFO, Sr. VP Generation, VP Asset Mgmt, VP Power Supply, VP Development, Director Market Analysis/Valuation.) Companies represented for this one include Ameren, Cinergy, Duke, Exelon, etc.  The course is being held Oct 1-2, 2001 in the Crowne Plaza, just down the street from our office. The cost would be about $3,600.00. EEOS has paid the fee to hold a place.

The course seems focused on making complex decisions about assets in light of uncertainty and volatility, which might be of some value in assisting ENA with strategy about potential acquisitions. Also, we would get some exposure to what other players in the market are thinking. One speaker is the Sr. VP of Asset Management for Duke Energy North America.

Some suggested criteria for the candidate to attend:

1.   Involved in decisions about valuing Generation Assets based on uncertain future outcomes as opposed to simple discounted cash flow analysis.

2.   Interest in calculating value of asset flexibility, e.g., alternate transmission paths, fuels, etc.

3.   Able to discuss merits of asset ownership vs. other means of access to asset/output (contract, lease, etc.)

Kevin, Don and Mike, I think any of you might find this worthwhile if you have the time. I also would suggest perhaps Mitch Robinson as one who is very clued in on both asset management and how we are using assets (owned by us or others) as part of our business. But I don't know everyone on your side, so I request that you consult with each other and let me know whom you think should attend.

(If for some reason you don't want to send someone, we can cover it from the Operations side at EEOS.)
 
Call me at x6-7775 if you have questions.

Thanks.
Ken

I am interested in lakefront property on Lake Travis which is within 3 hour drive of Houston.   Given the technology sector meltdown, I am looking to "bottom fish" for lakefront property that provides great long term real estate value.

Please feel free to e-mail me with "value" opportunities that come up.   I did not find your CD-ROM user friendly and I prefer e-mails with attached property listings that meet my requirements.   I am looking to spend 200-250k for lakefront property that has previously sold in the 275-325k range.

thanks.

Please call with any questions.   I feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this.

Subject:	Support of PJM's Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO

As I mentioned to each of you today, we plan to sign Enron's name as a member of the "One RTO Coalition" in support of PJM's proposal for developing a single Norhteast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market in the Northeast.  PJM's proposal is attached.  As you may recall, I gave you a copy of PJM's proposal and we discussed it when I was in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  The main concern with PJM's proposal is its timing -- their time line provides for an implementation date of November 2003.  We have talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation process, and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively, but they are unwilling to change their target date in their proposal.

Because we disagree with the PJM date, we propose to have Enron Power Marketing, Inc.'s name included on the list of supporters of the proposal, with the following footnote:

	While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance of PJM's proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein, Enron 	Power Marketing, Inc. dissents from PJM's date of November 2003 for implementing the single RTO in the Northeast.  Enron believes that the PJM proposal 	can and must be implemented by December 2002 and that extension of the implementation date past December 2002 is unnecessary and contrary to the 	Commission's RTO policy established in Order No. 2000.

This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJM's timing in comments to the Commission after the Judge submits his report (due on September 17).  In those comments we can go into much greater detail about the need for quick implementation.

Please let me know if you have any suggested changes to the footnote or if you disagree with our proposed strategy.  We will address this issue on Thursday at mediation (I thought it was going to come up today, which is why I called each of you), so if you have any comments or concerns, please let me know as soon as possible. 

Thanks

Sarah

Looks like Ader & Co. at work in ERCOT.   I view this as a big problem.   These customers need to be covered by wholesale.   Both of you should take this as a slap in the face.

Tom,
Will you be available for the following visit?  This is another large group...  In order to keep this from being disruptive, we were thinking of dividing the group into two for two separate overviews.  These overviews should only be 10 minutes in length.  One would be at 11:00 am and the other at 11:15 am.

Let me know if this is a possibility.

Thanks.
Jennifer

Enron Host:	Michelle Robichaux, Representative National Energy Sales

Value Prop:	EES is looking to provide electric commodity savings off the PTB for an aggregated load of 70 Texas municipals.

Objectives:	I would like CAPP to leave knowing just how different Enron is from its competitors.  This would include Enron's risk management expertise and size and scope of marketing of gas power and other commodities.

I assume we are doing everything necessary to insure that we will have all of our customers switched for 1/1/02.  If anyone knows any different then please speak up now.  In all seriousness, we cannot accept mistakes or slip-ups on this one.  The pilot transfers appear to have been much more difficult than I would have anticipated.

Does everyone have the info they need?
Who is communicating with the ISO?
DO we have all of the data we need for the customers?
What are the deadlines for notification?
Does this group feel we need to get together to discuss any open issues?

Please let me know if anyone feels uncomfortable with our getting there.

Thanks,
Rogers

Changes from last week in red.

Retail load
About 18 MW peak, 17 MW off-peak. 
October 4th - First account was switched. 
By November 6th - Remaining accounts will be switched
Issue - Some Lockheed Martin accounts that aren't in the batch.
Issue - Trying to get positions correctly reflected in positions report - Jeff Jackson
Issue - Data we are getting from RPS is incorrect.

Interface with EWS Wholesale
To date - Met with EPMI and discussed management (when will position be transferred? how? at what price?) of retail position. Tom May to discuss with Rogers. 
Issue - How will we pass through intrazonal congestion costs? This isn't an issue for the pilot, but will be an issue on 1/1/2002.

Intramonth book development
November 1 - Expect to have volume management/reporting capability. 
November 1 - Expect to have MTM calculations
???- Expect to have all other reporting capabilities functioning. Will meet with Richard Bird this week to develop a new timeline.

Working with CSC to develop a method to obtain actual customer usage on a timely basis.

Load forecasting
Issue - There is a significant difference (at least in % terms) between the Packaged Ice position per the positions report and Frazier's forecast. Appears the majority of this difference is due to some Packaged Ice accounts being booked more than once.
Issue - Forecasting by zone (vs. at the account level) may lead to inaccuracies in P&L reporting.

?	Customer switching process
Jeff Merola to determine roles and responsibilities

?	Site profile
Site profile desk has processed the pilot program deals. 
Met with the desk to discuss the other (non-pilot program) deals that we expect to switch 1/1/202.

Kevin,
 
  I didn't get the chance to say goodbye or  good luck since you were not at your desk. I just wanted to thank you for giving  me the chance to work at Enron, which is (was) a special place with unique and  talented people. Your insights , management style and market  intelligence are second to none in the trading community. I hope you can keep  your core group together and not be smothered by another organization that can  only think "inside the box". Good luck.
 
  Regards, 
                  Joe Quenet.
 
PS Tell Dave Ryan to take me off the distribution  list for European evening updates. I don't really care about that stuff anymore.

Importance:	High

Kevin,
I have been asked to assign priority regarding Enpower and the PortCalc output.  The issue is that the heat rate swaps send info to the VAR calc under the wrong risk type, misstating risk.  In essence, the price/basis decomposition isn't happening, so risk is misstated. (potentially grossly misstated, pending book and quantity.

Do you want this completed ASAP, or do you want it to wait in cue pending other projects?

Frank

Dear All,

	For the Heat Rate Swaps, we have gone through the PortCalc program and confirmed that it is using the combined NG price and Basis for the calculations, it is not an easy task to split the calculation and store the results separately, please let us know if this is of utmost importance and shall be prioritized accordingly.

	Regards,


Norman.

Subject:	Good Bye

As most of you already know I am leaving Enron after five years to go to Harvard MBA School.  My times at Enron have been beyond the expectations that I had when I stepped into trading hourly power at odd hours of the night  when  I first became an Enron analyst.  Since the very beginning, Enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself.  No other company would have given those chances at such a young age.  I like to think that I repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving Enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been.  

Even though I contemplated several other opportunities to leave over the last five years, I never left for another company.  I came to realize that the people that work here are the best, and I have always strived to be among the best.  Aside from the professional skills and energy, the people here have become good friends of mine.   Enron is among the best corporations in the world because of the high quality of people that we have attracted over the years.

Special thanks to Jim Fallon, Jeff Golden, Mark Muller, Dave Delainey, Kevin Presto, and Rogers Herndon, all of  whom have provided me direction and excellent leadership during my time here.

Please find my forwarding email address, phone numbers, and address.  If any of you need anything or come to Boston please look me up, I will always buy the first beer!  Good luck to you all.

Your friend,

John

Remember our deal.   After trading day is over (for next 2 months), you stay until the risk calcs are done and help in whatever manner is necessary to improve the process.   In addition, you should take responsibility for calcing the ERCOT books (term and cash).

Are you interested in bringing JT back from broadband into a logistics or cash trading role? I'm hearing EBS may shut it down this month. I think JT would add significant value in east power. Let me know.

I need 2 additional tickets for the Washington game that are next to my 4 season tickets.   I will call you later today to give you my AMEX to get the parking pass and confirm the specific seat location.   Patrick never called me to confirm the seats in the front row of the upper section, therefore, your message is the first confirmation I have received.

Kevin,
 
I got your message  today regarding the invoices that you have received for tickets.  I am  sorry I didn't have a chance to call you back.
 
The only invoices  that you should have received recently are for the 6 Washington tickets and the  SVIP parking pass.  I faxed these to you about a week  ago.
 
As part of your  membership at the Golden Cane level, you are entitled to 4 complimentary season  tickets.  Based on your conversation with Patrick, these are going to be  located in the section in front of the press box reserved for Golden Canes and  Living Scholars.  Your parking pass and any additional season, home or away  game tickets would need to be purchased.
 
Please let me know  if you have any additional questions or concerns.  Thank you, once again,  for continued support of the Hurricane Club.

I think that it might make sense to visit briefly about your calculation.  As you mentioned, OEC is supposed to be paid certain amounts and will have various obligations to pay significant portions of the amounts paid to it to third parties.  In addition, the latest estimate of the costs to fix the Unit #3 generator is $1.45 million (without any reimbursement from insurance proceeds).  I just want to make sure that your calculation has everything in it because a few minor things have changed.
 
Finally, relative to the possibility of a third quarter close, we are at the mercy and timing of the FERC and cannot close without the required regulatory approval even if both Duke and Enron desire to do so.
 
Regards
 
Stuart

Stuart/Jon - I have updated the Loss calc for New Albany with actuals thru August.  Forecasted Loss is $1.1MM.  Please let me know if you have any changes to the reserve.  Any OEC costs associated with closing the facility will be accrued in September to the LLC and are not included as part of this calc.  Please call me with any questions.

Trey/Susan - I just found out yesterday that they are trying to close this next week - 3rd quarter deal.

Maybe.   If we truly believe this is a credit starved industry with huge liquidity problems, then we should be able to dictate the terms for dealing with a AA entity........ end of story.
 
We should send this message early and often.   If we don't, the market will percieve that negotiating "one-off" terms for trading docs is acceptable.   I disagree with this approach from a long term philosophical standpoint.   We either believe our bullshit or we don't.

Kevin, 

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

We need to add Jay Lewis and 4-5 people with T&D tariff knowledge to the curve team as well.   This process will entail specific wholesale curves plus a complete review of the T&D tariff curves.

These teams need to work together to ensure the sum of the parts equal the whole.   I am assuming everyone on the team agrees.

Kevin this is the forecaster with an attitude.

Sounds like he has a fair amount of drive and would fit in well at Enron.

I have been emailing Craig once a week until I heard from Gerald who I have a lot of faith in as far as reference as I did not want to inherit a problem PHD.  I have asked research (Vasant) to check him out as well.

I believe that this cat might be what I need to get the forecast Rogers and Services need for our wholesale to retail delivery amounts with limited or no metering.  I would have him work on a project that uses the metering we receive to forecast Rogers wholesale delivery requirements hourly.

I will proceed to bring him in unless I hear otherwise from you.

I am on Craig's committee and worked with him for two years (1999-2000)
through his major professor, Eric Bartlett.  I think that Craig is a
self-starting person, familiar with neural networks and statistics.  He has
done a good job with programming on the internet and is very interested in
forecasting.

I think that with the right opportunities, he will do very well.

Kevin -

Definitely get in touch with Mickey Ferrell (Ferrille?) Realtors - The McQueeney office (not the Seguin office).  The phone number is 830-557-5824.  Ask to work with Jackie specifically.  Jackie knows Elizabeth's family, The Otts, and me.  I am better friends with her husband - he drives boats and teaches kids how to ski for the Ski Lodge.

You will find a wide variety of homes on McQueeney.  The balance will be between location, lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be.  As for location, the prime areas will be:

1) Near the Lake Breeze Ski Lodge (near the Ott's house) 
2) Water front on and around "the Island"  (just as nice maybe nicer- more to choose from)
3) Waterfront "Up-River"  - Generally larger lots, less consistency in quality of homes

Expect values from $150 - $250k for a lot only.  houses will run from $350k - your limit.  Last time we were on the lake I noticed several new For Sale signs as you would expect.

The more I think about it, this lake is ideal for where you live.  It takes me 2:20 ish from my house and should take you no more than 2 hours from where you live today.

Let me know how things are going and if you are ever planning to head up there I will check my schedule and show you around if possible.  One thing to consider is going up on a Saturday morning and getting a room at The Lake Breeze Ski Lodge.  Drive around with Jackie during the am/afternoon and get Sambo (Jackie's husband) to take you and the family out on the boat for an hour or so (Sambo has a couple of Ski Nautiques).  The lodge has a great pool, bar, dining, and playground.  It is open weekends only through mid October I believe.  Open full time while school is out.  Rooms are about $65 and they are what you would expect.  A nice family/social place on the lake.  Of course, if we are there, we would be happy to take everyone out on the boats and such, but if we aren't everything is accessible through the lodge.

Good luck,

RH

Subject: Midwest Update



Back in May the MidWest regulatory team received two instructions.  Firstly, build a market in the MidWest that uses LMP to clear real time settlements and secondly ensure that that there is one market operator/RTO (i think the phrase was 'kill the Alliance' or something along those lines...).

The strategy we have, and continue to employ to achieve this is twofold: 
- work with the MISO to reshape its day 2 congestion management proposal based on the above instructions.  The MISO is currently proposing a market design consistent with that set out in May (a strawpaper will be circulated in October that i will send around for comment).

- marginalise the Alliance proposal by focusing on its governance structure (all decision rights held by incumbents) while educating stakeholders on the benefits of moving to a more transparent market platform such as that proposed by MISO.  Alliance is currently imploding; one member has left (Detroit Edison) and five are rumoured to be considering their options (Consumers follow DTE to MISO and VEPCO, FE, Comed/Exelon and AEP to PJM).  It is unclear whether these rumours have much basis but as a result of the recent flurry of filing (and more importantly protest) activity, it is clear that the Alliance proposal is totally unacceptable to all stakeholders.

In the last 2 weeks, Enron responded to the following filings: 
- MISO and Alliance 120 day compliance filings. 
- Alliance business plan. 
- National Grid proposal to become Alliance managing member. 
- ITC (Detroit Edison) joining MISO. 

To summarise these pleadings Enron asked FERC to mandate 1 RTO in the MidWest and set out the its favored governance and market structures (there was a high degree of support from all stakeholder groupings although Enron was the only party to ask for this guidance directly).  On Wednesday FERC took a step in this direction, stating that it wanted a standard market design throughout the US (FERC is believed to support PJM) and that the MidWest structure warranted direct attention in the near future.  Alliance stakeholders took a further step by voting to suspend Alliance market development activities and fold these activities into the MISO process to ensure consistency across the region.

We are also working on further responses to the Alliance 120 day compliance, the MISO/Alliance generator interconnection and a similar intervention in the Indiana state proceeding for transfer of assets to the RTOs to add further weight to Enron's arguments.

So we are seeing action as a result of consistent pressure.  I am now comfortable saying that we are close to achieving the goal (but the fat lady hasn't started her last stanza yet, the Alliance will likely continue to wriggle a little in the coming months )....the downside being that and there is a high probability that the combined MISO/Alliance RTO) will not begin operations on 12/15/01.  So the task in the next month will most likely change from beating up on the incumbents to reconciliation in an effort to get one functional RTO in the MidWest as quickly as possible.

regards 
Mike

Rika,

Wanted to give you some updated thoughts. We normally do not gyrate this
much, but much uncertainty and volatility now.

Firstly, we are writing down demand sharply in the U.S. and around the
globe. We are thinking that the US economy will be ugly and outside of a few
of the Asian Tigers, worldwide economic activity will be even uglier. Oil
demand much weaker but geopolitical issues likely to keep oil prices firm.

In US -  we are now thinking as bad as down 3.5% to down 5% for 4Q01 GDP.
Coal just died as a result of this and an MSHA upward revision in production
of some 12 MT! Throwing in the towel on coal prices. East could easily lose
another $5/Ton.

I told Rogers by email we are now thinking that we could finish up next
winter with gas inventory of ~ 1.3 TCF. While we are still refining our
thinking, that is a shocking number. It says that yr-on-yr you would lose
3.5 BCF/D of summer injections next summer. It says that the odds of a
recovery of gas prices in 2002 are now looking quite bleak. It says that
longer dated gas prices could be in under pressure. Up until now, we thought
that drilling sector hit could clean this market up enough to get firm
prices by summer 2002. Now we the odds are looking bad.

Lastly, emissions -- I am scheduled to have a reasonably high level
discussion with Senate Environmental committee. Despite the third priority
(1st - Economy; 2nd - Security; and 3rd- Environmental), we are still
thinking that enough noise will be made that we are going towards a 6 MM Ton
SOX budget by 2007. That is likely bullish unless you discount future values
heavily, which we do.

FYI - Can you help Ron sort through these issues.   With OPPD's cooperation, we can easily overcome these issues and make May 02 in-service for 150 MW of rented diesel generation installed at OPPD distribution substations.

Kevin,

A month ago you asked me to investigate a possible physical solution for the OPPD position.   This was subsequently put on hold as a result of other discussions mid-market was pursuing with OPPD (I believe a buyout for years 1 and 2 of the contract).  Around April 19 (just before my trip to Japan for negotiations with MHI on the 501F purchase) you indicated that discussions with OPPD had stalled and you wanted me to continue investigating a physical option.  Based on our continued review, here are are a couple of items you need to be aware of --

Regulatory approvals are onerous in Nebraska.  Example -- Under an Opinion Letter issued by the Nebraska Attorney General, a private electrical power generator can construct a plant in Nebraska but cannot provide power to a public power's existing customer unless the Nebraska Power Review Board grants an exception (only to the public power's in Nebraska).  It is my understanding that this has never been granted to date (no precedent).  Pre-construction approval will still be required from the Nebraska Power Review Board (even if these parameters are met).  
Currently, we have one site with land rights (owned by NNG).  The other sites would require easements (if we decided to build on 3 sites per discussion in the next bullet).
Emission thresholds (minor source) limits a block of recip engine gen sets on diesel fuel to 12 MW. The limit goes to about 50 MW with this equipment on natural gas (only 50 psig needed). Therefore, if this equipment were used at Omaha, we would need to develop at least three sites to get to 150 MW.
According to those who are investigating these types of solutions suggest that availability of the equipment based on the configuration noted above will be difficult (if not impossible) to acquire by the 2002 timeframe.

I have contacted OPPD and they are willing to assist us in this effort but want to know more details.  I initially intended to address this position with one site but as you can see this will be next to impossible given the above discussion.  Do you want me to continue pursuing this initiative?  

Your input would be appreciated.  Thanks, Ron.

While this explains the 29 open names, when added to the roughly 600 confirmed acceptances, it leaves us roughly 20 short of the approved headcount budget. I will follow up later today with a list of which groups will therefore start next Friday, under their headcount budgets.

Again to confirm, any of the above who do not accept prior to close of business Monday (Houston 5pm) will have their offers either pulled and/or start dates with UBS delayed probably to post February 16th.

The below information gives a brief update of the current situation between Local 15 and Midwest.  We expect to have additional information tomorrow from our sources.  

Sources report the following:
Local 15 is currently in the planning stages of a strike and are hoping that while this process is going on, negotiations will start with Midwest.  
The real issue with Local 15 is when Midwest purchased ComEd, they assumed all ComEd agreements with the labor union.  However, the labor union feels Midwest has not complied with this agreement and at this point Local 15 is using the threat of a strike to get Midwest's attention.  
IBEW sanctioned a strike last Friday and took this action as a sign of support for the Local 15.  The IBEW support gives the Local 15 bargaining power in their discussions with Midwest.  The hope is that the possibility of a strike will put enough pressure on Midwest to get them to the negotiation table.  Chicago's Local 15 union is a compilation of 7 local unions.
Since Midwest took ownership of the plants, there has been 45 cases brought before the grievance committee and all 45 cases have been referred to arbitration. These cases were filed due to the labor unions perception of Midwest not following the original labor contract.  Currently, the labor union lacks the funds for this costly procedure.  Prior to Midwest, ComEd and the labor unions were able to work out grievances.
The IBEW has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming Midwest is unwilling to negotiate.  The hearing is scheduled for July 10th.

Everyone -

Don and I are still using the old EES Company Code of 1596 and Cost Centers 150254 - 150258.  Do we need to change to an EWS/ENA Company #?  

LaDonna, please correct me if this is not correct.

I think we need to change company number to ENA and hopefully just transfer the same cost cemters to this new company #.

Kevin -

I was requested by Prof Webb to participate in an Energy Panel Discussion at UVA and have agreed.  Some of our competitors will be there and this will hopefully further our recruiting efforts.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.

Thanks,

Kevin -

Berney offered this up and I usually wouldn't consider, BUT:  Edith is out through next week and i would really like her to get the benefit of a download from Berne.  What do you think on this one.  Issue is whether we can give Berne his $1300 deposit.  Berney is very ok withg this as his his family.  Everything else being equal I would probably take him up on it.

Also, we are going forward as discussed with Decker and Zurita.

Bottomline:

Current Vacation Plans
Fri July 27th - Sun Aug 5th ( 6 Business days)
Destin, FL.
Issue: $1,300 Non-refundable Deposit

Proposed Vacation Plans
Thurs Aug 9th - Mon Aug 13th ( 3 Business days)
San Antonio, TX
Proposal: Reimbursement for non-refundable deposit

Question: Given the current activity level and momentum we've achieved, is it worth it to Enron to have me here for 3 more business days?

If you can let me know as soon as possible, I can rearrange my plans with no other incremental costs. My family is OK with this change if appropriate.

Thx

Berney

Mr.Thode, 
  I wanted to follow up on the voice mail mesasge I left you this afternoon regarding Power 2001, our senior level power conference taking place in Scottsdale at the end of October.
  Energy trading is one of the key areas of focus for this event. Since the power executives that are attending this conference are the very people you are looking to attract to your exchange, I wanted to bring this event to your attention and see if you were interested in learning more about the promotional opportunities that I have available.
  I have attached a program for the event so that you can see the highly impressive speaker faculty that we have developed. These speakers will be joined by 200-250 of their peers. The fact that each attendee is paying $2,000 to attend, is a clear indication that they are in the market for new ideas and solutions.
 <<At A Glance.doc>> 
  The sponsorship opportunities vary in scope and price depending on the level of visibility you require. I have numerous packages ranging from exhibiting, through the hosting of a lunch, to sponsoring the conference golf tournament. All packages include extensive pre-conference marketing. Moreover, we will work with you on site to ensure that we introduce you to the attendees your sales team is most keen to meet.
   Power 2001 has the backing of Deloitte Consulting, who are sponsoring this conference franchise on a global scale. Deloitte are joined by PA Consulting, Navigant Consulting, Aquila and Squire Saunders & Dempsey as the lead sponsors of the US event. We are also working with such publications as Project Finance International, Megawatt Daily and Platt's Electricity Reports during the marketing of the conference. You can therefore be sure that we are reaching exactly the right people.
  Please get back to me with your thoughts and feedback on the program and let me know if you are interested in learning more about the sponsorship opportunities that I have available.
Kind Regards, 
Tim

   Russell would like for you to meet with him for an informational
   interview. An in person meeting would be preferable,

   but whatever is available with your schedule is fine.  My understanding
   is that he is not formally looking for a job

   yet, but trying to get a feel for different types of positions available
   within the energy industry. Erik is the son of

   one of Russell's clients and will graduate from school in May.  I will
   try to get more color from Russell and forward it

I will fly to Austin ahead of the group for Barton Creek....I will be there ahead to make sure all rooms and activities have been taken care of.  I tried to put my flight on Dana's credit card and it would not work so I asked Julie to just put it on yours.  You will see a flight to Austin for me for $60.00.

As a follow-up to our meeting on Saturday, I talked with the designer of my house (Todd Rice with Rice Residential Design) and the electrical plan is not on a CAD system.   The electrical plan was hand drawn.

If you need a copy of the plan, my preference is that you deal directly with Todd and his staff as I am very busy during the week.

Subject:	Perf Reports - Baseball Stats

Kevin,
Below find your regions performance broken into  "baseball stats".  These numbers where generated off daily pnl's and would include reserves released, etc.

?	Transactional batting average is given the number of days (103), how many times did you show a profit on your daily pnl statement.  Keep in mind two things, a batting average of 300 is considered great in baseball. However, tossing a coin gives a 50/50.  Given that these numbers are daily pnl's and not trading strategies (strategies, you get to pick your pitch), I think the coin toss is the better measure.  With this in mind, anything above 50/50 reflects intellectual capital (research) at work.  If the average is significantly below 50/50, the suggestion would be to improve fundamental analysis.
?	Dollar weighted batting average is the absolute dollars made divided by absolute dollars made and lost.  Differences between transactional batting average and dollar weighted batting average are attributed to trading discipline.
?	Win/loss ratio is total dollars made vs. total dollars lost.  This ratio says that for every dollar bet, how much paid.
?	Trading efficiency reflects the ratio average wins vs. average losses.  A "pos" shows that average wins exceed average loss.  The important note here is that the larger the win/loss ratio, the greater the trading efficiency, i.e. letting profits run while cutting losses early.  "Neg" efficiency implies that the trader holds onto his losses too long.

Does this add any insight into your portfolio?

You have the right Kevin Presto.   I have been employed at Enron now for almost 7 years.   I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US.    Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and Enron's culture in general.

How are you doing?   I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years.   I think the last time I saw you was at Mark Bayless' wedding (85-86?) if my memory is correct.

Where is your job located and what work have you done with Enron?

Hi Kevin,

Apologies if this is the wrong Kevin Presto, but I ran across your name
on the Enron website.  In my previous job, I used to do a lot of work
with Enron on overseas ventures and was surprised to see your name on
the website.  Did you grow up in the Tri-Cities, Washington, and attend
Bethlehem Lutheran School?  If so, I am not sure if you remember me, but

I also went to BLS and was your classmate.

Drop me a line if I have the right person.  Would be interested to
hear about your work at Enron and what you have done in the interim
after leaving Washington state.

I need your approval to authorized an additional pickup of goods at the apartment that Keith has been living in so we can get all the family goods moved to his house.  As a reminder, this move was deferred by Keith as per his request back in the original offer letter. The additional expense would be approximately $500.

I sent an email to Sondra McGrew to let her know that Keith is ready to set up his move.  If the household goods survey has not been done yet, Sondra will contact Keith to set up the survey and assign the van line.  As you know, the household goods shipment is billed direct  to Enron. Kim, if you are approving  shipment of auto(s), please let me know  by return email.

Keith, you should keep your receipts to get reimbursed for the final Enroute expenses incurred by you and your family. That includes, mileage, meals, snacks and hotel. Your benefit packages includes reimbursement for one night of hotel (based on original receipts) for every 350 miles driven. Be sure to keep all receipts. I get the originals (taped on 8 1/2  x 11 paper) and submitted with the completed Moving Expense Statement, signed by you and your manager.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.  I am in EB-1575 through  5/18/01; then the Relocation Center will move to EB-1651. My phone number should stay the same: 713-345-8696.


Let me know if you have additional questions.

Kevin,
 
Put Russell down as 100%.  He's in San Antonio this weekend with his visiting brothers and unfortunately, his contract is here in Houston.  I talked to him last night and he had Jeannie Sloan fax his doc to the hotel and he assured me he'd review it then or first thing this a.m.  I'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 30-day evergreen.  As for additional $'s, I personally guaranteed him $10k and gave him 50-50 odds on the 1-year contract we talked about yesterday.  He's in either way.
 
 I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message, but haven't heard back yet.  I'll lob another call in this morning around 10am.
 
Did you receive a faxed signature copy from Carson yesterday/this a.m.?

Andy,  based  on my interpretation of your memo we are not tracking each other.  I believe we should have the right to sink just as the load control areas do.  This is an absolute must to level the playing field.  They have a huge advantage on any thing going to implementation.  We may need to go back to FERC or even the courts and,in my opinion we should not do any thing to weaken this stance.  If we get something better than ENTERGY take it but do not support it.  Let everyone know that we expect to be treated like any other player including the affiliates, Control Areas, and anyone else in the market place.  This is not the time to support a position that allows for discrimination.  You may want to discuss this in house.  But this is the position I think we should take on most issues as we go into the RTO era.  Sounds unbending but we must get a level playing field.  Now you know why I am not to popular in some meetings and some times with NERC staff.  So be it..

Dick,

I am assuming you are referring to the "at-least-one" proposal?  I think that is a given that the "at-least-one" proposal is gone.

If you are referring to the alternate proposal "no S2S required, evaluate impacts at time of scheduling," that is essentially going to be the best we can get besides "no analysis and use TLR to solve the problems of over scheduling,"  and there is no way we will get that implemented.

I think based on you statement about FIST (they don't need the schedules until they reach implementation) means we are the same page here, but let me know if that is not correct.

Andy, this is some what short of the ENTERGY restrictions but still much to restrictive to allow effective parking.  TheFIST program has shown that they do not need these schedules until they reach implementation.  The utilities within the MISOare not showing Source and Sink .  They are using there own systems to hide there true S$S.  I do not think we should support this solution even if we can not get it changed.  It will undermind other efforts to eliminate the advance requirement for source and sink.

Yesterday, at the Midwest ISO, we successfully managed to quash the MISO's "at least one source-to-sink reservation" proposal.

MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on transmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was too restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point was too relaxed.  Their proposal was that "at least one" reservation on a tag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule would be denied for improper use.

Representatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with me to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the Entergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two conference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually pressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was unacceptable.  

The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:

	1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation specified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.
	2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the transaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will be approved
	3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation did NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will be denied

While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great deal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same time allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without a loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility within MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under the IRCA.  

This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy S/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are necessary.

As an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will allow for "partial" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate proposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is tagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change. 

A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached.  Proposal 4, Discussion item "Confusing POR/POD Naming," Discussion Item "MISO Proposal  ...time of scheduling," and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading.

Thanks - that's what I needed to know.  I'm still not sure if it is a two-w=

Announcing the new Single Market Design Forum
MISO, PJM and SPP announce the formation of a Single Market Design Forum.
The forum is designed for the purpose of identifying the needs of market
participants and promoting effectiveness and efficiency in electricity
markets. The forum hopes to meet the needs of all customers and stakeholders
using the electric power grid. 
The boards of directors, officers and members of MISO, PJM and SPP have a
shared vision and are committed to the development of a single market. Many
market participants, state commissions and FERC have expressed a desire for
this type of common market structure.
The first meeting of the Single Market Design Forum is scheduled for Friday,
February 8, in Washington, D.C., at the FERC Building, 888 First Street,
N.E. A registration form and meeting details are attached to this message.

I don't like the 2nd bullet - not positive enough.   We are the dominant player in the power market.  With respect to volumes for term trades, the risk group will have to provide that to you.   I can tell you that the volumes have increased in the term market by a significant factor (at least 10 times relative to last year).

Kevin - 

Thanks again for taking the time to visit with us a few weeks back regarding your business.  Based upon our discussions, I have included a draft of an East Power Slide.  We are still waiting on final volumes for 3Q01; however, I was curious if you could take a minute to review the conceptual content and let me know if you have any other ideas/comments.  In the last bullet, we would like to articulate the fact that you are creating liquidity in longer term markets.  If I recall correctly, you mentioned your term volumes had increased exponentially compared to the prior year.  Can we get more specific and talk about # MW's transacted and the length of such contracts? (ie, my last bullet is a placeholder).

We are going to meet with Greg on Friday and discuss a draft of the entire presentation.

When you have a minute, please give me a call at X34785.

Kind Regards.

Kevin -

I had the company tickets to the Tuesday, September 11 game against the Giants that was cancelled.  It will be re-played tomorrow evening.  I was going to see if you and Dale Furrow wanted to go (Berney is out of town) and maybe Lavo or Richter.  I think Bonds has 69 homers and very well might hit 70 tomorrow.

Let me know if you would like to join us.

Dear Mr. Fallon,  

We are presently looking for suppliers in the Ohio
market for electricity. Do you have supplies available
and are licensed to operate in Ohio? We are brokers
looking for that type of relationship. Please advise.

I would like to be able to select days, months, years, etc. for historical liquidation.   Somehow, we need to make the cubes or Metastock more user friendly so the traders will actually use them.

I have tried to use the cubes and, although the data is extremely powerful, scrolling through all the years and months is quite cumbersome and drilling down is a pain.

Can we somehow improve the user friendliness of these tools.

Thanks.

Your perception is correct.   Remember 4 years of culture is at work here.   I told Rogers this morning, we have to move to 35, clearly define the process for pricing deals, and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value.

The whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than I originally thought.

Tamara,

A collegue in the Houston office forwarded on a message from Kevin that I should contact you to set up some telephone interviews with the following people;

Kevin Presto (VP - head of East Power Trading)
Fletcher Sturm (VP - head of midwest trading - East Power)
Dana Davis (VP - head of northeast trading - East Power).

Could you let me know a possible schedule? I'm available anytime this week, including any evening (London time) calls.

Many thanks, 

Tim

Good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift - much appreciated.  The family is great - Caitlin just turned 3 and Dane is now 4 months old.

I hope Fran and the kids are doing great - how's your new addition?   We will be going to Miami Sept 13-16 (Miami revenge on Washington) and hopefully we can hook up for a beer.

As far as the guy from Citizens - we really don't know that much about him.   Where is Tony Altman - under a bus somewhere?

I got your voice mail this morning.  I've heard of snail-mail, but that
kind of delay really is impressive!  I thought maybe the package got lost,
or more likely, pilfered by one of your unscrupulous co-workers (just
kidding).

In any case, now you have my e-mail address.

Also, we have a new president of the unregulated trading shop (if you can
call what we do "trading") - Mark Maisto from Citizens.  Seems like a sharp
guy.  Do you know anything about him?

How's Evelyn, Katlin Page and the new one doing (I forgot his name - Kevin
Jr.?).

I would like for you guys to tell me what reports, etc., you will need from the NEW system to effectively manage your risks (what you need to be happy every morning).  We don't have to be all inclusive at this point, but it will help us to begin designing a systems framework to meet your requirements.  Don't hold back - feel free to dream.  Our IT department will tell us what can and can't be done.

There will be a meeting tomorrow (Friday) from 10:30 to noon in room 888 (Janet's old office) to discuss.  Let me know if you can't go.

Also, if I missed anyone who should be there, feel free to invite them.

A few more details on this.  This is a 15MW QF on the FPC system.  They are offering 7x24 energy, 3 yrs. beginning 4/1/02.  The facility is near Tallahassee, but on the FPC system.  He said he would guaranty 80% availability off the unit.  The best bid he has on the table currently is $29.  When I run 80% availability on the model, your MID is $29.18 ($31.98 MID for Firm LD--for comparison).

Any interest in this product?

I agree.   We don't know the base value of the current deal, so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring.

I do not think we should restructure until we have completed ausit and re-booking.  I have expressed this and we have made all efforts to prioritize and work with the deal teams.  This will continue to be my message unless you feel otherwise.

Subject:	Restructure and rebooking meeting

	We currently have several deals that are in the process of being restructured and/or unwound.  The same issue that came up with Quebecor has surfaced on these deals as well; are we giving away value by not having them booked correctly?  All the transactions that Casey and myself are working on consist of these types of deals.  We need to tell origination when they can expect to close these deals.  This will of course depend on how much remodelling needs to be done.  Can everyone meet at 4:00 today to discuss this?  The meeting shouldn't take to long.  Thanks for your time.

I did not realize we were going to reserve on spreads which create zero net position and almost zero credit risk.   The new forward correlations are 90+% per the var model and it looks like your credit model is still using the old correlations.

Kevin,

I thought we agreed to take these reserves since EOL lacks the pricing capability for longer dated transactions.  If you want we can restrict trading to 36 months on EOL and approve long-dated transactions on a one-off basis to insure our counterparty positions remain somewhat balanced.

Please advise,
Bill

You and I had agreed to the structure below for '04 and '05 transactions.  We are not taking credit reserves to the extent the trades are offsetting.  Since '04 is rolling off shortly, we should review the EOL needs for East Power and again come to agreement on the pricing structure.  Let me know when you would like to do so.

Ed

	Peak				$0.10 for '04 & '05	(vs $0.17 for '05)
	Peak Cal Spreads		$0.06
	Peak Basis			$0.04 (assumed correlation of 95%)
	Off Peak			$0.03
	Off Peak (basis or spreads)	$0

There should be no credit on a TVA/Cin spread.   The correlation between the 2 markets is 95% plus.

Guy,

Your intent for the conference calls was right. We need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers. But it must be a coordinated effort. There was no need to cancel the calls. Please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have, please contact  the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions. We appreciate your efforts and like ComEd and AEP, I am sure we will continue to work closely. 

East -  Michael Brown x3-1930

Central - Brad Snyder  x5-8802

West - Pearce Hammond x3-1438


thanks,

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI; 

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Kevin,

Got your voicemail.  I put a call into Jody Pierce regarding (1) the monies which I believe you are owed due to the change in the carry charge (8% vs. 9%) and also the additional depreciation that you should not be required to pay and (2) the balance of the major maintenance account.  In addition, I did speak with Don regarding the increase in the price for the Summer offtake.  I haven't been able to get in touch with Blandford on this but will let him know that the offtake portion of the deal is a bit of a moving target.

Rika,
The Callaway issue is kind of sticky.  Their condensate storage tank was clogged with debris.  They figured they may have other pumps clogged.  That's why they shut down and looked through the systems.  However, back when Cook first had its problems a few years ago, they started with debris clogging pumps.  The NRC is going to want to be sure there isn't any debris causing some backup system to be inoperable.
 
There is going to be a meeting on 2/27/02 at the site at which the Augmented Inspection Team will talk about the results of their inspection.  That should give an indication of restart.  Do you want me to attend?

FYI - I told Tim earlier that I am in for the EES project.  I expect that you guys are speaking regularly but thought I would send a quick note.

I am working out transition of my existing projects with Jake over the next couple of days.  I am back in Houston on Monday and think I will be available to start at that point.

See you next week - Terry

this goes back to my question on the portfolio. We cannot serve these customers from the get go as effectively as the incumbent portfolios so we are going to have to make the decision somewhere that we want the load and that we will need some 'loss-leaders'. I am working on this for our own deals and this will be reflected in our curves.

I have not heard anything more on the deals lost since the last report showing we were pretty competitive. If they have a problem with the curves I would like to hear it directly. I have a meeting with Janet next week and I will go over this issue and the Ader issue then.

We are losing lots of deals in ERCOT on price.  This is part of the reason they are being so aggressive with customers and alternative suppliers.   I have received this feedback directly from Rogers and Janet.

thanks for the info. 

Until we straighten this out internally we will just look ridiculous in front of the customer. Once again, this is an obvious wholesale product. I am happy to compete on price, the question is how much damage does this do externally.

Looks like Ader & Co. at work in ERCOT.   I view this as a big problem.   These customers need to be covered by wholesale.   Both of you should take this as a slap in the face.

Tom,
Will you be available for the following visit?  This is another large group...  In order to keep this from being disruptive, we were thinking of dividing the group into two for two separate overviews.  These overviews should only be 10 minutes in length.  One would be at 11:00 am and the other at 11:15 am.

Let me know if this is a possibility.

Thanks.

Ader has managed to get cross-wise with another good employee.  =20

Ader's "supply group" has essentially stolen Roger's approved ERCOT LSE acc=

has none.   This is BS and should not be tolerated.

Kevin and Rogers,

After meeting with Ader yesterday to discuss some LSE topics and sending hi=
m a polite, to the point email, I received this email response from him.  T=
his email completely misrepresents what was dicussed and makes me look bad =
to management.  I am about ready for war, so I think it is better that some=
one else look at this before I do something to get fired.  I have never bee=
n so completely disgusted with someone who is supposed to be a figure of re=
spect and authority, and is a Vice President at a company like Enron.  My e=
mail was addressed to Ader and Bernstein and copied Rogers and Nancy Hetric=
k since these are the people who have knowledge of the subject matter.  For=
 him to copy the people he did, and hide behind his contacts, while lying a=
bout our conversation, and skewing it in a manner in which I would never ac=
t, is inexcusable.  I would expect more from a 4th grader.  Sorry for the r=

Joe,

I requested a meeting with you yesterday to work with you and convey what w=
e have learned over the last three months by working with regulatory and th=
e ERCOT ISO to utilize and create additional LSE accounts.  As you were inf=
ormed by Nancy Hetrick of regulatory all three currently available LSE acco=
unt are committed by Structured Supply for use under currently negotiated m=
asters.  We requested the meeting with you yesterday to explain what we wer=
e doing and why we needed the other three EES LSE accounts.  We also took t=
he time to explain the process for establishing new LSE accounts, under a L=
LC structure which is not complicated, but the structure that the new LSE a=
ccounts would be created under (SPV) is inconsistent with the masters negot=
iated and EES would not be able to perform under these masters.

We have tried to work with you in cooperation to accomplish your goals cons=
istent with the constraints of the ERCOT rules.  We have explained our need=
s and the reason for them. We conveyed our interest in working together to =
accomplish the greater good for the company and offered our help in any way=
 we could.  You mark and I agreed that it would be easier to help each othe=
r and not duplicate efforts.  We were appreciative of your willingness to p=
roceed consistent with this spirit of cooperation.  It disheartens and surp=
rises me that you would leave the meeting with this understanding and in ag=
reement of the business situation and send an e-mail the next morning, with=
out picking up the phone or stopping by to discuss this and just attempt to=
 dictatorially commandeer the LSE accounts that you knew were committed and=
 why they were committed. =20

Moreover; you told us that you thought you might need one more and you have=
 attempted to take three more.

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the LSE situation in ERCOT.  The p=

He inquired if Enron could provide transmission hedges for the Neptune project.

Any interest. Please, feel free to contact Ed directly and let me know.

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Ed

Subject:=09FW: Upgraded web site



We have upgraded the web site and it the newer version now is on a new serv=
er.  The transition should be very smooth as it is identical on face value =
to the existing site.  Please note the new link and replace your current fa=
vorites entry with this one.

http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/

We will run both sites in parallel for the next week.  Barring any major co=
mplications the current site will go down next Friday  Sept. 21 afternoon.

I understand that the process might not have been completely fair.  I think it may have bene a "guilt by association" deal or a "kill the messenger" deal.  I am digging into it to determine all of the facts.   It poses some potential legal issues if we try/need to keep him but I think I can work around it if it warrants.  The kid seems strong to me and I need to keep some semblance of order in the URM reporting group.

Kim -

Neil has decided to leave the company.  Neil says he is just burned-out and needs to help his parents for awhile and give some thought to his career.  Neil has agreed to help us through the 21st if we desire.  Can you help me work through the appropriate exit process for Neil.

Also, Brian Butler has decided to leave to take a position with Reliant.  Brian has been doing our day-to-day URM reporting for the past several months.  Brian was ranked a five and feels as though he/the group's obstacles have been underestimated.  Honestly, I have not heard anything but positives on this person and do not think we should let him just walk out.  I duscussed with him and he would very much like to stay with Enron, especially given some of the proposed personnel/structural changes we are undertaking.  Could you provide a summary of employee history on Brian so we can make a quick call - he is due to leave next week.

Thanks,
Rogers

T Jae, it was decided today that legal will move over here this weekend.  Can you please arrange for Kevin's things to be boxed up so legal can move in downstairs over the weekend.

Ina, if there are any of John Arnold's personal effects left on 5 can you please have them boxed up? 

If we can hold off until next week to set the new offices up I'm sure that Darren and David would be very grateful!

Any interest if offering an odd block of 30MW, into SOCO, 5x16, Cal'02.  Duke Energy is asking?  I told him it would be at a premium to our EOL offer for the odd block, if we would sell it at all.

Kevin - As you may know, Saji is now over at EBS but due to the general uncertainty is looking around for opportunities.  I have spoken with him and think he will be interested in coming over to help but when he relocated last year he committed (contractually) to stay with the group for a year - He is waiting a few of days to make a decision because he anticipates a redeployment.  I told him we could use his help immediately and am trying to get him to make a decision.

I wanted to warn you that he may be calling - I am interested in having him if we can get him away from EBS.  Thanks!

Jim,
 
Thanks for the help.
 
As I mentioned, AWS (originally Automated Weather Source) has more than 5500 weather stations deployed around the US.  This is the most dense real-time weather network in the country.  We gather data from all of these stations through the Internet, and can feed it out as live data streams.  We also have an 8-year historical repository of the data that was gathered as the network was built out.  As an example, in the Houstonarea we have 82 weather stations.  The National Weather Service has 6.  Each of our stations measures windspeed and direction, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, light, and barometric pressure and 400 of our stations have digital cameras.  We can analyze 27 different weather parameters in real-time.  Check out www.aws.com
 
Our current products are consumer-oriented.  We sell our services to TV broadcast stations, i.e. KPRC in Houston.  We also wrap the data in advertising and offer it as the WeatherBug.  AWS' WeatherBugproduct is now the largest weather destination in the USas measured by Media Metrics.
 
We are now exploring how our data might be applied to the Energy industry.  Examples include offering real-time weather data to energy trading operations which shows in  real-time the deviation from forecast.  This can be at the national, regional, metropolitan or local levels.  You could watch a weather front move into a metropolitan area and see how it is shaping up as compared to the forecast to aid in energy purchases, bids, etc.  The data could be used with basis risk in derivative contracts.  It could also be used to forecast what a specific NWS station was going to forecast in the near future.  You may have more uses.  Most of our sites are located in and around metropolitan areas which is a positive for energy demand.  
 
We would like to talk with the folks running Enron's trading area to discuss if this data could be used and what products might be built for the industry.
 
Thanks and regards,

An update -- CONFIDENTIAL please.
 
The majority of people have voted for a financial congestion management model, which is what Enron wants.  It is based on the SPP cornerstones, which are LMP in real time, unbalanced schedules, and a variety of financial instruments to hedge the forward transmission market, including options/obligations/FTRs/ financial flowgate (bundled FTRs).
 
We are in the process of trying to bring some others to this.  To facilitate this, the judge agreed with my idea that Enron (Mike Roan) and Entergy (Rick Riley who has worked with Ron Mc on the SPP model) would make these two "experts" available to visit with those that have further questions.
 
In that regard, Tim Woodbury of Seminole and Bob Williams of FMPA would like to have a visit.  Tim is very close to agreeing that he likes the financial model (thanks to the good work in setting the basis of Dan Staines.)  Please let Mike Roan know if you would like to attend.

I know you are quite busy but I wonder if you could get your lead trader to look the following forecast for NEEPOOL. This may result in you getting the lead for a large block of the power so be conservative but have enough in there so it is a win win if you know what I mean.
 
Have him fill in what he can. The client will be looking long 10 year, with maybe a series of 2 and 5 year deals. Should be putting out around 500 to 700 Mwe.
 
Do not disclose the plant eh ?

The NRB ruling has not come down yet BUT the Union President has received a phone call from the National Labor Relations Board (NRB) and they will be ruling in favor of the Union, forcing Midwest to the negotiation table.
Midwest has been notified of this and are attempting to call for a special meeting with the NRB to be released from the negotiations.
At that time, the NRB is prepared to have a judge require that Midwest to come to the table.
If Midwest comes to the table but is not willing to negotiate, Labor 15 will proceed with a strike.  At this time, it is estimated the strike will take a week to implement after a strike decision is made.  This is due to the newly formed Labor 15 and its disorganization.

As I said in a previous email , Joe Murphy, CEO of Refco Global Futures and Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC will be here Thursday afternoon through dinner to further our discussions for providing a hosted marketplace where Enron would stream products with wider bid/offer and smaller volume to their "retail" customer base.  

The purpose of their visit is to firm up our discussion so that we can start drafting a term sheet for the deal. 

I have carved out 1 hour this Thursday Oct 4 from 4:30 to 5:30pm in EB 27C2 to discuss the products that we currently make markets in and the volumes Refco currently handles for their customers.

Would you or someone in your group be interested in attending?  Several of the guys from the Oil & Refined products group will be there and I am waiting to hear if John Arnold or a representative of his will attend.  Let me know.

Regards

I didn't work with Ravi directly, however I believe he is extremely well qualified based on his experience. He would likely be a good asset for the group however I do not know exactly in what role (perhaps mid marketing or orig. or as a quant/trader).  What I am not sure of is if he wants to trade.  I will talk to him today and will get back to you.

Rika,
For months we had no meetings, now all of a sudden I'm bringing one up
almost every week.

This meeting Fred said would be very beneficial to attend.  It occurs Nov
1&2, 2001.  It concerns nuclear industry consolidation and deregulation
issues.  It is covering a full range of important issues in our forecasting
analysis including licensing, inspection, enforcement & assessment,
decommissioning, deregulation, etc.

Again, I brought this up to Fred to see if he agreed on the import of this
meeting, and he strongly suggested we attend.

Let me know as soon as possible because it is scheduled for this week.

Thanks,
Dan

Williams Signs $10 Million Weather and Climate Research Alliance with the University of Oklahoma
August 27, 2001 09:02:00 AM ET
Increased Accuracy of Weather Prediction Technology 
Provides Significant Economic Advantages for Energy Industry Leader 
TULSA, Okla., Aug. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- A unit of Williams WMB </inc/news/quoteredir.asp?symbol=us:WMB> today announced a $10 million strategic alliance with the University of Oklahoma (OU) to enhance weather and climate research, technology development, and undergraduate and graduate meteorology education. 
This commercial arrangement, the largest of its kind in the U.S. between a private corporation and a university meteorology program, is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows OU to expand its top-tier meteorology programs while Williams receives exclusive weather analysis and forecasting tools. This will give Williams a globally competitive advantage in energy marketing and trading, while related educational and research activities are expected to produce for Williams the nation's most qualified meteorologists and weather impact decision makers. 
"This is a partnership between business and higher education where both parties benefit," Keith E. Bailey, Williams chairman, president and CEO, said. "This alliance provides Williams access to weather research and technology that is dramatically superior than traditional government weather services and customized to Williams' unique needs. With weather being the number one driver of volatility in gas and power markets, we expect to see a significant return on our investment." 
"This history making agreement between Williams and the University of Oklahoma's School of Meteorology, a national leader in its field, is a dramatic demonstration of the power of a private sector-university partnership in the creation of economic productivity and growth, and the expansion of knowledge," said OU President David L. Boren. "I predict that this alliance will become a national model for joining together American international leadership in higher education with private sector creativity and vitality. We are deeply grateful for the confidence placed in this outstanding program at the University by Williams." 
Highlights of this expansive agreement include: 
    * Unique, advanced weather and climate prediction capabilities tailored by
      the University of Oklahoma's Weather Programs specifically for Williams'
      weather-sensitive businesses.
    * A grant of $8.1 million over five years to fund research in advanced
      weather analysis and prediction at the Center for Analysis and
      Prediction of Storms (CAPS).  This includes funding for a supercomputer
      that will be most powerful among all Big-12 institutions.
    * A grant of $1.6 million over five years to fund regional climate
      research at the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological
      Studies.  This money will bring to OU the most advanced climate system
      model in the world, and will fund research scientists as well as
      graduate and undergraduate students.
    * Gifts to create the Williams Endowed Chair, an advanced student computer
      laboratory, funding for three Williams Fellows in the Master of Science
      in Professional Meteorology Degree in the School of Meteorology and a
      gift to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey.
"We believe the outcome of this partnership will yield a world class suite of weather forecast and analysis products suited for use in the energy marketing and trading industry," says Denise Russell, director of Market Analysis at Williams' energy marketing and trading unit, who, in 1998 began to hire OU meteorology graduates. "We also will have a valuable pipeline for new technological and human resource capabilities with which to maintain these developments." 
According to Dr. John Snow, dean of the OU College of Geosciences and director of Oklahoma Weather Center programs, the School of Meteorology, has already begun to aggressively recruit some of the nation's top graduate students as part of the new partnership, and will expand this effort in the next several months now that the contracts are signed. 
"Through this alliance with Williams, The University of Oklahoma has obtained the resources necessary to continue generating new knowledge, defining the global standard for weather technology and developing outstanding graduates, all while bringing new jobs and opportunities to Oklahoma in weather-related fields," says Snow. 
The Williams/OU alliance was made possible through technology advances in computing resources and the enactment of Oklahoma State Questions 680 and 681, which provide for the establishment of commercial entities that are licensed for the exclusive right to commercialize the technology developed within research and development sections of universities.

Therefore, I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with.   Obviously, this includes Dale.   With respect to the rest of the EES group, I am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for Enron's shareholders.

Will he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly.   This essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept.   Can we at least get a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period?

An offer from any Scherer unit(s) would work.  He understands the odd lot will demand a premium, but I can't talk him into a round 50MW.  So, 2 pieces of energy: 
	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16

Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?   Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

TEA is looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, June-Sep'02, into MEAG.  Also looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, Cal'02, into MEAG.  I told them we may be more willing to offer into GTC.  His response was he would need to know which facility or interface would be the source (I suspect this is so he can reserve ahead to use his network transmission).  

Any interest?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that for Power, basis curves and region curves have the same risk type "P".  I draw my question from the gas market, a Dec 01 fixed price New York deal, gets decomposed into a price, basis and index leg.  Each risk type gets simulated (except index) for VAR.  For example, VAR for NY Dec 01 P risk type would be zero, whereas VAR for NY Dec 01 risk type D and Dec 01 NG future (risk type P) would get a VAR.

However, regarding power, it is my understanding that a Dec 01 fixed price deal in NEPOOL isn't decomposed into its respective legs, rather it goes into the system as a Dec 01 NEPOOL deal.  Am I correct, or would a fixed price Dec NEPOOL deal be broken into an R curve piece and a basis curve piece?  Does Enpower do this or is this something done on the deal entry.  Would decomposing it like gas mess up the port calc function in Enpower?

Your feedback would be helpful.

We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.

I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.

Thanks.

Kevin 

As I mentioned to you, due to some recent success in obtaining additional security, we are extending credit to Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only.  We will not be granting them execution rights on EOL due to the lack of controls/functionality for daily transactions.  EOL, unlike ICE, has tenor function set by months versus number of days.  As a result, in the case of Edison Mission, if we set EOL for one month, Edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month.  It seems to make this work for Edison and perhaps other potential counterparties, it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions.  If you would like to discuss further, please call.

For Immediate Release
REGIONAL TRANSMISSION 
EXPANSION  PLAN APPROVED
Plan addresses region's
long-term transmission needs

(Valley Forge, PA - June 7, 2001) - PJM Interconnection, LLC's Board of Managers
approved on Tuesday, June 5 the second Regional Transmission Expansion Plan
(RTEP) for the PJM region. The plan includes more than $420 million of
transmission facility additions and reinforcements to ensure the continued
reliable delivery of electricity in the region and to enhance the robustness of
the PJM energy and capacity markets.
PJM operates one of the largest electricity grids in the nation - a region that
includes all or parts of PA, NJ, DE, MD, VA and D.C. The PJM RTEP, the only such
process of its kind in the nation, consolidates the region's transmission needs
into a uniform, comprehensive strategy. 
The RTEP is unique as it is:
*		 Driven by the comprehensive transmission service needs of the region,
*		 Developed based on input from an inclusive group of stakeholders -
including transmission owners, generation developers, market participants and
representatives from state regulatory bodies,
*		 Recommended by the PJM staff, following extensive evaluation performed
in coordination with PJM transmission owners, to ensure the plan meets the needs
of the PJM transmission system in the most efficient and effective manner, 
*		 Reviewed by all stakeholders in the region through the PJM Transmission
Expansion Advisory Committee, and
*		 Reviewed and approved by the PJM Board of Managers for implementation.
"The RTEP delivers real results through transmission enhancements and expansions
in order to meet the generation and growth needs of the mid-Atlantic region for
the next 10 years," said Phillip Harris, PJM chief executive officer and
president. "In short, this plan ensures bulk power reliability for our region."
PJM's Board of Managers approved the first RTEP in August 2000. As a result of
that plan, approximately $300 million of transmission facility additions and
reinforcements are currently in design or construction to, in part, accommodate
the interconnection of more than 15,000 megawatts of new generating capacity to
the PJM region. This second, updated plan includes transmission upgrades to
ensure the continuing compliance of the PJM system with regional reliability
criteria and to accommodate the interconnection of 43 generation projects,
amounting to more than 12,500 megawatts of new generating capacity. The two
phases of the plan, approved to date, now include more than $720 million of
transmission infrastructure investments and accommodate more than 27,500
megawatts of new generating capacity within the PJM region.
The PJM Board of Managers, an independent, eight-member board that has no
financial interest in any PJM member, oversees the direction of the PJM office
and is responsible for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the robust
and competitive PJM wholesale power market.
PJM operates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and
one of North America's largest power grids. The company currently coordinates a
pooled generating capacity of more than 58,000 megawatts and operates a
wholesale electricity market with more than 200 market buyers, sellers and
traders of electricity. PJM has administered more than $5 billion in energy and
energy service trades since the regional markets opened in 1997. More than 70
nations have sent delegates to PJM to learn about the market model and the
operation of the grid in the mid-Atlantic states.

Kevin,
 
Thanks for the access.  Although, I am also needing access for two analysts in the group - Todd Litton and Erin Willis.
 
You had given access to Jaime Gualy, an associate, but he rotated out of the group in mid-June.  If you agree with the two analysts listed above, the following individuals in the Equity Group would have access to the curves:
 
Michelle Ruch (already has access)

I'm told that the deadline is today.  They need an original signature.  Could you sign off on the Palo Verde hedge exemption for me?  One of the attorneys (I can't remember her name) will bring it to you.

Subject: meetings


Rika,
Here are a couple of meetings that might be interesting:

MEETING 1.  10/24/01 - A meeting to discuss Davis-Besse's (ECAR) proposal to
defer required reactor vessel head penetration inspections to their April
2002 refueling outage.  This is interesting because due to the recent
discoveries of cracked and leaking vessel head penetrations (like that at
Oconee 3), all PWRs are required by Bulletin 2001-01 to perform inspections
and provide information related to the structural integrity of the upper
reactor pressure vessel head penetration nozzles to ensure the integrity of
the reactor coolant system pressure boundary and to demonstrate compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements.  Davis-Besse, however, wants to
defer this inspection/assurance information until their refueling outage in
the Spring of 2002.  The NRC has 4 categories of plants according to risk
for penetration cracking.  They are:
1. Plants that already experienced cracks (Oconee 1, 2, 3; ANO 1; Cook 2)
2. Plants that are considered with high susceptibility (Davis-Besse, and six
other plants)
3. Plants that are considered with moderate susceptibility (32 plants)
4. Plants that are considered with low susceptibility
So, with Davis-Besse in the high susceptible category, the NRC may require
them to provide assurance requiring an inspection and therefore an outage.

MEETING 2.  10/25/01 - The day after the above meeting is a meeting
concerning the Pebble Bed reactor.  This is the reactor type that Exelon is
pushing for construction and use in the US.  Exelon will be discussing with
the NRC the biggest possible "showstopper" for the design--the graphite
coolant.  Graphite can burn (e.g. Chernobyl).  However, pebble bed
proponents say it is unlikely.  The NRC should provide info on their
concerns and leanings which would steer Exelon one way or another.

So far this contract year, we have attended two meetings.  That leaves us
currently with a backlog of four meetings through this month and a rate of
use of .67 meetings per month which would make the projected use for the
year of about eight of the 24 meetings allowed in the contract.  If we
attend the above two meetings, the backlog would be down to two; the rate
would be 1.33 per month; and the projected yearend total would still be only
about 16.

Let me know as soon as possible since meeting #1 is scheduled for tomorrow
so I would need to make plans.
Thanks,
Dan

Tom.....per our discussion a few weeks ago.  I was wondering if you would be interested in going to NY with me to "educate" a few people on the NY power trading market?  The person who needs the most educating is Gavin Donohue, Executive Director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, who is out there talking with the press and regulators about the RTO and the NY marketplace.  He comes from the DEC and knows about environmental issues and generator issues but has a lot to learn about marketers/traders.  Enron is a member of IPPNY and Gavin is new to the organization.  Both Mirant and I agree that we need to be spending more time with Gavin educating him.  What do you think?  Can we schedule something in the near future??

As we re-asses the fundamental information needed by the traders, I think t=

that has extensive and significant working familiarity with the Ercot power=

edge extends beyond the process of the flow of electricity and the transmis=
sion of power to include the ability to program in C++ and VBA.  In regards=
 to Powerworld, he has both academic and practical expertise as well as a t=
echnical understanding of the functionality of the program. He has been lea=

A few more details on this.  This is a 15MW QF on the FPC system.  They are offering 7x24 energy, 3 yrs. beginning 4/1/02.  The facility is near Tallahassee, but on the FPC system.  He said he would guaranty 80% availability off the unit.  The best bid he has on the table currently is $29.  When I run 80% availability on the model, your MID is $29.18 ($31.98 MID for Firm LD--for comparison).

As you may already know, PJM created a spin-off company known as PJM Technologies.  Their goal has been to create packaged, turn-key solutions for the creation of ISOs/RTOs.  

Kevin has expressed an interest in acquiring some of their tools to use in our own analyses of LMP markets.  I have been working with Fran Barrett and Stan Kijewski of PJM Technologies to set up a meeting regarding this potential project.  T. Jae has scheduled a meeting for October 3rd here in Houston for PJM Tech to visit and explain the various tools available and help us determine how they might be used to our advantage.

Unfortunately, I have a speaking engagement on the 3rd, and will not be able to attend.  Therefore, I am attaching the brief overview paper below to provide a bit more background for you all.  There is also a more detailed presentation available at www.pjmtech.com.  It requires you have the most current version of Flash in order to work correctly.

If you have any questions, please let me know and I will try to answer them.

Kevin-

Some of this back end activity may be the buyers of the Calpine retail supply.  Calpine probably sold their length earlier this week or last as they closed these deals and the new buyers (Shell, Reliant, etc) may just be stepping in for some.

I know you are quite busy but I wonder if you could get your lead trader to look the following forecast for NEEPOOL. This may result in you getting the lead for a large block of the power so be conservative but have enough in there so it is a win win if you know what I mean.
 
Have him fill in what he can. The client will be looking long 10 year, with maybe a series of 2 and 5 year deals. Should be putting out around 500 to 700 Mwe.
 
Do not disclose the plant eh ?

In the interim, Fletch and I will assume responsibility.   Obviously, we will be trying to identify a replacement over the next couple of months.

We will be doing some position re-alignment today - transferring some of Rogers positions to Fletch and/or myself at tonight's mids.   I will then re-sell/re-buy some positions back to Rogers which cancel out opposite positions in the retail book.

I will give you the specifics before we mark.

A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.

We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.

Are you guys in?   We will have a blast.

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

Subject:	FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower


To all,

The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.  

Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.

Quick statistics for ONE site:

Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book.
Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).
Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.
Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.
All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.

Recommendations:

Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc.
In the interim:

Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.
Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book).
Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application.
Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).
Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. 	


Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:

Week 1 (May 14-18)

Read Contract.
Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc.
Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions.
Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.

Week 2 (May 21-25)

Continue working on Full Requirements model.
Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.	
Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.
Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.
At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.

Week 3 (May 29-June 1)

Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month.
Again, we ran into problems with the test database.
Completed booking in Enpower.

Week 4 (June 4-5)

Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.
Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

Obviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.   My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.   No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.

I will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow.

Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  

For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:

1. New Gen
2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
4. Coal- utility stockpiles

Thanks,

Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.  

Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).

Thanks.

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Rika,
Just a verification on the December 3-4, 2001 conference meeting in New
York.  I am bringing it up again now because the early registration discount
($200) expires this week.
As a reminder, the meeting includes discussions on major nuclear,
generation, and transmission topics by all the key officials (Meserve-NRC,
Wood-FERC, Blake-DOE, Bingaman-Senate, Connaughton-White House,
Bayless-Dynegy, Peterson-NRG Energy, Rogers-Cinergy).
Conference cost - $1395 (We pay time and expenses).
Again, I'm bringing this up only because of the discount expiration coming
up.  After this, I won't bother you with it again.
It seems a valuable opportunity to understand the direction from all
governmental regulators plus major industry viewpoints.
If we do this meeting, the count for all completed and scheduled meetings
through December will be six out of the contract allowable ten.  That gives
a backlog of four meetings; a rate of 1.2 meetings per month; and a
projected contract year completion of 14.5 meetings out of an allowable 24.
Let me know.
Dan

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

You've got that right.   I'm am short all of the power and am getting frustrated.   I am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power.   There seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels.

In particular, the NE markets refuse to go down despite the fact that Benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 02 and 03 period.   For the 1st time in a couple of weeks, however, the cash market is showing signs of weakness.

Overall, I am very bearish and my position reflects that.   Like you, I have worn some curveshift the past month.

Is this true? And how large are premiums?

Thanks,

Market sees Enron paying a premium with bids
Enron is being forced to pay a slight
premium for forward contracts in the power
market in what may be a reflection of concerns
about its creditworthiness, according
to a number of traders. The higher price the
giant marketer is bidding on its EnronOn-line
platform is either a credit premium,
traders said, or the result of Enron being
short and needing to bid higher than other
players to cover its forward positions.
There were other signs yesterday that
worries continue about Enron's financial
condition. Traders said while most shops
are still trading with Enron, many are continuing
to closely monitor their positions
with Enron and limit their exposure by
balancing out their positions and limiting
transactions to purchases only.
Traders echoed what market sources
have been describing as a reluctance to
risk contributing to Enron's problems.
"It's 'business as usual' with Enron," one
said, "and even if it weren't, I couldn't
tell you. I can't say nothin' on this one."

To be clear, we agreed that if the contract language was modified, it would be loose enough to support a mark this time but should not be used as the model.  We did not agree, though, that this in any way limited our risk from a business perspective.  I'm no trader, but my understanding is we have effectively sold the customer a call that we have to somehow hedge against?  Again, we can mark and support what business decision is made, I just did not want there to be any impression that accounting had opined on the business valuation post year 1.

Guys -

I am not comfortable leaving the appropriations risk "grey", as it has been referred to.  The risk is there and it is real.  If the EES Executive Comittee is comfortable with this strategy/approach then I would expect to have something in writing between EES and EWS releasing EWS of any and all $$ reponsibility associated with this potential, yet unmentioned, risk.

FYI, last time we priced this risk we came up with a notional value of $5MM.

I am on board with providing aggressive pricing and trying to enter new markets.  However, we need to recognize all the risks.

Rogers

750k is BS.   Ron has only been working on this for 3-4 weeks.   He has made one trip to Nebraska.   I expect more like 50-100k in costs incurred.   This is precisely why I told Ron to work directly with Terri on this project.

With respect to Ameren, Ron should work directly with me and Lloyd Will.

We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.   Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.

I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.

In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).   This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.   We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.

Everyone -

Jay has prepared his organizational changes as they relate to East Tariffs.  He mentioned that he is allowing fopr ScottStoness to focus on the West with Steve Swain.

Should we go ahead and make a formal break between East (Jay reporting to me) and West (Swain reporting to Don) so that everyone is clear?  I think we could roll all of this out at once.

Subject:	Load Forecasting Technology



To whom it may concern:

My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State
University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.
Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power
traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.

I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron
millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose
success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I
believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am
way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go
somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.

Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be
promising to read the remainder of this email.

	1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.
	2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning
techniques.
	2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the
Chicago area for ComEd.
	3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of
this.
	4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.
	5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy
Associates in Atlanta.
	6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS
future v5.0
	7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training
engine (not yet released)
	8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced
inductive learning methods.

This is the situation:

	I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced
forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural
network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at
ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The
models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using
the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those
that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have
been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary
studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything
that is available at any price.

	Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have
awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that
I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the
Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).
This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke
even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they
work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors
appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.

John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he
tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd,
Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project
manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software
for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.

Ok.  Here are the possibilities.

	1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading
forecasting technology
	2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about
	3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock
all by himself
	4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as
well send him a data set to test his claims.


I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I
don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my
technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense
asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of
your in-house modeling efforts.

Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am
making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and
ability to sell you their gem.

What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can
do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not
disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and
companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will
show you flaws in other "gems".

I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a
fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have
a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what
opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in
convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will
go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the
leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or
form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.

Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic
for sending you this lengthy email.

So the scoop is He is Average.

He recently moved out of Bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into Continental Power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks.  Is it a problem with the business or him?

He worked for Marcello Romano (Head of Bandwidth Trading in Europe) as John knows.  Marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge.  If Marcello were to run UK Gas again he wouldn't take him - as he is not sharp.  So he wouldn't bother to move him across the Atlantic if it costs a lot.

Your call.  Ring Marcello for more information.

The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.   I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.

Therefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.

Thanks.

Subject: Enron v. FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source and
sink)


The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts?

Subject: Costs associated with the Enron v. FERC matter


Christi -

Dan has informed me that Enron's share of remaining costs in the Enron v. FERC matter will not exceed $4,000, for the work done to prepare for oral argument scheduled for November 7, 2001.

If you need a more formal document indicating this, I would be happy to send one to you.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

What are the biggest needs in fundies right now?

I would like a fundies rotation, risk books,  and real-time.   Risk books or fundies should be the 1st rotation and real-time should be the last.

Kevin -

Lloyd and I spoke yesterday about the idea of outsourcing all of EES' next =
30-day physical obligations in ERCOT to the Wholesale Services Desk (Servic=
es Desk).   Essentially, we would provide Services Desk with a list of cust=
omers, meters, forecasts, and a net open position (load obligation - hedges=
).  Services Desk would fill any net open positions at some hourly index + =
service fee.  EWS-Retail would still hedge all forward risks.  How we handl=
e load forecasting as it relates to changes in our position needs to be iro=
ned out as far as whose forecasts we use - do we consolidate this function?=
 .  My view is that 1) Wholesale Services Desk could benefit by getting an =
opportunity to serve retail load and learn in a low risk position and 2) Se=
rvices Desk will ultimately perform a better service than I could begin to =
recreate.  I want this to be the model that I can build a case on to outsou=
rce all of our next 30 day physical delivery portfolio across the Eastern G=
rid.  Also, Lloyd will be able to best determine what metering capabilities=
 we really need to most accurately deliver and work these requirements thro=
ough the Ozzie/PMC model we have been working on.  Doug is also interested =
and on board with this concept.

 Kevin, you and I can negotiate an overall macro service fee for this stuff=
 once we get it ironed out.

What do you think?

The highlights I would focus on are:

1) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 (compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000)
2) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD (compared to 100 in 2000).   In the last two weeks, EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500.
3) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market.
4) Positive P&L in every Eastern region
5) Outstanding return on VAR.

Hi Tjae-

Jeff Skilling has requested some bullet points about Power Trading before the Floor Meeting. He likes to tailor his discussion to the groups and needs some highlights about your activities. If you or Kevin could send me bullets about the last few weeks or one month's worth of information, that should be enough.

As I told John this morning, we have similar issues with Var in the East.   The correlations between gas & power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month.

I have requested changes to the Var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon.

I am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week.   It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract, so that is my challenge for the hourly group.   Having said that, I concur with your suggestions.

I am assuming you are presenting Narsima and Edith there promotion and contract packages.   Please confirm.

Subject:	SE Hourly

Kevin -

I spoke to Ed Baughman aearlier while on 31 and I wanted to follow-up with a comment on the SE Hourly group. 

I think those guys have done a pretty good job in the first half and have really made the effort to get to know their customers.  I thinkk Juan received a promotion and I hope he is going to get a decent bump in base with that.  However, I am not sure what the status is with Rudy and Miguel.  I think (not sure) that they are under contract and are probably paid a little light vs. the competition.  I would view the going rate for good hourly guys as about $85k based on what I have heard lately.  May stagnate a little bit with the outlook.

Do you think it is worth throwing these two guys a small incentive mid-year to let them know that we are aware of the competition and appreciate the work they are doing.  I am suggesting something small, around $5k each.  What do you think.  I know it is probably not a good day to discuss this but i think it is worth some consideration, and for all I know you have already addressed it.

Also, I would like to postpone our Monday meeting.  I have to interview someone and would like to get with Jay and Mark Jackson and then discuss RSO and T&D positions.

Kevin this summit is right after the hourly Las Vegas trip and I would like to attend.  There is no costs associated with this summit, ESCA is covering the accommodations and I will all ready be in Las Vegas.

Did you want to attend?  

I was told by ESCA that some of our regulatory folks attended last year.

I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.

thanks.

I think it is appropriate to instruct Risk to put the charges associated with the PJM scalar in the Change Deal Bucket as this was out of the Retail Commodity Group's control.  I am trying to hold these guys accountable for positions, p/l and such and I think this is the only way to fairly account for results that they could affect vs. someone else's error/mismark.  Let me know if you think this is appropriate.

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.   Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.

I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.

In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).   This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.   We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.

Filing looks good.  My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.
 
If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.
 
Other thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.    I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.    In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center.

The time is right in the middle of trading on an AGA day.   Therefore, it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend.   I would suggest having Tom May and/or Lloyd attend.

PowerEx will be coming to Houston and would like to meet us on Nov. 7 9:00-11:00.

They are the marketing and trading sub of BC Hydro and have dealt before with our Calgary and Portland offices. They are now opening an office in Toronto and wish to transact more in MAPP, NEPOOL, PJM and SPP. The purpose of their visit is an informal meet n' greet to establish contact with people at Enron.

They will be coming with their Head of Origination and Head of Trading.

Please let me know if you or someone from your group would like to attend.

Thanks,

Dave

Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s).   I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything.  We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.

Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.   We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.

Am I making sense?   In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).   We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.

With respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage.

We are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy.   Most regions have markets on-line through 2003 (TVA, Ent, Cinergy, Com-ed).   In NY, there is zero liqidity for off-peak.   PJM West has pretty decent liquidity through 03.

I hope this helps.

If I could see some off-peak markets I would be buying.  Unfortunately, I know info like this will just be used against me and the positions I am fighting.  Looks like we should be on the bid for some of these coal terminals from the producers.

I have spent more time down that black hole called coal and have gotten even
more bullish than I was when we spoke last. I wanted to give you some
initial reactions, and hope that you will call to discuss your reaactions to
my reactions (if that make sense to you).

In looking at the MSHA data under a finer and finer slice, I was somewhat
surprised to see the purging of employees in NAPP and CAPP. I have also been
making the rounds in the major NAPP and CAPP basins to gauge the level of
new activity, but it is surprising how sluggish the rebound is and will be.
One could write that off to new problems with permitting (intermittent
streams has become a real problem I am told) and/or to hiring problems while
fighting off the coal unions some more. The other theory is that this
oligopology that has gotten its sea legs! I am leaning towards a theory that
the latter will use the former for cover. Given how bad EIA is, that cover
could last a while. This market is ripe for a squeezing IF gas tightens a
bit and net exports is somewhat inelastic at these levels!

Further, it appears clear that aside from being horrible at managing data
and the needs of the public, EIA is incompetent at analysis. I do not think
we built inventory during 1Q01; it was mostly stocks (producer/distributor)
moving to market. I now understand why you were focusing upon my gas
substitution comments. The other area of opportunity is EXIM. No doubt you
have continued to see the drift in international freight and coal prices.
How low can it go (EXIM) - we are in unchartered territory! I know Hill &
Associates think that the US can become an importer over the longer pull.
The problem is the offloading at terminals (what you load, you can't
necessarily offload) and whose terminals they are. Look at the ownership of
the major terminals and you find coal producers.

I have told our gas guys that I am growing more confident that gas will gain
ground from coal this time around for the structural reaons I gave you plus
the fundamental reasons as well. If today's AGA is bullish again, this could
be the makings of an interesting market op.

Subject:	Reliant's concerns re EOL

Kevin:

As I mentioned in a voice mail a couple of weeks ago, Reliant has expressed some concerns about the current EnronOnline notification process for changes to power products.  My initial response after discussions with EnronOnline was to explain to Reliant that EnronOnline cannot change the notification process from them and to suggest alternative internal measures that Reliant can implement to monitor product changes.  (According to EnronOnline, no other objections to the notification process have been received by EOL.)   I had heard nothing else for a couple of weeks, and to date Reliant's use of EOL apparently has not been affected.  However, one of Reliant's attorneys, Dede Russo, called me yesterday to discuss the issue again.  I spoke with Rogers Herndon yesterday about Reliant's concerns, and Rogers perceives a real risk that Reliant will discontinue its use of EOL if we do not respond to their concerns.

I would like to discuss this issue with you briefly and suggest that we may want to meet with Savita Puthgai of EnronOnline to consider how best to respond to Reliant. 

Thanks,

Leslie

Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.   The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value.

I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate.

That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the
Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the cost basis)

sense?

The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated
based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the
market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is
valued OK, but the options are not.

In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in
the portfolio.

Kevin,

I know things are still pretty dynamic in the new organization, but I am ho=
ping I can speak with you about the possibility of any remaining power trad=
ing positions you might be looking to fill.  I know that several people wer=
e not retained in the NE, and my past Enron experience makes me a good cand=
idate to fill a trading role there.  I don't know if you remember me from b=
efore, but I spent time in Structuring as the lead Structurer for the UI de=
al, then Jim brought me over to work with Bill Reed and John Suarez on trad=
ing and marketing around the UI position in NEPOOL as well as PJM and NY (w=
hich had not really started trading at the time).  You and I never really h=
ad a chance to interact as we had no peaker assets in the regions in which =
I worked.  After EPMI I went to EBS, and most recently Jim asked me to go t=
o Singapore as the head of the trading and risk management function for our=
 Asia positions.  Currently I am working in the estate managing the termina=
ted power book for Racicot.
=20
In early November, when it was only EBS that was on its way to shutting dow=
n, I was in discussions with Dana about re-joining the EPMI team.  It sound=
ed as if there was a definite need and Dana seemed eager to bring me back o=
n the team.  I realize everything has changed since then, though I am still=
 hoping I can fill a need.  I have been attempting to sit down with Dana to=
 identify current and near term needs, but we have yet to meet up.  I want =
to make sure that some random timing issue doesn't negatively impact my pro=
spects of securing a spot, so I am hoping that now maybe I can discuss with=
 you any opportunities.  If there are not opportunities, then that is valua=
ble feedback as well so that I can appropriately direct my job search post-=
estate.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Kim -

Neil has decided to leave the company.  Neil says he is just burned-out and needs to help his parents for awhile and give some thought to his career.  Neil has agreed to help us through the 21st if we desire.  Can you help me work through the appropriate exit process for Neil.

Also, Brian Butler has decided to leave to take a position with Reliant.  Brian has been doing our day-to-day URM reporting for the past several months.  Brian was ranked a five and feels as though he/the group's obstacles have been underestimated.  Honestly, I have not heard anything but positives on this person and do not think we should let him just walk out.  I duscussed with him and he would very much like to stay with Enron, especially given some of the proposed personnel/structural changes we are undertaking.  Could you provide a summary of employee history on Brian so we can make a quick call - he is due to leave next week.

Thanks,

After talking with Rogers, it sounds like a conference call at 1:00 pm tommorow would be more productive.   Rogers and Don are still working through logistics of the move to the 6th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues.

Kevin,
The policy term runs through 4/1/02.  The deal reached with underwriters gives them 12 assets and a set premium which serves as a minimum for the risk.  They realize that the business plan is to sell assets (each foreign asset in the mix is also for sale) but the only way they would agree in light of the loss experience across our power book is if they were guaranteed a floor price for the buydown.    As the asset mix changes, there's no credit below this minimum. 
I'm sorry if this wasn't clear and we did attmept to to include a credit feature in anticipation of asset sales, but the market just wouldn't
accept it.

Kevin,

We spoke some time ago about a proposal to buy down deductibles for our power assets and I recall receiving your authorization to proceed as respects the New Albany plant.  To recap, the deductibles under the Enron Corp property and business interruption policy were increased at the last renewal from $500,000 per occurrence to $5 million per occurrence effective March 1. We were shopping a number of options to buy this deductible down to $1 million for property damage and 30 day waiting period for business interruption.  This coverage was bound effective June 12 (the reason for the time lag is extreme volatility in the insurance market for power assets) at an allocation of $345,000 for New Albany.  I also checked with Stuart and he sees no transactional issues relative to the buydown.
I understand that you have also purchased the dual trigger BI policy that effectively mitigates this initial 30 day waiting period exposure, so the BI coverage under the corporate program applies as a further risk mitigant for the catastrophic event. 

Since it's been awhile since our last conversation, I did want to reconfirm the buydown option and premium charge with you.
Please give me a call with any questions

David

Kevin -

Please listen for good NQ-02 quotes in these 2 markets.  We are flying blind in these areas and I am most uncomfortable here. 

Overall, we will be a little exposed to a gas rally (e.g. hurricane fears) due to our ercot position.  we are monitoring closely.  I do not think we are prepared to start buying gas yet as we need to work on our side to determine our position on an MMbtu equivalent basis.

Also,  will probably want to sit down with you and legal re: NRG early this week.  Spoke with their VP of trading and he really thinks this is a clear cut case for them and expressed no desire to negotiate.  In fact, I think they will try to elevate to higher levels as they essentially are saying we are renegging.  As I said before, they are planning a visit with Duran over the next week or so.  Let me know if you would like to visit with me and Andy Edison (inside legal) and have Louise join us too.

Thanks,
Rogers

Subject: NU CT-Long-Island Transmission Opportunity


Dan Staines and I met with NU's Transmission Business Unit yesterday to discuss their proposed transmission project connecting CT and Long Island.  In a nutshell, here are the details on the project (Dan can speak to greater technical details):

Run from Norwalk Harbor (CT) to Oyster Bay area of Long Island (Shore Rd substation) 
Minimum capacity of 330 MW;  are considering approximate doubling of the capacity 
Will be HVDC line, thereby facilitating flows in either direction and flexible scheduling 
They have started siting process (formal filing to be made this fall) and have commitments from key vendors (production slots secured, etc.) 
In order for the line to be workable, one of two things needs to happen:  (1) tansmission into the Southwest CT area needs to be beefed up; or (2) new generation needs to be placed at Norwalk Harbor.  As such, NU has proposed upgrades to the transmission system into Southweast CT (they are confident these upgrades can be accomplished without too much difficulty;  Dan believes it will be difficult)

They are planning on holding an "open season" for the transmission capacity (much as gas pipelines do), and are looking to get proposals by Aug 10, 2001.   In addition to basic fixed MW block purchase bids for a term of the bidder's preference (e.g., 100 MW for 5 years), they are interested in seeing alternative creative proposals.  The main objective of the open season is to secure sufficient transmission capacity sales contracts to get this project financed and built.
 
My hunch is that while they may get some healthy interest in capacity purchases, the bids will likely be shorter-term plays on the current congestion differential between CT and Long Island, and that they probably will not get a whole lot of long-term purchase bids to support raising project debt.  As such, I was thinking we might offer them a proposal something like the following:

Enron injects some level of debt or mezzanine funding to enable the project to lever up 
In return, Enron receives either or both of: (1) series of options to acquire firm (physical or financial) capacity rights on the line for multiple periods of, say, 5 years each; or (2) option to acquire an equity position in the line 
The options on the line could be made more valuable if we locked in optionality to develop new CCGT generation at or near Norwalk Harbor, thereby having the ability to deliver CC economics into the Long Island market  (I was speaking to CMEEC, and they indicate they have a site in the Norwalk area they want to develop)

What do you all think of this concept?   Do we have a desire to enter into a long-term purchase or option position on rights to the line?

Let's chat this up so we can determine what, if anything, we would like to submit to them on the 10th of August.  Please call either me or Dan to discuss.

Thanks

John

As we work to improve to our fundamentals, one of things we'd like to include is off-peak prices. We have a weekly production / burn report . Can I have acess to these prices? Who should I contact?
Also can i have access to the power structuring model and curves?

Gentlemen -

FYI, We have approximately 3.6 MM Mwh of net sales to New Power Company.  I am not sure what the p/l is but I think it is sizeable as most of these sales were made several months back.  I am not sure if this is on anyone's radar screen but is now on mine.  I will have the group look into p/l.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants


As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

Subject:	FYI - Progress Report on testing an EES deal in Enpower


To all,

The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.  

Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.

Quick statistics for ONE site:

Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book.
Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).
Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.
Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.
All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.

Recommendations:

Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc.
In the interim:

Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.
Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book).
Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application.
Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).
Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. 	


Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:

Week 1 (May 14-18)

Read Contract.
Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc.
Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions.
Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.

Week 2 (May 21-25)

Continue working on Full Requirements model.
Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.	
Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.
Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.
At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.

Week 3 (May 29-June 1)

Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month.
Again, we ran into problems with the test database.
Completed booking in Enpower.

Week 4 (June 4-5)

Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.
Discovered deal entry errors in booking.

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

For the 25th presentation, I need the following:

A pictorial description of power generation sources:	1) Nuclear
							2) Coal
							3) Resid Steam Unit
							3) Gas Combined Cycle
							4) Gas Simple Cycle
							5) Hydro

I would like to show annual demand by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) for the East, West, and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas.   A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful.   In addition, total capability by supply source

Some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton.

I am getting more like you every day.   Given what's going on in EES right now, I don't trust anyone.   Therefore, I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with.   Obviously, this includes Dale.   With respect to the rest of the EES group, I am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for Enron's shareholders.

Mr. Presto,
Your current fee is 1%. I called the PaineWebber online services. There is
no way to make the system reflect the fact that your NQ stock options don't
go below zero. I did create 2 new portfolios for you though. So now we have
the following:

Presto-ENRON: Lists all stock options along with their gain/loss(first on we
created)
Presto-Enron Restricted: Lists only your restricted shares
Presto-Enron3: Lists only those options that have a value greater than zero.
This portfolio, I can update monthly for you, or as often as you wish. This
is, I feel, the way that will give us the truest overall value of your stock
options, and it will also help us focus on the in the money options for
exercise purposes.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Hank Emery

         Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to

         The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total

         value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to
   get
         total
         portfolio value.

         I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was
      accurate.

            Mr. Presto,
            That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that
   the
            Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the
   cost
            basis)
            represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does
      that
            make
            sense?

            Thanks,
            Hank Emery

            The options are not valued properly.   The market value is
      calculated
            based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly
   overstates
      the
            market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of
   $0)
      is
            valued OK, but the options are not.

            In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not
   yet
      in
            the portfolio.

Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.
 
With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following:
1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.

Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).

Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.

The ESCA energy management system (EMS) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards.   We used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party "outsourcing/services" deals in ERCOT and SPP.
 
I hope this helps.

It is proposed that these will be transferred to the Netco.  The hardware and software were purchased by ENA or EPMI (I have been trying to obtain the answer to this question from accounting).  It is proposed that the $1.5 million outstanding payable to the vendor ESCA would remain with the estate.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.

Kevin

As I said in a previous email , Joe Murphy, CEO of Refco Global Futures and Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC will be here Thursday afternoon through dinner to further our discussions for providing a hosted marketplace where Enron would stream products with wider bid/offer and smaller volume to their "retail" customer base.  

The purpose of their visit is to firm up our discussion so that we can start drafting a term sheet for the deal.

I have carved out 1 hour this Thursday Oct 4 from 4:30 to 5:30pm in EB 27C2 to discuss the products that we currently make markets in and the volumes Refco currently handles for their customers.

Would you or someone in your group be interested in attending?  Several of the guys from the Oil & Refined products group will be there and I am waiting to hear if John Arnold or a representative of his will attend.  Let me know.

Regards

John Cummings

Thanks Mike please keep you eyes open for similar initiatives in other markets.

Corry,Don, Keith, & Theresa our objective in attending the sessions below is to identify the gaps between how we operate in the market today and what the new world will be.  Your focus should be on new tools and process that will be required.  Please coordinate any regulatory/market concerns about the MISO with Michael.

Cory please consider sending a rep for scheduling requirements.
Don please consider sending a rep for market trials and hourly requirements.
Keith please consider sending a rep for control area operations requirements.
Theresa please consider sending a rep for market trials requirements and possible settlement issues.

Please forward to others that would be interested.

The following  letter was sent today to the Midwest ISO Transmission Owners:
 
As we  move into the Market Trials period, I would like to reiterate how much the  Midwest ISO appreciates your support of our ongoing activities. 
To facilitate your participation in Market  Trials, we are providing two types of informative, interactive orientation  sessions.  One covers the  Electronic Scheduling Process and the other provides an overall Market  Trials Orientation.  These  sessions are designed to provide an essential overview of the drills, scenarios  and reviews necessary for your people to actively participate in the Market  Trials.
The Electronic Scheduling Process  session is available on three different dates in July and the overall Market  Trials Orientation session is offered on two different dates.  Because of the interactive nature of  these sessions the class size must be limited. Ideally, we would prefer no more  than two participants from each company. Please select the individual(s) from  your company who will attend these sessions, and forward the attached  registration brochure to them.   Please advise me if your needs exceed the requested attendance guideline  of two people per company. We will make every effort to accommodate your  request.
We recognize that asking you to sustain a  steady commitment of time, resources and manpower is an exacting demand.  Your confidence that your Market Trials  participants gain as much knowledge about the Midwest ISO's operational  abilities is equally important to us.
We are grateful for your continued support  of the Midwest ISO and look forward to working with you during the Market Trials  period. 
 
Sincerely,
