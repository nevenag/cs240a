Subject:	RE: Well hook up request

Pipeline: The proposed location would connect to TW's Leedy Lateral, this gas goes to Ivanhoe Dehy. then routes to Bushton processing.  All of our lines are mainlines; however, it is fair to say that the Leedy Lateral gas quality can be compared to that of gathering gas quality (dehydration is required).  The capacity at the Ivanhoe dehy needs to be checked to see if additional capacity would be available for the quantity that you have in mind.

Pressure:  MAOP of Leedy Lateral varies from 1125 to 1200 psi.  Operating pressures in the past year have been between 650 and 950 psig.

Cost: Approximate 4 on 16 hot tap costs would be between $60-75K.  We can price measuring/regulating facilities when expected volume is provided to Planning.

What would it cost?
Is it a Mainline or Gathering line that runs right by this well?
What is the TW line pressure?

Can I get an answer to the last 2 questions pretty quickly (by Wednesday Afternoon)?  The cost can come later.

Martina,

Howdy from Texas.

I am writing to see if you know where Christian has landed since the reorg. of EBS.  I'm glad to see you still have an Enron address.  

I was telling a friend about our trip to Denmark and that museum that we saw there.  

Please let me know if you know where Christian is.

Hope all is well,

Mark

Greg,
 
Welcome to Enron!  
 
 
We will immediately start the "development" program to instill the Enron viewpoint....We are the best and brightest employees and we are better and smarter than any company in the world.  We are the elite.
 
Just kidding.  I look forward to seeing you in the elevator banks.

	Mark: The following are certain Right-of-Way needs and/or questions.

	1. Are the ROW records located in Salt Lake City or Long Beach, CA?
	
	2. Does Questar have a ROW data base? If so, can they prepare a report, which would identify product limitation (i.e. Crude Oil specific), multiple line rights, pipeline size limitations, assignability, consent, etc.

	3. An Encroachment report.

	4. A Rental/Term report.

	5. A report identifying any known curative problems.

	6. Can they identify whether the following problems that existed in 1997 have been cured?
		
		a. BLM issues RE: Contract Purchasers vs. Land Patents
		b. Pipeline lies outside of defined R/W in certain locations
		c. Railroad licenses sold to municipal entities that may have required new terms and rental amounts
		d. Relocations
			i. Anaheim Hills
			ii. Morongo Indian Tribe (possible Union Pacific Railroad R/W longitudinal occupation vs. private)
		e. Franchise Agreements

	7. Will new pipe be required for connection of Four Corners pipeline to existing Transwestern pipeline system? If so, would this be across the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation in Mohave County, AZ?

	It is my understanding that this due diligence will not involve the balance of Arizona, which includes the Navajos', Hopis' and the Bennett Freeze area (disputed tribal lands). Is this correct?	 [McConnell, Mark]  YES, the West Leg only includes California.

Have a safe trip and don't get in too much trouble tonight.

Good luck to you guys.  I hope the game is a good as the hype.

Marissa,

Hey!  Just thinking about you.  I hope all is well out west.  Things here are sure interesting.  You should be very happy that you are not still here going through this stuff.  I feel pretty fortunate to be in the pipeline group.  This group is pretty lean so hopefully, there won't be many cuts (although I am the new boy in the group).  Many of the other groups are getting pretty anxious, including our former bunch.  We should find out pretty soon.

I was in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago and I called Rhondo.  He is working for the IOC and is in charge of all the fund raising for the Olympic charities.  It seems to be right up his ally.  He asked me to tell you hello.

Sarah and I took vacation last week.  I played golf in San Antonio (La Cantarra - in case Will is wondering - excellent course) and also played here in Houston with Frank, Marc and Bradford Brooks.  It was fun.

Please write back and let me know how you are doing.  How's the job, How's Will, How's LA, How was Thanksgiving...many questions.

Mark

Bill,

Attached is the confidentiality agreement that we are signing with Aquila.  It was originated out of our legal group but Aquila added:

	2. 	(iv)
	7.  	"for a period of two years."

I would like to use it for Reliant too.  Any problem with that?  Please let me know.

University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within 
the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT
campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.

Mr. Joergensen,

A big "Howdy" from your Texas friend.  

I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).  It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.  I hope you and your family are doing well.

As EBS changed direction, I did as well.  I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.  I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company).  I've been here for about a month and all is well.  The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).  It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.  I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.  Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.

I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.  It was a great concept and it worked.  Oh well.  We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.

Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.  Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.

It is a strange time here in America.  The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.  It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.  There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.

Take care Martin.  It was great to hear your voice.

Mark

I have arranged to take off this Friday, so I will be able to attend.  I guess I'll get the directions to the golf course and other details from Weed and Dial.  If the teams are all full, put me on their team.  Otherwise, I'll play with anyone.  My game has gone down the tubes since I started the international work.  I hope to take care of that problem soon.....put me down as a 24 handicap.

I look forward to seeing you and the rest of the guys,

Mark

Yeah,  Baylor this weekend and Nebraska next.  This Baylor game is coming at the right time.  Good luck with Colorado.

I think he is probably making the right call; however, y'all are rolling right now and haven't lost this year.  I'm not sure it is wise to tweak the machine now....then again, you can't argue with a coach on a 19 game winning streak.

Is the OU/NU game next weekend?

Man I hear you.  I have faith in Stoops but I am a little worried.  On the other hand, our offense certainly hasn't dominated anyone this year.  It is a question of what to go with; productive with mistakes or less productive and fewer mistakes.

Subject:	RE: WOW

I really can't believe things happened the way they did.  I thought everything was set for you guys to get another opportunity for the national championship.  I also thought the case for Roy Williams to win the Heisman would become really strong.  I didn't get to watch the OU-OSU game, but I received about 30 phone calls the last two minutes of the game.

I am excited that some breaks have gone our way, but it will be difficult to beat CU twice in one season.  Also, I am not sure that I want to ever play Miami after seeing them the last two weeks.

Don't be too upset, you guys are going to be tough next year and you are riding a two year win streak on us right now....(11-0 would sound a lot better than 10-1).

I'll be heading to Dallas early Saturday morning.  

Take care,
Zac

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Pat,

Howdy!!!!

What is going on?  I heard from Erica that she may have some decisions to make soon.  Are you going through the same thing?  I'm interested to know.

I heard from Andy Maus last week.  He is doing some contract work for Enron.  He and his family are enjoying Denver.

Please call or email me.

I hope all is well.

FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS T=
RANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA=
TION

09/27/2001=20
Foster Natural Gas Report=20
Page 7=20
(c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.=20
FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain co=
nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe=
en PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various ship=
pers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t=
ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple=
s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.=20
The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among=
 other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity ava=
ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why=
 its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat=
e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat=
ed rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu=
rther explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its =
tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati=
on of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity=
 on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it c=
an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti=
me.=20
Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier=20
FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently=
 arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject =
of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Trans=
western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transa=
ctions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject=
 to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued =
data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 orde=
r, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr=
ansactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the =
negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would n=
ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp=
ers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactio=
ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short =
time.=20
In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore=
 Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market=
 price differentials between the California border and producing basins in =
New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading=
 Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant=
 Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2=
7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl=
uding surcharges and fuel.=20
In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc=
rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu=
ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: "Did Trans=
western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und=
er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate=
d rate charges at substantially higher rates?" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10=
.)=20
Background=20
Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to =
its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-=
1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian=
t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens=
erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener=
gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus=
pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,=
 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti=
ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip=
eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric=
 Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or=
egon-California border.=20
According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w=
ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum=
 FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of =
surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at =
the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. =
The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu=
estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit=
y may be available on the GTN system.=20
GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew =
service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t=
o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.=
 Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on =
the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations=
.=20
Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:=
=20
- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity=
 arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem=
pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. =
Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to=
 pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re=
verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c=
apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t=
hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that =
the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th=
e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate=
, or the Southern California border market.=20
- Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco=
urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested=
 it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind=
ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the =
cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believe=
d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it "a prici=
ng opportunity."=20
- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t=
he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volu=
me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a=
nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M=
MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20
- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 o=
rder.=20
- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t=
han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim=
e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi=
rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi=
eld to Malin.=20
- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe=
rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo=
sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r=
efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta=
ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i=
t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate=
.=20
FERC Has Serious Concerns=20
According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions und=
er investigation "present several serious concerns." Even with the addition=
al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man=
y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he=
aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran=
sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann=
er consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t=
he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity =
that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t=
o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp=
ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa=
ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in=
 the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima=
ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains=
t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als=
o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20
Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's =
posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca=
pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak=
e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap=
acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is=
 awarded.=20
Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other =
negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities avail=
able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Se=
mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0=
00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec=
ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th=
e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com=
mission surmises.

Jonathan,

Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.  I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.

Your resume looks very impressive.  I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.

I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.

Best of luck,

Mark

Dennis,

To follow up from our meeting today, please provide the delivery report that includes the following:

WHAT	Total volumes (by month) delivered to primary delivery points versus alternate delivery points
WHEN	For the period of 5/00 thru 10/31
WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)
WHO	Send to William Rapp (legal), Kim Watson and myself

This information will be used to respond to criticism by the California PUC.  I believe that Bill Rapp is wanting to respond by early Wednesday so if he could get these numbers by end of day Monday, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

Mark
This is Planning's response to your request of 10/10/2001 regarding two new gas wells hook up into TW's system.
The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station.
The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Are they interested to build up to 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If they are what is pressure/maximum volume that this well can produce?


Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile to TW-Crawford 16" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig.
Can this well meet TW's line pressure ? what is the maximum flow rate on this well?


Please share this information with your customer and let me know about your response on this project? 

   
Mansoor

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:
Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure I get it right.
I would appreciate any help.

Subject:	Tans Pecos scenarios



The following 2 scenarios were run and meet our return requirements.  The total volume of 306 comes from the 240 suggested starting volumes and the additional volumes come from expiring El Paso/MGI transportation agreements.

_______________________________

1)  306 total volume

240 @ $.2479 for yrs 1-15
26 @ $.2479 for yrs 3-15
40 @ $.2479 for yrs 4-15

2)  306 total volume

240 @ $.2600 for yrs 1-15
26 @ $.1883 for yrs 3-15
40 @ $.1883 for yrs 4-15
_______________________________


We would suggest Showing PEMEX either scenario but using the round numbers of $.25 (instead of $.2479) for scenario 1 and $.19 (instead of $.1883) for scenario 2.

Please let me know if you have a preference.  We would like to fax one of these scenarios to Jorge @ 3:00 today so that they can digest it and use it for a starting point for tomorrow's meeting.

Call me if you have any questions.

Erica,

It sounds like you have the right attitude about the situation (I wouldn't have guessed otherwise).  The fun aspect of it is that you can do whatever you want.  Sometimes the hard thing is figuring out what that is.  I truly wish you the best and I certainly want to know where you place yourself.

Oh, I heard from Andy.  They have settled in Denver and he is still looking for a job but he may do some contract work for Enron.  I'm not sure how definite it is or what he'll be doing.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Mark

Monday night and Tuesday?  Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.  I told him yes but I needed to check with you.  I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.   I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.  Let me know if this interferes with any plans or if you don't think you'll be seeing enough of me.

ps  I've left a message for Greg with the receptionist from his group.  I still don't know if he is here.

Man I hear you.  I have faith in Stoops but I am a little worried.  On the other hand, our offense certainly hasn't dominated anyone this year.  It is a question of what to go with; productive with mistakes or less productive and fewer mistakes.

Mark,

I hope you have enjoyed your time working in Europe as much as I did.  I have recently made a switch and I left the broadband group and joined the Transwestern Pipeline Marketing team.

I'll talk to you later,

Mark

Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.

With some kind guidance from the veterans around here, I'd be glad to do it.  If it can wait a couple of days.

Looking for a volunteer to market TW to this new power plant so that they will take the supplies off our pipe.  Any takers?

Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

Christian,

How's it going in Brazil?  I know you are happy to be back.

I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business.  I'm working for the pipeline group.  The people here are very nice and I'm glad to be back in this industry.  Although, I must say that I will miss London and working with people like yourself.

I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day.  Do you happen to know his email address?  Please let me know.

I hope all is well down south.

Mark

Howdy Heidi,

Well, your name is still on the list so that is good.  I hope all is well with you and your hubby.

Awfully weird times here in the home office.  Really strange vibes all over the building...people wondering about their jobs, sad about their retirement accounts and wonderment about how a proud (maybe too proud) Fortune 10 company could go down in ~3 weeks.  I guess it is the same or similar there too.

The pipeline group is working out.  I really like the people and am starting to get comfortable with the business and my regulated surroundings.

Please respond and let me know what you are up to and how you are doing.  I'm so sorry we didn't hook up when you were in town last time.

Mark
