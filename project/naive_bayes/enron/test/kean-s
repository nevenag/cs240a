PM To	Kean Steven J Subject	FW Tavel advisory  France - I thought you and Jim might like this -----Original Message-----From 	Duvauchelle Antoine Sent	Monday October 08 2001 722 AM To	Shapiro Richard Subject	Tavel advisory  France - I thought you and Jim might like this  The following advice for American travellers going to France was compiled  from information provided by the US State Department the CIA the US  Chamber of Commerce the Food and Drug Administration the Centres for  Disease Control  and some very expensive spy satellites that the French dont know about  It  is intended as a guide for American travellers only  General Overview  France is a medium-sized foreign country situated in the continent of  Europe It is an important member of the world community though not  nearly  as important as it thinks  It is bounded by Germany Spain Switzerland and some smaller nations of  no  particular importance and with not very good shopping France is a very  old  country with many treasures such as the Louvre and Eurodisney Among its  contributions to western civilization are champagne Camembert cheese and  the guillotine  Although France likes to think of itself as a modern nation air  conditioning is little used and it is next to impossible for Americans to  get decent Mexican food One continuing exasperation for American visitors  is that local people insist on speaking in French though many will speak  English if shouted at Watch your money at all times  The People  France has a population of 56 million people 52 million of these drink  and  smoke the other 4 million are small children All French people drive  like lunatics are dangerously oversexed and have no concept of standing  patiently in a queue  The French people are in general gloomy temperamental proud arrogant  aloof and undisciplined those are their good points Most French citizens  are Roman Catholic though you would hardly guess it from their behaviour  Many people are communists  Men sometimes have girls names like Marie or Michel and they kiss each  other when they meet American travellers are advised to travel in groups  and wear baseball caps and colourful trousers for easier recognition  Safety  In general France is a safe destination although travellers must be  aware  that from time to time it is invaded by Germany Traditionally the French  surrender immediately and apart from a temporary shortage of Scotch  whisky  and increased difficulty in getting baseball scores and stock market  prices life for the American visitor generally goes on much as before A  tunnel  connecting France to Britain beneath the English channel has been opened  in  recent years to make it easier for the French government to flee to London  during future German invasions  History  France historical figures are King Louis the Huguenots Joan of Arc  Jacques Cousteau and Charles de Gaulle who was President for many years  and is now an airport The French were never very imaginative and all  their  kings were called Louis The French enjoyed their Revolution which set up  their republic It was so successful that they did it again and again and  again  Government  The French form of government is democratic but noisy Elections are held  more or less continuously and always result in a draw  The French love administration so for government purposes the country is  divided into regions departments districts municipalities towns  communes villages cafes and telephone kiosks Each of these has its own  government and elections Parliament consists of two chambers the Upper  and Lower though confusingly they are both on the ground floor and whose  members are either Gaullists or Communists neither of whom should be  trusted by the traveller  Parliaments principal occupation is testing atomic bombs in the south  Pacific and acting indignant and surprised when other countries complain  and then complaining when the Arabs do the same in Paris According to the  most current American state department intelligence the President is now  someone named Jacques Further information is not available at this time  Culture  The French pride themselves on their culture though it is not easy to see  why All their music sounds the same and they have never made a movie that  you would want to watch for anything but the nude scenes  Cuisine  Lets face  it no matter how much garlic you put on it a snail is just a  slug with a shell on its back Croissants on the other hand are  excellent  although it is impossible for most Americans to pronounce this word In  general travellers are advised to stick to cheeseburgers  Economy  France has a large and diversified economy second only to Germanys in  Europe which is surprising because the French hardly work at all If they  are not spending four hours dawdling over lunch they are on strike and  blocking the roads with their trucks and tractors Frances principal  exports in order of importance to the economy are wine nuclear weapons  perfume guided missiles champagne guns grenade launchers land  minestanks attack aircraft miscellaneous armaments and cheese Rick I have been forwarded this message quite to my surpriseconsidering my reputation  I should probably not have sent this to you but I will concede to the humour I hope you will have fun -Antoine  Public Holidays  France has more holidays than any other nation in the world Among its 361  national holidays are 197 Saints days 37 National Liberation Days 16  Declaration of Republic Days 54 Return of Charles de Gaulle in triumph as  if he won the war single-handed Days 18 Napolean sent into Exile Days 17  Napolean Called Back from Exile Days and 2 France is Great and the Rest  of  the World is Rubbish Days  Conclusion  France enjoys a rich history a picturesque and varied landscape and a  temperate climate In short it would be a very nice country if it was not  inhabited by French peopleThe best thing that can be said for France is  that it is not Germany

PJM has its own approach see below  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years Option 2-M of the Business Plan   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 Option 3-M of the Business Plan We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December 2002 but no later than May 2003  Although we Enron believe PJMs November 2003 time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option 3-M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable As noted above the Judge endorses Option 1-M in part because it has a built-in a process for determining Best Practices  Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support  However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM  The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page 18 Governance The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance  interim governance final governance board make-up and stakeholder process  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option  Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs  5 from PJM 3 from New York and 2 from New England  The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system Post Mediation The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment  We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned even conservative approach to reaching that goal  Therefore even though the Judge sided with New York we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report Sarah Dan Howard and Tom

Francisco Chronicle 20 URL httpwwwsfgatecomcgi-binarticlecgifile3Dchroniclearchive20 010704MN186091DTL 20 Officials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal re gulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly impos ed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of bla ckouts in the two states20 The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling black outs yesterday afternoon and one day after the first-ever rolling blackout s in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduc e air conditioning20 The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take  a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revis ions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during s hortages20 We need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for t he California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of  dollars to keep the states lights on20 Generators need to be held accountable he said20 The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet  power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rat es during periods of high demand20 Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the ex pense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that electrici ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost20 No ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an e nergy-industry association in Menlo Park20 Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was  no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont rols are in effect20 This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no t having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts20 BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at 145 pm yesterday when  power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert ab out an hour later after finding additional supplies20 Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle  a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversee s the states power network20 The Golden States latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li ghts20 Don Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said tha t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Mondays shortage20 Were looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potenti al for unintended consequences20 Specifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less - efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishin g under capped prices20 Were going to see how the caps might have played into this he said20 The federal ceiling in 10 Western states excluding California is about 9 2 per megawatt hour In California a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the states credit risk bringing the price to just over 10120 Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha ve extended Californias power crisis to neighboring states20 California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said 20 LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES20 California and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith t hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit hhold output20 The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources20 Unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal r egulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let suppl y and demand determine costs20 Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac k on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line nu mber provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emerge ncies20 No one answered he said They were closed20 State officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the com mission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for wh en the commission might come up with a response20 E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarussfchroniclecom 20 2001 San Francisco Chronicle    Page A - 120 Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls By Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer Published July 3 200120 Confused by the federal governments new controls on electricity prices ge nerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state wa s nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said20 The confusion began when the states electric grid operators declared a Sta ge 1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the  first time since they went into effect June 2120 Out-of-state generators pulled about 1500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon enough to power about 11 million homes because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for  the state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity fo r the states financially distressed utilities20 They didnt understand what they were going to be paid there was confusio n over the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw 1500 megawatts disappear 20 The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced Ca lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said Roll ing blackouts hit southern Nevada20 Most California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a varia ble price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark et But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting p rofits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity A nd as Mondays episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap  will fall could lead to unexpected shortages20 Thats the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur ODonnell  editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind of certainty at all20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import s from the Bonne07ville Power Administration the federal agency that mark ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The s tate went into a Stage 2 power alert the next-to-last level before blackou ts are ordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 820 FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West The pr ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p lant operating in California during a power alert declared by the Indepen dent System Operator which runs the states power-transmission grid When  theres no alert prices cant exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ ished during the latest alert20 Until Monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatt-hour i n California But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte rnoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many Calif ornia power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew by h ow much until the price was posted by the ISO20 The ceiling for California fell to about 77 at 3 pm but was back up to  98 in two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the 10 percent  premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said theres a cred it risk in selling to the state20 ODonnell said its likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t ime the ISO declares a power alert20 In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO Bu t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the ou t-of-staters that were pulling back Hidalgo said20 The Bees Dale Kasler can be reached at 916 321-1066 or dkaslersacbeeco m 20 Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs20 Electricity Confused suppliers unsure what they will be paid refuse to s ell to state which asks FERC for a ruling but doesnt get it20 By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer20 SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af ternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials said The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su pply more than 1 million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the stat es electricity since January At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us t hat since they dont know what theyre going to get paid theyre not going to take the risk and so theyre not going to sell the energy Hart said The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency m eaning reserves had dipped below 7 It was the first such emergency since  May 31 Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a power e mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th e most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price  is supposed to be established under the commissions order and that appare ntly drove away sellers Hart said Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 130 pm putting the old price limit of 90 per megawatt-hour in question companies that h ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate Forced to dip even deeper into the states power reserves and declare  a Stage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy commi ssions hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh en it should take effect They got no answer Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar ify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations power s uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when i t is set will probably be lower than 90 per megawatt-hour because the pri ce of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped la tely Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators  had anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in  part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had agr eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this  summer Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through Hart said 20 Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times20 James D Steffes 07062001 1004 PM

Vikas  File AAProgramCommentsdoc 20 Comments from MBA Class 2000 109We need to reconcile the difference between ENEs salaries vs competit ors and other Houston companies 209We need better guidance in the rotation selection Ive seen lot of go od people being screwed because choosing a bad area to work due to lack of  information 309Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not the Program itsel f is staffed in a very amateur manner  There are a few really good people  but for the most part it is just not professionally run  Calls unanswered lots of passing the buck and general disorganization 409If they have resources they do a poor job of communicating them  Whi le we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves there should be an a ctive effort to point us to those resources 509Compensation  The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being l ocked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance  At  the very least this is a serious oversight 20 609PRC  Really doesnt work  Not an apple to apples comparison  Heavil y dependent on whenwhere you rotated 709I could care less about Enrons reputation  I tried paying my student loans with reputation but they only accepted cash  How much money can I make at this place assuming the stock price doesnt double every few month s in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay my compensation 20 809Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in term s of the PRC where before Enron was penalizing the have issues classific ation of the PRC now it feels like they are trying to get rid of 20 of th e pool Reinforcing the first paragraph 909Offer of salary is cloaked and we dont know where we can end up 1009I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the h ead office As a result the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false e xpectations And obviously when those expectations are not met we all know the consequences 1109The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much high er base 1209Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against  I s it really Wall Street and consulting  If so Id like to see the names o f the firms  New York is not that expensive that the well theyre in New  York excuse covers all discrepancies  It feels like we must be benchmarki ng against second or third tier MBA recruiters 1309Theres a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a s ecure established money making division in order to guarantee a average o r above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom  brackets and not be fired  That goes against the long- term reputation of  Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks20 1409Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others ro tating but do not expect to get displaced by a 1st rotation associate that  is placed by the AA pool 1509Assignment of 1st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was more of an analyst function than it was an associate function  Why cant  alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the in coming candidate 1609Manage expectationsdont need to hear about 26 year old trader and Louise Kitchens rise to fame with Enron Onlinecreates an expectation t hat those are more common occurrences than they really are 1709It doesnt feel like theres a lot to do in all areas nonetheless so mething between 60 and 100 new associates coming in these fall First why  that many  Second do they know what they are getting into 1809The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market  - we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up  for the disparity but given the declining stock value lack of meaningful  rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the progra m this is becoming a much bigger issue 1909Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea wha t the upside looks like  Working for beans in year 1 is ok if years 2-5 ar e excellent  We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus aft er the program is over 2009Salary well below market base salary and value of optionsbonus - e ven if they bring us up to the 2001 offers which are rumored to be under m arket we have 1 year or more experience with the class coming in and will be paid the same amount 2109Lack of quality rotations cuts in EBS EES ect 2209Level of responsibility is well below expectationsmaturity level 2309Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top B-Schools  Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting but also compared to specialties brand management etc that are at the lower end of the M BA scale  It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not i ndexed by location  Other energy companies here in town even pay more 20 2409The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and no t carrots  There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of a signing bonus 18 months after the start date  If the Program is truly s pecial people should not be forced to repay anything-Enron should deliver w hat they advertise and people will stay  The 18-month lock up period sugge sts a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associ ate and not an improvement in the Program20 2509How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual pe rformance levels  Ive got no clue but Im wondering why it such a big sec ret20 2609The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rota tions as Enron implies  For example if you take a rotation in an area you know nothing about you will lose in the PRC because you are still learnin g the job  Similarly if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation y ou will be rewarded a PRC time 2709There are too many associates and too few analysts   Too many associ ate rotations become exercises in finding something to do  Too often asso ciates think to themselves I remember doing this several years ago as an u ndergrad why am I doing this again 2809They should present the program for what it is -an internal labor poo l where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available  and who they know  The Program does not match people with jobs and should  make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs etc upon entry into t he program  This is not because they want Associates to have choice but r ather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations  20 2909If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting  we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors  I dont k now what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not k eeping up  Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the progra m  When a person who didnt get into Enron but got into a competitor makes materially more money from the start people start believing they have jus t been sold a lot of hype 3009Not enough development during rotations - even associates who end up  learning a lot dont necessarily enjoy their rotations because they dont f eel part of the team 3109Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your fir st rotation is a moral buster as well  Additionally it can waste a lot of time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have no interest in 3209Compensation - many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower ba se and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised l arge equity based compensation  Also it was very difficult to find out wh at full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process  Most wrongl y believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus oth er leading MBA avenues  How much money do people at Enron make assuming th e stock price performs1 Great 2 Okay 3 Poor 20 3309Responsibility - when you are getting recruited you always here the L ouise Kitchen John Arnold and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal We need to stop doing that  Enrons slowing growth rate and failure in e verything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we look more and more like a large corporation 20 3409The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let  them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out  I f this is true why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in f ewer higher quality associates from the start - the process of weeding out leaves everyone with a bad feeling  More importantly you probably lose m ore good people then you realize 3509Trading trading trading  On MBA campus visits Enron gives the imp ression that there are lots of corporate development  MA finance and ot her similar assignments available at Enron  The reality seems that if you  are not interested in trading for a living you are not on the companys ma in commercial track any longer 3609Finding a Rotation Information difficult to get it is all networkin g This is fine but I dont consider the AA progrram a resource in this a rea at all If no one else does we should cut any expenses they are incurr ing for rotation placement 3709The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale  You can reward the high  performers without penalizing the good performers  Recently the word has  gotten around 09that the top 5 and the next 15 of the PRC group got very large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses  This distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger numb er of unhappy people 3809I find it interesting that Enron chooses to 1- adopt a business mode l based upon free-market economics and 2- pride itself on its intellectual capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial serv ices player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence  In sel ecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point  I find it paradoxical h owever that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be desc ribed as socialistic and below market  In a labor market where intellectu al capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive  advantage in the form of this asset I can only believe that Enron is posit ioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J Aron Morgan Stanl ey Dynegy El Paso etc decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on En ron is to higher this intellectual capital  Without griping I feel if not hing else workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talen ts we possess  In our sales pitch we are told that Enron benchmarks pay  against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street   I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a cand le to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package which leaves me bi tter that the sales pitch was shallow fell short or was deliberately misg uided  Part of the problem from an Associates perspective stems from Enr on promising the moon and then falling short on delivery  Like a company t hat fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market punishment for such a s hortfall is swift and severe  I truly believe Enron is setting itself up f or such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly 3909In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics an d socialistic patronage I have come to notice that more and more departmen ts are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the A ssociate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months  Fu rther many desks once happy with the performance of the Associate ask fo r the option to retain the Associate  However no effort is made to comp ensate the Associate for essentially giving up the optionality embedded i n a rotational program  In fact many choosing to stay within a group have made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time they have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead o pting to join a unit full time  By removing the ability of business units  to promote a worker until conclusion of the 18-24 month period hard workin g good-fit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would see m to be a natural fit for a full-time position and the chance to alleviate a significant source of discontent-COMPENSATION- which could be addressed  through the immediate promotion to the Manager level  By allowing for prom otion Associates could earn enhanced compensation and department heads co uld address hiring needs  Rather Associates leave a unit disgruntled fee ling they are marking time in other units potentially passing up an altern ative that may be of great interest  Additionally a number of Commercial  units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are  in their third or fourth rotation so as to retain a call option on an em ployee that has run out of rotation alternatives  This practice CANNOT be  in the best interest of the Desks the Program or for that matter Enron   By pigeonholing employees in this matter the significance and importance o f rotations is greatly diminished as is our work experience  This is just ludicrous  Department heads arent looking to hire externally because of  the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade  Rather they are trying to  plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary  Again rather than pay a competitive performance-based wage Enron has adopted a tight-fiste d socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses  Ultimately this will l ead to people seeking to rotate out of Enron for the compensation the mar ket will bare  20 4009I think AA provides an excellent opportunity to find the department  that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job  chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates than for  regular employees 4109We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go - I doubt many of the guys who went to NY had this 4209We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce 4309Salaries Not in line with market 4409Mentors Not encouraged throughout the organization20 4509Recruiting Disorganized not enough student focus trying to compete with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries sometimes unprofess ional conduct rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and  gave message you are not good enough 4609Summer Intern Program Not well coordinated20 4709Rotation Length Keep flexibility 6 mos sometimes too short other t imes too long disincents management to include Associates in longer term meatier projects 4809When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited 4909Overall Enron has a great group of people to work with 5009Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds ethnicity and natio nalities within the company 5109Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere 5209Overall Enron has an excellent overall company image 5309I do not have too many comments My main problem with the last team w as that they were extremely rigid - rigid start date rigidity in assigning groups etc Old group did one-way dialogues they would not even listen  The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen - these are two thi ngs I feel are most important in running such program 5409Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friend s that graduated with me from my business school  They wanted still want to work for Enron I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a res ponse I believe she left Enron I then contacted Patricia Payton Several emails phone calls and still havent heard from her Its frustrating dea ling with the HR dept 5509PRC is not a trusted mechanism  Few people in the program understand it fully no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings and no one bel ieves the results are truly equitable  Politics appears to play as much of a role as performance if not more so in determining rankings  Further  groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r anked people  For as much as individuals success depends upon this rankin g and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be that policy is incredibly inconsistent 5609We are under market for compensation - everyone knows this regardles s of what the program people say  It is common knowledge that at least Rel iant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and b onus  The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incomin g participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries fl at and was not well received obviously 5709Rotation placement service is not very useful  The best way to find  a good rotation remains through networking 5809The experience talent and character of the associate pool continue  to be excellent 5909Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with  virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing  Comeraderie a mong the class is widespread and genuine 6009The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right d irection 6109Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain in ternal communication and networking within each associate class and to crea te new networks between individual associate classes  Efforts by individua l associates to affect this have not been supported 6209Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered  particularly as rotation time approaches  This would facilitate informal d iscussion about opportunities and business unit activity  Additionally it  would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rota tions and introduce those interested to potential future managers 6309Compensation is clearly an issue  Whether the compensation gap exist s in reality or it only exists in perception there is a widespread belief  that Enron is under-compensating associates relative to both other firms in the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets a re employed  This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severel y underwater options  Base salary should be addressed 6409Again whether perception or reality associates are concerned about  selecting rotations in groups that are not making money  The belief is tha t bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units  The refore it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable gro up regardless of the skill development it may offer 6509The mandatory eighteen-month service period before eligibility for pr omotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers 6609What happened to the AA publication 6709There is no source available that provides a history of individual as sociates who have rotated through specific jobs  It would be very benefici al to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for first-hand  information on business units of interest 6809My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the respons ibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into t he group  Once in I know of several people including myself that get a wh ole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations prior to joining that group  Furthermore I believe that Associates get w ork that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degr ee  This is very frustrating because once your in your in and you cant g et out for 6 months  On top of that you get PRC reviews based on work tha t was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assess ment can be made 20 6909Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyon e  But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were up front with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate  In addition  it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very very poorly by their new groups  This has not been the case for me but I know people th at have voiced these thoughts and opinions - so I am speaking for them inca se they are too nervous to put it into writing 7009That is about it  I would like to see some education come out of the Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron as well as som e greater insight to particular groups and the expectations 7109When Enron recruited us it was so different from what it is now  So many diverse opportunities were out there  Now Enron is heading towards  a pure trading house  It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rota tion out of trading  But you dont need an MBA to be a trader  In fact A ssociates often work for analysts on the trading side and we dont have an y special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the tradi ng side  It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about getting the n ext rotation at El Paso 7209A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly and six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first and  then make meaningful contributions  Some people think it is worthwhile to  groom Associates even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts who are  supposed to be there longer  It is sometimes difficult for Associates to g et meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us 7309Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competit ors 7409The companys direction has changed drastically from the one I interv iewed for in November 2000 some of these strategies seem shortsighted and  in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in th e energy business in the long term specifically 7509The stated strategy of exiting all generation exploration and trans portation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the compa ny and earns us a banking multiple on the street  Also with additional pl ayers entering the gas and power markets in a major way how can we expect  to continue to grow and maintain our current market share 7609Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures including Azurix Enron International Dabhol EBS and EES  The failures of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not b een totally priced in to our stock price  Bottom line there does not appe ar to be any large areas of growth within the company 7709Pay When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from 250 00 to 40000 dollars more to do the same job it doesnt make you feel very intelligent to be working here  Additionally when I accepted this positi on I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and what the determinants are of the annual bonus  What I have heard through  the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to beli eve during recruiting  Not having any assistance and having attended a top East coast school I am almost 100000 dollars in debt  I was counting o n the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck  but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I w orked as an engineer in manufacturing 7809I dont see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analys ts and Associates It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salari es but it is also a waste of years of experience in the case of Associat es  It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the P rogram gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units Be certai n the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associ ate 7909If you look at AA as human capital we at Enron are very long in bac kground experience and knowledge The AA Program is Regulation using En ron terminology from rotation assignments to payments I see pretty logic al the consequences a lot of inefficiencies waste of energy the lack of  objectivity poor motivation or even frustration in general performance is far away from excellent Add some flexibility to the Program let the peop le choose their rotations and move without restrictions Let them also nego tiate working conditions salaries and career path with the business unit 8009PRC is unfair I consider offensive writing in a maximum of 5 lines 6 months of accomplishments I dont think a PRC Committee can better assess the performance than the business unit 360-degree evaluations and peers  review are ok  Re-think the need of a committee and a ranking of AA assig ned to so different business units 8109I feel free to choose for a second rotation I like the way you can a pproach a new business unit introduce yourself have an interview and gath ered information about the business and your position Things may change af ter that and you get stacked in that place for at least 6 months Keep allo wing people to search and move freely from HR 8209Make staff more accountable  Online based  Much like the IT departm ent where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure  of with any comments 8309Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Man ager  Not communicated at all 8409Tell people that their first rotations are assigned  Also not commun icated 8509I wish I had a PRC suggestion but I need to think about it 8609Dont insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money but putting it in a bonus so you dont have to give us raises  If you wan t to do that give me the courtesy of being up front about it 8709Some kind of database maybe there is one that I dont know about of openings  Would be pretty cool 8809Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors - at the  least so it is equal 8909Make the development and support of associates a more important crite rion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents  The commer cial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely 9009Reduce the size of each incoming class - make the program special aga in  Right now I cant believe the broad spread in ability and experience  in the associate class  I guarantee the spread is not that high in other t op tier firms that hire MBAs 9109With the smaller size assign a lead commercial person to a group of  5 associates  The lead commercial person a director or VP would keep in  touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the  most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them 9209Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these  groups know when they need a clerk analyst or associate  Too often we tr eat analysts clerks and 30-year-old associates with 6-8 years of experien ce the same  This happens way too much 9309The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer  to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they  want to take and design a plan on how to get them there

Education Dear Steven Kean I am contacting you directly because you are the leader of Enrons educational initiatives  I am hoping you will take a few minutes to allow me to introduce myself and my company  I am sure you do not appreciate unsolicited mail therefore I apologize for this intrusion but I believe I you will be interested in what I have to say I am a founder in a fairly new company that is focused on a new technology for education  We are building one-on-one relationships between major companies and universities  We are not a distance learning company  We do not provide content  We simply provide a unique platform for people to communicate with each other over great distances as though everyone involved were sitting in the same room My goal today is to provide you with information that could allow Enron to have direct links into university classrooms  The possibilities include having Enron executives and managers attend a Stanford MBA program without having to travel to Palo Alto or attend a Harvard executive program without having to leave the workplace  Our plan is simple Enron picks the school of its choice we install digital classrooms at the school and at Enron  Through the use of digital technology these classrooms now become one  Enron employees now attend the same class in real time that is being taught at a school or university  The additional benefits to Enron are many less time lost all travel expenses saved employee moral and retention to name a few  This also allows key executives to upgrade their skills that would normally not want to be away from their job and family My company Telanetix is building a network of virtual or digital classrooms around the country to link major universities with major corporations  Our digital classrooms are unlike anything you have seen  They appear as well appointed lecture rooms but the front and back walls are high resolution video screens There are no visible cameras or microphones  Everyone in each room sees everyone else people are life-sized there is no latency sound is directional no panning or zooming is used etc  The technology is transparent to the participants and this allows them to concentrate on each other  The impression of the participants is that they are all in one large room  No training is required to use the roomall that is required is for the participants to enter the room and start talking The digital classrooms are so real in its effect that this technology is being readily accepted among elite school as a means for distant education  All classes or programs are exactly the same as being taught on campus today  Prospective students still apply to the college of choice and are admitted through the same process as students who plan to attend class on campus  All programs will have the full acceptance and accreditation of the school where the classes originate When it is all said and done Telanetix becomes invisible  We simply link the likes of Stanford Harvard and MIT directly into corporate training centers  Enron employees would interact directly with the University and pay their tuition to the University  Telanetix collects its fees from the University and not the students This technology is up and operating  Our partner TeleSuite Dayton Ohio has established about 25 conference rooms around the country with companies such as IBM 3COM CIGNA Price Waterhouse Coopers and AOL-Time Warner  The University of Arizona and Duke University also have rooms  The University of Arizona is using a prototype of a teaching room to conduct two Executive MBA programs in the Silicon Valley 3COM from their Tucson campus  Duke uses the technology to communicate on administrative issues with their campus in Frankfurt Germany  Telanetix anticipates installing classrooms at Stanford University and the University of Maryland in the near future  Additionally we are linking overseas sites to this network in England and Australia This technology is new and cutting-edge  I hope Enron will consider joining the small but growing list of companies that are bringing tier one education directly into the workplace In addition to using the digital classroom for higher education all our business customers are using them for virtual conference rooms usually between executives in different locations  IBM for example has five of these rooms and is ordering five more because they have proven to be very cost effective as a means to reduce travel  Why  Because the conferencing is so profoundly real in its effect that the users feel as if they are all present in the same room  This is not video-conferencing  This is way beyond that As executive vice president and chief of staff for Enron I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to read this  I believe that we have a value proposition for Enron to consider  I would very much like to demo our digital classroom to you and discuss the benefits and possibilities it might bring  Below I have attached a few pictures of the digital classroom For more information please visit our web site at wwwtelanetixcom httpwwwtelanetixcom  I look forward to your response Sincerely Steve

 and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status -carry their passport Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times We would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent  Resident  Green  Card as proof of their status as a precautionary  measure   It  appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry hisher registration  documentation  with  them at all times This can include  a  Permanent  Resident Card Form I-94 card Employment Authorization   Card  Border  Crossing  Card  or  a Temporary Resident  Card Immigration Officials have not historically been asking  domestic travelers for registration documentation but in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and current atmosphere  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail as appropriate

Long Chris Subject	Wash POst Article- Part Three Traders Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires By Dan Morgan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday August 23 2001 Page A01 Last of three articles ATLANTA Ever since steamboat captain WP Lay founded Alabama Power Co in 1906 to develop electricity along the Coosa River utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose so southerners could have power and light Now a bunch of outsiders who buy and sell electricity but dont have a single retail customer below the Mason-Dixon line have their sights set on those wires and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration Aided by supercomputers and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nations power grid then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand they want to remove what they contend is a wire curtain around the South That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new federally supervised regional authority The monopoly is the wires and thats where the battles occur said Jeffrey K Skilling who was chief executive of Houstons Enron Corp the largest of the power merchants until he resigned last week The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation In 1992 with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid Congress opted for a competitive market The plan was to dismantle long-standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand Now these new merchants of power along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world have become strong advocates for a free-flowing national electricity market But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation they are running into resistance from traditional utilities exemplified by Atlantas Southern Co now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities At issue is how fast the federal government in the wake of the California electricity crisis should push for yet more changes Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC recently stocked with President Bushs pro-market appointees ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities Those authorities in turn will build new transmission lines do away with bottlenecks set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all Next month the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South according to executives at Southern Co whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia Alabama Mississippi and north Florida Southern Co Chairman H Allen Franklin said in a recent interview will not go blindly into the system proposed by FERC Although unfettered access to Southerns 26650 miles of lines might help long-distance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron company officials say it could mean congestion power outages and higher prices for their 39 million retail customers When California was restructured it was thought there would be massive savings Franklin said Well there havent been Building the Power Trade If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity a visit to Houston dispels them In the citys energy alley Enron Corp -- with annual sales of more than 100 billion last year double those of Texaco -- is finishing a new 40-floor office building adjacent to its 50-story tower Enrons competitors Dynegy Inc Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy are a few blocks away Duke Energy North American merchant arm of Charlotte-based Duke Power has settled in as well And Calpine Corp plans to take over 12 floors of a new 32-story building near Enron These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market which now handles about a quarter of US electricity output But it is still a work in progress fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market the 1992 Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas Many did Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast which had long endured high power costs To spur competition California and some northeastern states went further requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers Many states went further still ending their utilities long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity Enron formed in 1985 by the merger of two big gas-pipeline companies was quick to seize the opportunities Its chairman Kenneth Lay a former official at the Federal Power Commission FERCs precursor during the Nixon administration had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the 1980s As the electricity market began to develop in the early 1990s Lay and Skilling a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets Enron signed its first long-term power contract in 1989 Skilling recalls Independent companies that wanted to install gas-fired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under long-term contract -- then sell the electricity back to Enron We started creating forward and futures markets using a lot more financial engineering than was required in other commodity businesses Skilling said By the late 1990s Enron was buying the output of generating plants days weeks months and even years before it was produced using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold During the past five years Enron has been one of the nations fastest-growing companies Its net income rose 40 percent in the second quarter of this year although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its 2000 high of 90 mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity Investors pushed the price still lower after Skillings departure last week Southern Inhospitality Like other merchants Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition But the Southeast remained less-friendly territory Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation Florida goes so far as to ban out-of-state companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas The web of power lines tied to the utilities coal- nuclear- and gas-fired generating plants reaches across states via 500-kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles For Southern Co its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride In 1997 it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report Clustered around its borders are Entergy another huge holding company that serves Louisiana Arkansas and parts of Mississippi and Texas Florida Power  Light Carolina Power  Light Duke Power and the federal governments centralized power giant the Tennessee Valley Authority Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices Prices run 15 percent or more below the national average thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high-tension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels FERC in a series of orders from 1996 to 2000 required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time The message a former official said was they couldnt use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed plant-to-customer systems A November 2000 FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the regions utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region FERC investigators cited Southern Cos refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc connect to its transmission lines in Alabama Southern said the added load would cause an area-wide stability problem for electric supply In that case FERC denied SkyGens request for relief Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that day-ahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southerns territory have become possible But he said Enron has trouble getting long-term transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly Also he said Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southerns grid If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co to Jacksonville Electric thered be zero available Presto said Of the overall situation in the Southeast he said that the utilities give you 0 to 5 percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load retail customers So you have a huge highway thats supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isnt available to the wholesalers Southern Co Chairman Franklin dismissed as unfounded the complaints of the merchants and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Cos lines say they generally have been treated well Robert Johnston president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia MEAG which supplies power to 48 towns took issue with the notion of a wire curtain The market is growing in Georgia he said MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers It also has its own generators producing power at four sites though Southern Co has an interest in all of them Theres not a grass-roots interest driving the reforms Franklin said Its the wholesale players While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast though Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year Mirant Corp Southern Cos marketing subsidiary competed in California the Midwest and the North supplementing leaner profits from Southern Cos regulated units Southerns strategy has been clear Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home said Allen Mosher director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association Well Connected for Battle The next move is up to the federal government Next month Sen Jeff Bingaman D-NM chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission so that vested interests will not be able to manipulate the use of the transmission system to benefit their own plants Bingamans office said In the House key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin R-La whose state is home to Southern Cos western neighbor Entergy and Rep Joe Barton R-Tex chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee who has had close ties to the huge coal-dependent Texas utility TXU Last week Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L Hebert Jr a Mississippi protg of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott R-Miss to handle regulatory and government affairs Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K Armey R-Tex as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie  Associates Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay R-Tex the hometown Houston congressman though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay an enthusiast for electricity deregulation can bring to bear Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closed-door meetings that DeLay sponsored but did not attend could not reach consensus on electricity As a result the energy bill passed by the House on Aug 2 skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability Bushs election and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants Bushs first two appointees to FERC Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck Wood had worked with Enron during a six-year effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas where Wood headed the states public utility commission Brownell a former Pennsylvania utility regulator won praise from Enron in 1997 when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market On July 11 with a majority in tow Wood Brownell and William L Massey a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition tossed out proposals by Southern Co and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations or RTOs It was about time a bomb was dropped Wood said But FERCs action may only have been what power associations Mosher calls the beginning of a long movie Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high-voltage power lines western property-rights advocates and state utility regulators Politically well-connected groups not now regulated by FERC -- including the TVA rural electric co-ops and municipal power systems -- are also wary of new federal powers There are big questions about FERCs role who will determine transmission-line charges should there be federal authority to site power lines should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability said Rep Richard Burr R-NC vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners noted that her states three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines without our approval Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon Smith noted that 60 percent of the states power comes from hydroelectric dams Thats public property she said In Alabama James Sullivan a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Cos affiliate said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding Im opposed to any changes to our electric system in Alabama until I know its going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us he said In the view of Southern Co Chairman Franklin it is still an open question whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires Nonetheless the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to put the genie back in the bottle according to a former FERC official The power merchants readily concur Everybodys paying too much because youve got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities Enrons Presto said Staff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report  2001 The Washington Post Company

700 pm - Update Emergency20 09The situation continues to be stable  CLHB has reinitated LPG operation s to LaPaz but continue their inspection  TR will not reinitiate gas or c rude export operations until we have completed our inspection  We have for med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection  It could take as long as 48 hours but well have a better estimate after we  get a progress report in the morning   All crews available systemwide are  mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority co ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano  The three stations in the altipl ano have been shut down bled off and locked  Other supervisors throughou t the system have been advised and are on alert 09Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and  inspection action plan  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE t he regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute ene rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in spection  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L aPaz  Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide  only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shut-in 09We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received  inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system   We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to th e volatility of the issue in LaPaz  Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed w ith the message 09We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days   In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s afely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne cessary 09The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revol utionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action  Morales has had co ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so we re still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry o r if it is against government  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro w  Their agenda is national - theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past proba bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold  The po litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int erests looking to fill the leadership void  Were watching this situation  closely  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for  at least the next few days - once were comfortable with the operational si tuation well discuss a longer-term solution 09Steve20 09---------------------- Forwarded by Steve HopperTRANSREDES on 0717200 1 0637 PM ---------------------------20 09Steve Hopper20 07172001 0353 PM20 20 To     nicktombsshellcombr JohannesWalzebuckshellcombr Peter E W eidlerEnronEnronXGate20 cc     20 09Subject        Emergency20 20 09At 145 pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG li ne in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station  Our OSSA II crude ex ports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb  We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode  Th e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediat e threat neutralized 09However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 day s of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and  will notify the Enron Crisis team 09We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized  a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw ork  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go o ut in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply  Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the sit uation and so far am getting support  Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of a n organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be  helpful 09Additionally weve shut down all non-critical maintenance operations th roughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perf orm vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our  people complete the overall plan 09I will keep you posted as things develop20 09Steve20

To	sharris2enroncom Subject	Marlys Palumbo Dear Jim I have a good friend here in Seattle named Ralph Palumbo who is one of the attorneys with whom we prosecuted the antitrust case against Microsoft that we settled last year  His wife Marlys whom I also know well is a candidate for appointment as the administrator of Region 10 of the Environmental Protection Agency which encompasses Washington Oregon Idaho and Alaska  I know that you are busy as hell but I wanted to set out below some information about Marlys and about the status of her efforts to win this appointment and then ask whether Enron might be interested in supporting her candidacy by putting in a good word at the White House Marlys received her law degree from Seattle University in 1982  She then spent four years as a commercial litigation associate at Bogle  Gates in Seattle  From 1986-89 she was general counsel of Sabey Corporation a diversified real estate development holding company  From 1989-1997 she was vice president and general counsel of Philip Environmental Inc formerly Burlington Environmental which was a publicly traded 500 million waste management and environmental engineering and remediation company with operations in the US and Canada  In 1997 that company merged with two other public companies to form Philip Services Corporation  From the date of the merger through the present Marlys has been Senior VP Law of Philip Services Corp which is a 2 billion company that provides integrated industrial and metals recovery services to commercial and industrial customers in North America and Europe  For the last several years Marlys has worked out of the Philip Services corporate offices in Houston Marlys has in-depth expertise on environmental legal and scientific issues coupled with senior management experience in the business world  She would bring to the table a unique ability to effect a change of direction in EPA Region 10 because she has worked effectively with this Region and other Regions for two decades  Implementing White House policies in Region 10 will require the Administrator to work with a staff of long-term professional civil servants who themselves have extensive legal and scientific expertise  The Administrator must win their respect and must have the personal skills to manage a large organization and lead it in new directions  Marlys has the experience the skills and the personal qualities that would well-suit her to doing all of those things Her candidacy is being supported by former EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus by other former senior EPA and Justice Department officials and by business and industry leaders in the Northwest including CEOs or other senior executives of Boeing Weyerhaeuser PACCAR Puget Sound Energy Simpson InvestmentsSimpson Timber Co Plum Creek Timber Group Delta Airlines Burlington Northern Air Cargo Management Group FMC Corp Fluke Capital Management and Sabey Corp My understanding is that the appointment will be made based on recommendations from Republican Representatives and Senators from the four states encompassed by Region 10 and key people in both the EPA and the White House  Washington has no Republican Senators but Republican Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn has recommended Marlys to the White House I have known Marlys since shortly after moving to Seattle in 1995  She is an extremely bright charming and capable person and I have a lot of respect for her  If you think Enron would be willing to consider helping her candidacy I know that she would be eager to meet or talk with you or others at Enron and I can provide the names of the relevant contact people at EPA and the White House I am not asking that you do anything as a favor to me but only if it would serve Enrons interests to do so  Of course this issue may be completely outside the realm of those interests and if so I apologize for taking up your time  I hope all is well with you and Carrin and look forward to seeing both of you again soon Parker Parker C Folse III Susman Godfrey LLP 1201 Third Avenue Suite 3090 Seattle WA 98101 206 516-3880

time to Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan Indonesia Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Georgia and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled   In  addition  we recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank  Jordan  Lebanon  Saudi  Arabia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered     For  non-US  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation There  have  been  several recent reports of non-US citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation  when  boarding  US  domestic  flights  As  a result  we  suggest  that all non-US citizens who currently reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof  of their status as a precautionary measure  It appears that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the  age  of  18 to carry hisher registration documentation with  them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident Card  Form  I-94  card Employment Authorization Card Border Crossing  Card  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for   registration   documentation  but  in  light  of  the heightened  security measures and current atmosphere it would be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail as appropriate

Oregon  I would think about 6 months  After all that is NWNs attraction  Our goal should be to reach CLOSING in 9 months  Paul can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board  Thanks -----Original Message-----From 	Kaufman Paul Sent	Monday October 08 2001 638 PM To	Metts Mark Uhl Jessica Mordaunt Kristina Shapiro Richard Subject	update Three matters 1	Conference call with Staff Particpants were  Phil Nyegaard staff lead for the EnronPGE merger and currently acting chief of staff Bryan Conway lead staff electric techie and staff on the SierraPGE transaction Mark Helman Staff lead on PGEs rate case and the lead on the SierraPGE transaction Lee Sparling a lead on a number of gas company cases and Bonnie Tatum lead staff gas techie  The call went well  Staff was upbeat interested but of course non-commital  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling Timing  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker but this transaction presented different issues than past cases  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs electric practices Financing  Helman asked how NNG will finance the 155 billion cash portion of the purchse   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFBMerrill financing Other Regulatory Review  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt intrastate  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review but that we expected the issues to be limited Process  Nyegaard noted that Mark D and Peggy F had met with the Commissioners  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission after our application is filed  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners   We said that we werent planning any addition private meetings 2	Other parties Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for todays article  He questioned NNGs ability to finance the purchase of a larger company  In his private discussion with Sue Jenks repeated his concern with NNGs ability to finance the transaction  The only other concern he raised was NNGs practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively 3	Rate Conditions Were still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNGs ROE earnings test   Under this approach PGE would  1 compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings 2 create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized 3 share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history  Fuel savings resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNGs PGA and through PGEs PCA of its progeny PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG 4	FERC Review Were pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRAs market power analysis  A revised schedule for the FERC SEC OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week --end--

Trimester I and were headed into Trimester II As Im sure youve already noticed the material is getting more and more challenging You should also be aware that I will be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses The Unit 4 Test is a good example of the thinking skills that Id like to see The multiple choice questions were quite challenging and required that you apply what wed learned Although the class average was 73 on this test and many of you scored lower than you normally do I think that we have to give ourselves credit for passing such a challenging test The best news is that your portfolio grades will more than make up for a lower test score One might say that I even planned it that way - Now we have to get ready for the next test It will be a similar test in style and difficulty and we wont be doing a portfolio So you should take the Unit 4 Test and study the type of questions that you missed Dont worryI know you can handle this By the end of the year you will be a superb test taker and algebraist PS Dont forget to discuss your Unit 4 Test score with your parents They had to take challenging tests in their day - and they can help you prepare for the types of questions even if theyve forgotten some of the math Mrs Ward

700 pm - Update Emergency20 09The situation continues to be stable  CLHB has reinitated LPG operation s to LaPaz but continue their inspection  TR will not reinitiate gas or c rude export operations until we have completed our inspection  We have for med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection  It could take as long as 48 hours but well have a better estimate after we  get a progress report in the morning   All crews available systemwide are  mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority co ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano  The three stations in the altipl ano have been shut down bled off and locked  Other supervisors throughou t the system have been advised and are on alert 09Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and  inspection action plan  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE t he regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute ene rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz s electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in spection  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L aPaz  Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide  only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shut-in 09We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received  inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia ns this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system   We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to th e volatility of the issue in LaPaz  Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed w ith the message 09We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days   In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s afely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne cessary 09The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revol utionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action  Morales has had co ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so we re still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry o r if it is against government  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro w  Their agenda is national - theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past proba bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold  The po litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int erests looking to fill the leadership void  Were watching this situation  closely  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for  at least the next few days -

the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply  Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the sit uation and so far am getting support  Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of a n organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be  helpful 09Additionally weve shut down all non-critical maintenance operations th roughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perf orm vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our  people complete the overall plan 09I will keep you posted as things develop20 09Steve20

endeavoring to  increase  your sense of security while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp  Security  resides  in  our business

report security threats We  have two areas to update you on  changes in the access procedures for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel advisory Access to the Enron Center Over  the  next few days the following access control procedures will be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  and  other  facilities  where practical    As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer   Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center US drivers  license  US  or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identification    Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must completely  fill out the visitor card  Adult visitors without a  valid  photo  ID  US  drivers  license US or foreign passport  or  some  form  of  US  federal  state  or local identification  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron Center    Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times    Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron  employee  or badged contractor signed into a visitors log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged contractor   and  escorted  to  their  appointment   At  the conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor the visitor badge  collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged contractor    Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines report suspicious  activity  to  Security phone 3-6300 do not open secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors open allowing tail gating by others These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted  at  Enron   We  ask  that all employees be patient during congested  times  in  the  lobby   As we proceed and obtain increased guard   personnel  and  equipment  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to decrease   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees Travel Advisory Update With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes  we have two important recommendations    While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be avoided   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel during  this  time to Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan Indonesia Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Georgia and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled   In  addition  we recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank  Jordan  Lebanon  Saudi  Arabia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered     For  non-US  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation There  have  been  several recent reports of non-US citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation  when  boarding  US  domestic  flights  As  a result  we  suggest  that all non-US citizens who currently reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof  of their status as a precautionary measure  It appears that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the  age  of  18 to carry hisher registration documentation with  them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident Card  Form  I-94  card Employment Authorization Card Border Crossing  Card  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for   registration   documentation  but  in  light  of  the heightened  security measures and current atmosphere it would be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail as appropriate
