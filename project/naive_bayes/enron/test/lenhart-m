Blanchard As we all know Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU  While livin g in Power dorm Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that h e was hanging out with say Hey Dude Sorority girls are hot  Blanchard being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a master of  the English language though that this fresh Pi Phi meant All greek girl s are good in bed  So what did Blanchard do  He went out and found the f irst GREEK girl he could and he started dating her  After many pleasant y ears some of which I will not mention for Tims sake and mine  Tim and  his Greek Goddess are engaged  Yes thats right  Tim took Lenharts advi ce because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with the opposite sex I mean who wouldnt take his advice and Tim decided to start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who al l give it up like it was going out o f style 20 20 Tims wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME  For those of yo u who are not Tiger fans which seems to be most of you these days that i s Oct 20th  I know it is an away game which is better than having a wed ding on a home game  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of  town games  True story here  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mot her on Friday night  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedd ing one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot s peak the language  Anyway after the wedding that we attended Louises mo m asked me if I would prefer Tims wedding ceremony be in either half Engli sh and half Greek or all in Greek  I responded I do not care  I will be listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway  I know what some of y ou are saying it is only one game  Yes and I am sure that was the only w eekend they could hav e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been  to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center because all of us from New Orlea ns have been to numerous weddings  goat roasts there  Anyway it is a don e deal and we are all happy for the couple 20 The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tims bachelor party  We have it planned for the weekend of September 22 what a novel idea  Plan a w edding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event nor Jazz Fes t  We are planning to go to Vegas  As per our current plans we would  leave on that Thursday the 20th I think and return on Sunday  Paw Paw Blanchard heard that in September his game of choice really starts hittin g that of course would be the nickel slots  Paw Paw already has his Pan ama Jack hat his         Geaux Dinar-deaux T-shirt his jams and his bl ack socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready  His fanny pack is s tuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes  He is really fired up about the 1 99 shrimp cocktail early bird special of course The plans are to get there Thursday night Nicky get more drink tickets  Thursday night we can get settled possibly gamble a bit  On Friday mayb e play golf although I will probably be too drunk  hung over  missing fo r an early tee time  On Friday night we can go clubbin as I am sure  The Tricky Texas Trio Lenhart Landry and Mitch will want to do  On Sat urday Tim wants to wake up early get the sports section of the Advocate  drink coffee and bitch about the Tigers  Instead we are going to watch a nd bet on College Football all day Saturday night Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy  However we are not  doing that  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers he can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team  Instea d either SaturDay or Friday night myself and a select group yet to be de termined but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin im pression at Club C2K will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu  Therefore  on Saturday night we will have entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before and who know what is expected of them that way Lenhart  will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway bl ow-up doll  Remember Tim  If you use a strap on it is not considered ch eating  I am a future lawyer  I should know This weekend is September 22  There is no excuse for you to come up with w hen you have this much notice  Out of money  Bullshit  Save up until the n  Have to work  Bullshit  Take a vacation day  Actually September wil l be the first month that I will be gainfully employed  But I know that m y boss the Honorable GThomas Porteous will let me off for one day if deb auchery will be had although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout the weekend For those of you who will be recently married I already have an excuse for you  Honey Tim came to all OUR wedding functions  The least I can do i s return the favor For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim I also have an exc use Baby  Schmoopy  I wish your tits were as big as Mindy if want oth er people to come to our wedding functions then I have to attend theirs  For all of you single guys no excuse Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience or I will see y all this weekend

to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand Based on its announcements Thursday however it still has a heck of a long way to go With Enrons restatement Thursday of nearly five years worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago But were not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and thats because the companys explanations of all this continue to be dense confusing and next to impossible to grasp Try this tidbit from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission In addition Enrons net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock which eliminate upon consolidation This in effect reduces Enrons share of JEDIs earnings Huh And no it doesnt help you to know that Chewco is an entity that wasnt included in Enrons financial results but which Enron now admits should have been Or that JEDI isnt a Star Wars reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested Its still impenetrable Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesnt give enough information The company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as  unconsolidated Uh - okay WHY didnt it meet the criteria and why did Enron previously believe that it did Enron doesnt say Finally Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed Hmmm Beyond the fact that Enron doesnt elaborate on the nature of these audit adjustments and reclassifications or why they were originally considered immaterial consider that according to Enrons own figures in the 8-K they add up to a negative earnings impact of 87 million since 1997 That amount doesnt sound like any definition of immaterial Ive ever heard An Enron spokesman couldnt immediately be reached for comment In fairness this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enrons Byzantine structure which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction and  you get the idea Its next to impossible to make clear because Enrons structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place The market is plenty puzzled by all this even in the wake of Enrons attempt to clarify things Take a look at the companys drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday After news of the restatements hit Enron stock first jumped higher going as high as 10 a share then soon dropped back to as low as 840 as investors started to digest the details of the news Then up again to about 925 then down again to its current level of around 850 Theres no reason investors should be confused like this There is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance should be unable to understand the regulatory filings structure earnings and balance sheet of any public company If thats happens its the companys fault not the investors -either because the company hasnt explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with If Enron wants to get back the markets confidence fixing that problem one way or the other would be a good place to start -By Michael Rapoport Dow Jones Newswires 201-938-5976 michaelrapoportdowjonescom Folder Name Dynegy Inc Relevance Score on Scale of 100 100 To review or revise your folder visit httpwwwdjinteractivecom or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at customnewsbisdowjonescom or by phone at 800-369-7466 Outside the US and Canada call 609-452-1511 or contact your local sales representative Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Pretenders vs Contenders Well Well Well I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like Overrated Overrated I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody wont get barraged with weak Reply Alls from recipients who think they can go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack ie Val and his weak shit he likes to send This time is different because I think yall should know who your fellow pathetic smack talking LSU fans are Yall can start a new support group - called Vassighs College Football Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms Cedric Benson and Roy Williams et al Yall have dished it all out so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajuns included in this e-mail header Simms sucks how could he be a preseason heisman candidate - Over his last three games Simms is 59-of-88 670 percent for 698 yards and 12 touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception 17641 rating  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of games recently and is coming into his own  Simms will be a top NFL pick as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson  I cant think of any College Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has with Simms Benson and Williams The SEC is the best conference in football the Big XII Sucks - What a joke that statement is LSU would whip UT  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice UT is the most overrated team in college football - interesting since they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason polls Mack Brown can only recruit - he cant coach worth a damn - Nick Saban is better - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasnt lost in Austin since he has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red Stick - just THIS SEASON Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the Big XII The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable Two of the top ranked BIG XII teams only losses were to the other top ranked BIG XII school  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play against each other The highest ranked SEC team Florida lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic Arkansas All football players worth a damn have left yalls God Forsaken state Peyton to Tennessee Marshall Faulk to SDSU the newest Manning to Ole Miss that just whipped up on yalls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick on national television on a cool October Saturday night Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play college ball though - thats some encouraging news for yall I cant think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State football player David Lafleur Kevin Faulk Harvey Williams Eddie Kennison - the list goes on and on  It is really pathetic Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky Tony Brackens Dan Neil Shaun Rogers Leonard Davis Priest Holmes Blake Brockermeyer Bryant Westbrook and many others  Look at Eric Metcalf in his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records Texas players are magic baby Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose Tom Landry Bobby Layne and Tommy Nobis I hope yall enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while yall attend Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of OU and some other help - watch UT vs Miami in the Rose Bowl I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems pretty foolish to you now doesnt it That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL  He might have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket  The difference between how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night showed LSUs deficiency at the QB position  Fumbling bumbling stumbling is the best way to describe his play CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store because you need to save your money to pay on the 500 bet you made with me the night of Vals wedding in that little bar in Natchez Mississippi  You boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night since all you were ranting was tiger bait tiger bait any time I was trying to tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have already done this season The bet for 500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher at the end of the 2001 College Football season Me  University of Texas You   LSU Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash - or we can work out an installment plan Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Vals amigos I forgot the name but know the face It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of Texas always being superior in every facet over its little cajun neighbor to the east - Lousyanna Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys the 3 time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader of the free world The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreauxs balls for the next 15 years or so And the bottom line is that yall are in my State working because there are no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of yalls only professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players -

wedding with Louise and her mother on Friday night You have not   lived until you take two dates to a wedding one of whom is engaged to   your good friend and the other whom cannot speak the language   Anyway after the wedding that we attended Louises mom asked me if I   would prefer Tims wedding ceremony be in either half English and half   Greek or all in Greek I responded I do not care I will be   listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway I know what some   of you are saying it is only one game Yes and I am sure that was   the only weekend they could hav e it since so many of us from New   Orleans have been to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center because   all of us from New Orleans have been to numerous weddings  goat   roasts there Anyway it is a done deal and we are all happy for the   couple     The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tims bachelor party We   have it planned for the weekend of September 22 what a novel idea   Plan a wedding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event   nor Jazz Fest We are planning to go to Vegas As per our current   plans we would leave on that Thursday the 20th I think and return   on Sunday Paw Paw Blanchard heard that in September his game of   choice really starts hitting that of course would be the nickel   slots Paw Paw already has his Panama Jack hat his Geaux   Dinar-deaux T-shirt his jams and his black socks with brown leather   sandals packed and ready His fanny pack is stuffed with Twinkies and   silver dimes He is really fired up about the 199 shrimp cocktail   early bird special of course   The plans are to get there Thursday night Nicky get more drink   tickets Thursday night we can get settled possibly gamble a bit   On Friday maybe play golf although I will probably be too drunk    hung over  missing for an early tee time On Friday night we can   go clubbin as I am sure The Tricky Texas Trio Lenhart Landry   and Mitch will want to do On Saturday Tim wants to wake up early   get the sports section of the Advocate drink coffee and bitch about   the Tigers Instead we are going to watch and bet on College   Football all day   Saturday night Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy However we are   not doing that If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers he   can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading   team Instead either SaturDay or Friday night myself and a select   group yet to be determined but including Lenhart if he is not doing   his best Ricky Martin impression at Club C2K will go on a recon   mission to the Deja Vu Therefore on Saturday night we will have   entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before and who   know what is expected of them that way Lenhart will not make the   entertainment cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway blow-up doll   Remember Tim If you use a strap on it is not considered cheating   I am a future lawyer I should know   This weekend is September 22 There is no excuse for you to come up   with when you have this much notice Out of money Bullshit Save   up until then Have to work Bullshit Take a vacation day   Actually September will be the first month that I will be gainfully   employed But I know that my boss the Honorable GThomas Porteous   will let me off for one day if debauchery will be had although I may   have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout   the weekend   For those of you who will be recently married I already have an   excuse for you Honey Tim came to all OUR wedding functions The   least I can do is return the favor   For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim I also have   an excuse Baby  Schmoopy  I wish your tits were as big as Mindy   if want other people to come to our wedding functions then I have to   attend theirs For all of you single guys no excuse   Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience or I will   see yall this weekend All plans are subject to change Chad if   you want

A 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch wide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys 2  San Francisco - A 49-year-old stockbroker who totally zoned when he ran according to his wife jogged off a 100-foot high cliff on his daily run 3  Buston NC - a man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it  Beachgoers said Daniel Jones 21 dug the hole for fun or for protection from the wind and had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom when it collapsed burying him beneath 5 feet of sand   People used their hands and shovels trying to claw their way to Jones a resident of Woodbridge VA but could not reach him  It took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked on  Jones was pronounced dead at the hospital 4  Lompoc CA - Santiago Alvarado 24 was killed as he fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing  Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth rammed into the base of his skull as he hit the floor 5  Dahlonega GA - ROTC cadet Nick Berrena 20 was stabbed to death by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman 23 who was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the flack vest Berrena was wearing 6  Selbyville DE - Sylvester Briddell Jr 26 was killed as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger 7  Windsor Ontario - Daniel Kolta 27 and Randy Taylor 33 died in a head-on collision thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles 8  Taos NM - A woman went to a poison control center after eating three birth-control vaginal inserts  Marie Valishnokov who spoke little English thought the inserts were candy or gum being unable to read the foil wrappers After the third one she realized something was wrong with her throat and her mouth began to fill with a sour-tasting foam  She ran for the Poison Control Center where doctors were able to flush the foam from her mouth throat and stomach with no ill effects 9  La Grange GA - Attorney Antonio Mendoza was released from a trauma center after having a cell phone removed from his rectum  My dog drags the thing all over the house he said later  He must have dragged it into the shower  I slipped on the tile tripped against the dog and sat down right on the thing The extraction took more than three hours because the cover to Mendozas phone had opened during insertion  He was a real trooper during the entire episode said Dr Dennis Crobe Tony just cracked jokes and really seemed to be enjoying himself  Three times during the extraction his phone rang and each time he made jokes about it that just had us rolling on the floor  By the time we finished we really did expect to find an answering machine in there 10 Bremerton WA - Christopher Coulter and his wife Emily were engaging in bondage games when Christopher suggested spreading peanut butter on his genitals and letting Rudy their Irish Setter lick them clean Sadly Rudy lost control and began tearing at Christophers penis and testicles Rudy refused to obey commands and a panicked Emily threw a bottle of perfume at the dog  The bottle broke covering the dog and Christopher with perfume Rudy leaped back tearing away the penis While trying to get her unconscious husband in the car to take him to the hospital Emily fell twice injuring her wrists and ankle Christophers penis was put in a Styrofoam ice cooler  Chris is just plain lucky said the surgeon who spent eight hours reattaching the penis  Believe it or not the perfume turned out to be very fortuitous  The high alcohol content which must have been excruciatingly painful helped sterilize the wound  Also aside from it being removed the damage caused by the dogs teeth to the penis per se is minimal  Its really a very stringy piece of flesh  Mr Coulter stands an excellent chance of regaining the use of that limb Washington Animal Control has no plans to seize Rudy AND THE WINNER Paderborn Germany - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let fly and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich 46 was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dumptruck full of mud  The sheer force of the elephants unexpected defecation knocked Mr Riesfeldt to the ground where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him Jim Gruss Executive Director -

 i don t know if i can speak for everyone but i sure have missed it    it is ju st good to read all the smart witty humor again  i especially thought the part about screaming who let the dogs out was quite funny  it makes it  especially funny bc the employees play along instead of yelling out shut  up nerd   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together  it was real tough to see him go bc we are pretty close but not as close as mazi arz and i evidently are  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming  i decid ed to vacum behind the couch bc i had never cleand back there  when i loo ked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails    at f irst i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails p ossibly get here  but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails  i should have figured that he  didnt dispose of them properly  it is good to see that chad has figured o ut how to use the email system again  last week enron sent out a company w ide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company  i felt prett y embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply but went he replied to the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot  now  he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wid e email  well i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union  i know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip c lubs 20 MFL

allisonkellytlcvisioncom mailtoallisonkellytlcvisioncom Subject Racist photos of fraternity members rocks Auburn brings condemnation By DREW JUBERA  mailtodjuberaajccom mailtodjuberaajccom  Atlanta Journal-Constitution Staff Writer Auburn Ala -- When the Southern Poverty Law Center received a call this week about Internet photos of an Auburn University fraternity member dressed as a rifle-toting Klansman pretending to lynch a white student in blackface the staff checked out the photos date We wanted to verify that it was taken in 2001 not 1951 said Kelvin Datcher of the center in Montgomery that tracks incidents of bigotry The kids who called us were frantic The photo and others of students in blackface wearing Afros jewelry and jerseys with the lettering of a black fraternity were taken this year at Halloween parties at two fraternity houses and posted on the Internet by a party-photo service The incident has rocked the campus of more than 22000 students which bills itself as the loveliest village on the plain and says it is intent on recruiting minorities As the photos illustrate a racist segregated past is hard to escape Students at Auburn and other colleges have no personal memory of Jim Crow segregation But when it comes to socializing many students gravitate toward those of their own race And social fraternities and sororities --many of which used to enforce racial exclusionary clauses -- remain some of the last bastions of segregationist attitudes Last year when a black freshman applied to the University of Georgias all-white Alpha Gamma Delta most of the members were adamant that she be rejected If we had a black girl in our sorority none of the fraternities would want to do anything with us one was quoted as saying That incident came to light because one sorority member Ali Davis filed a racial discrimination complaint UGA temporarily suspended Alpha Gamma Delta during an investigation Davis saying she felt ostracized later left the school Around the country the Kappa Alpha Order which is fond of displaying the Confederate battle flag has been implicated in various racial incidents in recent years the Southern Poverty Law Center reported The Louisiana Tech University chapter was placed on probation after a confrontation with black football players in which frat members made racist remarks the center said At Millsaps College in Mississippi Kappa Alphas dressed in Afro wigs and blackface to protest pro-minority initiatives In February the KA chapter at the University of North Texas received a five-year suspension for disorderly conduct and verbal intimidation after some members were accused of racist remarks Such antics arent limited to Kappa Alpha or the South the Southern Poverty Law Center said Several fraternities and sororities at New Hampshires Dartmouth College threw a ghetto party in which students dressed up as urban African-Americans -- a theme that has surfaced at other campuses --while a sorority there promoted a slave auction fund-raiser The Sigma Chi fraternity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln burned a cross at one of its ceremonies Such incidents leave college administrators especially those assigned to foster diversity wringing their hands Weve been working so hard to do the right thing and then something like this happens Doyle Bickers Auburns director of admissions said Wednesday of the warped Halloween humor It breaks your heart You cant escape your history added Jim Hardin an adviser in the student life center When something like this comes up the question is Have you really changed or are you just putting on a good front  What has changed at Auburn according to many black students who make up 72 percent of the student body is the administrations swift and open reaction Interim President William F Walker immediately condemned the costumes as shocking and outrageous and suspended the fraternities Beta Theta Pi and Delta Sigma Phi He attended a meeting of the Black Student Union and promised a thorough but swift investigation which is expected to be completed within 10 days Stories on the incident were displayed on the universitys Web site Delta Sigma Phi has expelled the two members who dressed as a Klansman and his lynching victim and suspended four others Similar things have happened before said Roland Harris a junior management information systems major and member of Phi Beta Sigma one of four historically black fraternities on campus But this time a lot of people saw it and they have to do something Auburn admitted its first black student surrounded by 100 Alabama state troopers in 1961 The first black man pledged a traditionally white fraternity in 1984 and there currently is one black pledge among those 24 fraternities Auburns overall black population is still less than at most Southeastern Conference universities but stepped-up recruiting efforts led to a 24 percent increase of African-Americans admitted to this years freshman class One sign of changing times The universitys Student Government Association president is an African-American We were finally beginning to say Thank God were making some headway and here comes this sad unfortunate damaging incident said John Bello-Ogunu head of the universitys office of multicultural affairs It will no doubt be detrimental to our efforts to attract not only minority students but faculty and other staff as well Bello-Ogunu said the administrations reaction has been on the mark He added that more action is needed including diversity training for fraternities At the invitation of university officials and students the Southern Poverty Law Center will conduct a mass workshop on tolerance on Wednesday Prentice Gilbert an Auburn senior who oversees the campus historically black fraternities and who has helped recruit black students said it will take time to remedy the Halloween incidents impact I have to keep reminding myself these were the actions of a few individuals who do not represent Auburn as a whole Gilbert said This is the most devastating blow we could take The bottom line is do we really want to be the Auburn family he added If so we really could become the loveliest village on the plain as our motto says Ned Hansen Senior Recruiter - Medical Marketing LucasGroup Recruiting Excellence Since 1970 3384 Peachtree Rd Ste 700 Atlanta GA 30326 404-239-5630 Ext

Subject	Fwd a day in the life this is an old one but a great one If you dont like this email then you just dont understand A chronology of events for Saturday  December 4 1999 and the early morning hours of Sunday December 5 1999 600 Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 620 Get in car drive to New Braunfels 730 Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning 850 Turn 9 crack open first beer 853 Crack open second beer 858 Crack openyou get the idea 1030 Finish 18 holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 1035 Headed for San Antonio 1050 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 1110 We decide we dont have enough booze so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol 750 ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam 1150 Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About 70 degrees 1155 I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 1156 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself 1215 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT 1225 In the post-serenade serendipity 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 100 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 130 I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and 11 cans of beer into my pants 147 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as Cell-Phone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those non-refundable non-transferrable sons-of-bitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix non-refundable and non-transferrable Price 712 He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pre-game kingdom 234 Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy 245 I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas 301 The first quarter mercifully ends 9 yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler 336 Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety 356 Halftime score Nebraska 15 Texas 0 I wish I had another Traveler 411 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused 421 I buy my 2nd and 3rd 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase 5 Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies 451 No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more 5 beers from the Alamodome merchants 518 Score is Nebraska 22 Texas 0 I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field 527 I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable 537 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system 549 Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty 616 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship 630 Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the 800 Texas-Arizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care 712 We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig 717 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care 801 We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truck-mate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon 830 We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly 847 I am rallying I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona 911 Halftime score Texas 31 Arizona 29 I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me 941 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light 952 I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing 1009 Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off 1015 After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously 1022 I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops 1043 Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving 1059 With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap 1117 I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1131 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic

beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon 1211 We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle 1226 We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight 1259 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers 117 The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost 5 years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder 144 We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers 215 Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is 160 We give him 10 and tell him to keep it 217 There is a 20 minute wait We give the hostess 50 We are seated immediately 225 We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings 239 The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is 112 with tip 246 Im sleepy 912 I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty
