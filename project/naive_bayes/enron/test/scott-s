weekend  thanks for the input about clint- youre right and i hadnt realized that i fit his type until he defined it   now i know why hes so nice to me  he does know about brendan of course but since i dont always behave like i have a boyfriend its easy for guys to not take him too seriouslynot good  im also embarrassed that i flapped away in the car on saturday night- hope you dont think horrible things about me  although its okay if you do- i think horrible things about myself every now and then but i always attribute it to the lessons of lifeim curious about your work situations- youve never mentioned them  that is truly uncomfortable and i have not had to deal with that here keep me posted on your exciting life  otherwise im doing the right thing to not contact eric right  so silly for me to ask but i like being friends with him probably the flirting is fun but its a dead end At 0400 PM 4182001 -0500 you wrote I think theres probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory  The retaliationnumbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting  My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representative of Teds sex like dirt  Fortunately my behavior was very short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing  I wouldnt worry about the lecturingit happens when one has a bit to drink that or just utter flapping as in my case Thanks for the compliments but I find its easy to be around all of your friendsthat whole like attracts like thing  As for the email from Clint hes a cutie  Speaking from experience Id watch myself if I were you thoughthe flirtation is fun and harmless at this point but I get the impression that youre just Clints type and unless you have reciprocal interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious However if theres part of you that is curious like I said I think hes a great guy  Okay enough of my lecturing Ive just been caught in couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and Im forced to tell them I just dont feel the same waysomething thats hard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did occur Well Im off to Vegas this weekend  My guess is I wont be getting much sleep  Oh well life is tough Susan Embedded     Enron Capital  Trade Resources Corp image moved to file      From  Julie Gibson

my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart broken per Someone Like You and therefore must act like a slut to ignore the pain  Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at the padres gamei am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on saturday  at first he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i do care about him on some level but as i drank more i LECTURE more until he finally started walking away from me  how embarrassing  i am totally embarrassed that i wouldnt shut up  even more surprised that eric sent me the email on monday  i didnt see it until tuesday since i didnt work monday but am bummed because i called him monday evening to get eric angs phone numbersilly concern but he probably thinks i was calling just to get in touch with him  now  i will totally not make contact with him- not even respond to his emaildont need to overinflate peoples egos i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so months i love that you have so much fun here and everyone always comments on how cool you are and how easy you are to be aroundeveryone would be thrilled to have you back me especially  ill watch for good fares too

cc09Dan Watkiss dwatkissbracepattcom20 Subject09Entities that do not need power marketing authorization Christi-This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni cipalities and qualifying facilities QFs must obtain power marketing au thorization  The answer is no With regard to state agencies or municipalities section 201f of the Fede ral Power Act FPA states that no provision of Part II of the FPA which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce shall apply to or be deemed to include the United States a S tate or any political subdivision of a state or any agency authority or  instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing or any corporation whi ch is wholly owned directly or indirectly by any one or more of the foreg oing or any officer agent employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc h in the course of his official duty unless such provision makes specific  reference thereto Section 205 of the FPA which would would otherwise require an entity to ha ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC does not apply to  state agencies and municipalities With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization most QFs are exempt some small power production facilities are not exempt from most p rovisions of the FPA including section 205 which requires public utilitie s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file rate schedules with FERC  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA which au thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchasers avoided co st  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC  but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF status is lost Let me know if you need anything else Andrea M Settanni Bracewell

that you have been down in utah sounds great of course you could stay with me on the friday night that would be perfect must tell you though that there is a bit of change in plans sam and ali in order to make the trip somewhat cheaper have also invited a couple of guys that they know to stay with us as well im fine with it because i say the more the merrier but it could be kind of crowded of course the guys will be on the floor with their sleeping bags and the girls will have the beds but still i guess this would have to be something you are comfortable with i really dont think wed have to even hang out with the guys much we could and i plan on totally doing my own thing ali and sam are both really cool they are partiers and very fun but also sweet and very smart ali graduated from washington state with a degree in art studies i think and studied abroad in denmark for a year sam is a school teacher english junior high aged kids and went to college somewhere in california where they are both from they are cool and i think you would get along great with them and they with you of course it would be great if you could coincide your trip with another one to have a few interviews up here  hope you can find a cheap flight and let me know how the job search is going take care bonnie ps i did hear about the suicide of one of the top execs so incredibly sad what a messy business i saw ken lays wife interviewed she maintains her husband is ENTIRELY innocent and had nothing to do with the fall etc what do you make of that it was very interesting oh my date with the memphis guy was good very interesting he was really cute and we kissed at the end of the night it was fun he was funny would definitely go out with him again if he asked but we are also pretty different people

read my mindi was actually thinking about you and seattle and how i need to get myself up there  im using this email bc im actually in Utah right now visiting my friend monique and for some reason this computer wont let me send things from my other address  anyway i flew in today and will be here through tuesday at least  its absolutely beautiful right now im hanging at the internet cafe until monique gets off work and then were going to grab some food and maybe go out for a bitsupposedly its Australia Day here i think its an informal holiday so you know tonight will be fun w all the aussies around here painting the town red the whistler trip sounds awesome  i will definitely do some research and see what kind of fares i can find to get myself up there  a huge part of me is still feeling this intense draw to move to the emerald city  hopefully something will pan out that allows that to happen  we shall see  this last week at work was so tryingjust making the decisions i had to etc  but everyone there has been really cool about it and has offered to help in any way they can  most of the older married people are encouraging me to just enjoy myself and have an adventure im not sure if you heard the latest news from enron but one of our former execs he resignedretired in May committed suicide  its very sad and just reconfirms to me that this chapter of my life needs to be closed and that i need to head on to bigger and better things  its been entirely too taxing to deal w all the emotions than accompany this type of thingand somehow still being a part of the reformed trading organization would only seem to keep those wounds open for me ok enough morbid stuff  hope all is well with you  if i remember correctly you are supposed to be on your date tonight with the west point guy  cant wait to here how that went  i will get back to you ASAP about whistleras soon as ive had a chance to look at airfares and my options do you think itd be possible to stay with you friday night if i did end up coming  that way we could head out bright and early saturday morning fortunately im going to get some skiing in up here or down here in relation to youits been about 3 yrs since the last time i skied should prove interesting the first run  but it may start the ski bug which just wont allow me to pass up another chance to hit the slopes talk to you soon susan MSN Photos

with Nilay  I can swing by later if youd like me to explain in a little more detail Susan -----Original Message-----From 	Baumbach David Sent	Monday April 30 2001 912 AM To	Scott Susan M

transpired since my last ever-po pular Friday State of the Union  As usual my friends and I have been up to no good and fortunately for you I am ready and willing to tell you all a bout it There are so many people and things to talk about and only one Sta te of the Union to cover it all  This could be a very rough ride so as al ways Brace Yourself Multiple choice question  Which one of the these airport names does not be long A Reagan International Airport  B Bush Intercontinental Airport C  JFK Airport D Louis Armstrong National Airport  Well in case you are stum ped here is a little hint think Satchmo  Chris Coulon my political in sider told me that the city of New Orleans had narrowed it down to two cho ices Edwin Edwards National Airport or Louis Armstrong National Airport   Well it was a close race but considering Edwin Edwards was convicted last y ear of numerous counts of bribery and extortion the City of New Orleans de cided on Louis Armstrong  So now every time you fly into Satchmo make su re you high-five a friend as you pass that beautiful picture of Chris Owens and her 60-year old breasts because you are now in New Orleans a place wh ere absolutely nothing gets taken serious Speaking of New Orleans has anyone read the book Confederacy of Dunces  N ow that he lives in the French Quarter Granola Centola truly personifies t he books main character Ignatius Reilly  Just last weekend while walkin g back to his apartment from Cats Meow Larry felt the need to relieve him self next to a neighbors carwhat a way to build neighborhood friendships   While in mid-stream Larry got picked up by a policeman and dragged o ff to the Orleans Parish Prison OPP for indecent exposure and public drun kenness  When I asked Larry what it was like to spend the night in the Bl ack Bar Hotel his response was It wasnt that bad I talked politics the  whole night with my cell-mates and he added the best thing was that the y cell-mates were all Democrats  Can you believe it  Yes Larry we ca n believe that all your cell-mates were Democrats20 Well if you havent already heard Shawn The Wop has moved back into Beau  Chene College Apartments  This move has made Shawn a target for jokes amon gst most of our friends  Thankfully Shawn takes these comments with a gra in of salt and even recently commented to me that I Shawn love living in Beau Chene especially since I have been included in Jeff Jordans Landlo rds Monday Night Football parties  Shawn says there is only two require ments to get into this party 1 you must be a guy and 2 you must BYOC  Bring Your Own Cold Cuts  Shawn says that no one seems to like his ham o r turkey and that for some reason there tends to be an enormous amount of S alami at these parties  Shawn says it never fails whenever Jeff introduce s him as an old FIJI  to someone at the party the first question is always Do you know Nick Nesbit and the Turner Twins and the second question is Do you like Salami  Word to the wise Shawn you might want to rethink  the meaning of the C part  in BYOC While most of Houston wants the 2012 Summer Olympics in Houston so they can watch the events the girl I went on a date with a few weeks ago wants it  to come here so she can compete in the Track and Field Events  Now I am no t insecure about my manliness nor do I consider myself out of shape but a fter having dinner with the she hulk I felt pretty damn wimpy  Thankfull y I had my good buddy Lenhart to pick me up from my deep depression  We w ent out the following Thursday night to Houstons Latest Hot Spot TACO MIL AGRO  Since Matt had  a very bad case of Laryngitis we worked as a team  I talked to all of the girls and Matt just stood there and smiled  Oddly e nough we got a ton of girls phone numbers  Matt couldnt understand it a nd even boasted about it the next day I Matt was on fire last night  I didnt even say one word the whole night and for some reason I got more ph one numbers than ever before  Overhearing our conversation Tim Paw-Paw Blanchard chimed in It is not a coincidence dude Speaking of Paw-Paw next Friday Night is Tims Bachelor Party in Baton Rou ge  As most of you already know Tim does not have a spontaneous bone

Robert FrankNAEnronEnron Janet R DietrichHOUEESEES Harry KingerskiNAEnronEnron cc Subject	WEST DESKS--FERC authorizes power marketers to purchase from industrials and more On March 14 01 FERC issued an Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West  Docket No EL01-47 Most significantly FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers like EPMI and EES effective 31401 through 123101  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials  This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that request by mid-May In addition FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates Specifics Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for back-up for self-generation who will be public utilities subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated entities like EPMI or EES without prior notice under section 205 of FPA would usually require 60 day advance notice filing -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial however the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases  Our report must show the names of the industrial aggregate amount of capacity andor energy purchased from each seller and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller  Accountingcommercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility  This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases only can sell what it generates unless otherwise allowed or not precluded by its retail tariff -- must file a rate schedule at FERC for this but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and authorizations -- This authorization expires after 123101 Effective 31401 through 123101 retail customers in WSCC as permitted by state laws and regulations and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at market-based rates  These transactions can occur in several ways  An aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load under retail choice programs  In addition wholesale and retail load with contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of power is greater than the value of consumption  Similar quarterly reports would be due by EPMIEES NOTE  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with transmission provider may need new interconnection facilities etc Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is wheeled away from the industrial Other initiatives in the order Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers  FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are required to be filed at FERC Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current including CBM and TRM Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service by July 1 and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02 Considers rolled in rates for generation interconnection rather than direct assignment that we have now Extends temporary waivers through 123101 of operating and efficiency standards for QFs  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates if sold in California and the WSCC FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching load ie if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection requests etc Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review Please let me know if you would like the order  Ray Alvarez 202-466-9170 and I 713-853-7007 can assist you with this  Thanks

bridget joneses of us out here e In My Tribe        October 14 2001        By ETHAN WATTERS                    It may be true that never marrieds are   saving themselves     for something better They may also be saving   the     institution of marriage while theyre at it          You may be like me between the ages of 25 and   39 single     a college-educated city dweller If so you   may have also     had the unpleasant experience of discovering   that you have     been identified by the US Census Bureau no   less as one     of the fastest-growing groups in America --  the never     marrieds In less than 30 years the number   of     never-marrieds has more than doubled   apparently pushing     back the median age of marriage to the oldest   it has been     in our countrys history -- about 25 years for   women and 27     for men          As if the connotation of never married   werent negative     enough the vilification of our group has been   swift and     shrill These statistics prove a titanic   loss of family     values according to The Washington Times   An article in     Time magazine asked whether picky women   were denying     themselves and society the benefits of   marriage and in     the process kicking off an outbreak of Sex   and the City     promiscuity In a study on marriage   conducted at Rutgers     University researchers say the social   glue of the     family is at stake adding ominously that   crime rates        are highly correlated with a large   percentage of     unmarried young males          Although I never planned it I can tell you   how I became a     never-married Thirteen years ago I moved to   San Francisco     for what I assumed was a brief transition   period between     college and marriage The problem was I   wasnt just     looking for an appropriate spouse To use the   language of     the Rutgers researchers I was soul-mate   searching     Like 94 percent of never-marrieds from 20 to   29 I too     agree with the statement When you marry you   want your     spouse to be your soul mate first and   foremost This     ber-romantic view is something new In a 1965   survey     fully three out of four college women said   theyd marry a     man they didnt love if he fit their criteria   in every     other way I discovered along with my friends   that finding     that soul mate wasnt easy Girlfriends came   and went as     did jobs and apartments The constant in my   life -- by     default not by plan -- became a loose group   of friends     After a few years that groups membership and   routines     began to solidify We met weekly for dinner at   a     neighborhood restaurant We traveled together   moved one     anothers furniture painted one anothers   apartments     cheered one another on at sporting events and   open-mike     nights One day I discovered that the   transition period I     thought I was living wasnt a transition   period at all     Something real and important had grown there   I belonged to     an urban tribe          I use the word tribe quite literally here   this is a     tight group with unspoken roles and   hierarchies whose     members think of each other as us and the   rest of the     world as them This bond is clearest in   times of     trouble After earthquakes or the recent   terrorist     strikes my instinct to huddle with and   protect my group     is no different from what Id feel for my   family          Once I identified this in my own life I began   to see     tribes everywhere I looked a house of   ex-sorority women in     Philadelphia a team of ultimate-frisbee   players in Boston     and groups of musicians in Austin Tex   Cities Ive come     to believe arent emotional wastelands where   fragile     individuals with arrested development mope   around     self-indulgently searching for true love   There are rich     landscapes filled with urban tribes          So what does it mean that weve quietly added   the tribe     years as a developmental stage to adulthood   Because our     friends in the tribe hold us responsible for   our actions I     doubt it will mean a wild swing toward   promiscuity or     crime Tribal behavior does not prove a loss   of family     values It is a fresh expression of them          It is true though that marriage and the   tribe are at     odds As many ex-girlfriends will ruefully   tell you     loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc on   romantic     relationships Not surprisingly marriage   usually signals     the beginning of the end of tribal membership   From inside     the group marriage can seem like a risky   gambit When     members of our tribe choose to get married   the rest of us     talk about them with grave concern as if   theyve joined a     religion that requires them to live in a   guarded compound          But we also know that the urban tribe cant   exist forever     Those of us who have entered our mid-30s find   ourselves     feeling vaguely as if were living in the   latter episodes     of Seinfeld or Friends as if the plot   lines of our     lives have begun to wear thin          So although tribe membership may delay   marriage that is     where most of us are still heading And it   turns out there     may be some good news when we get there   Divorce rates have     leveled off Tim Heaton a sociologist at   Brigham Young     University says he believes he knows why In   a paper to be     published next year he argues that it is   because people     are getting married later          Could it be that we who have been biding our   time in happy     tribes are now actually grown up enough to   understand what     we need in a mate What a fantastic twist --  we never     marrieds may end up revitalizing the very   institution     weve supposedly been undermining          And theres another dynamic worth considering   Those of us     who find it so hard to leave our tribes will   not choose     marriage blithely as if it is the inevitable   next step in     our lives the way middle-class high-school   kids choose     college When we go to the altar we will be   sacrificing     something precious In that sacrifice we may   begin to     learn to treat our marriages with the   reverence they need     to survive          Ethan Watters is a writer living in San     Francisco      Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at

indicating that the allocation proc ess does not comply with the tariff The allocation process I do not think  is the problem It is the way the rates are used today for PNR Today the  only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari ff rates If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t he range of dates of the specific deal then the rates must be loaded that  way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation process If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate then it looks for the next level which is your posted rates if no posted rates ar e found then it looks for tariff rates on PNR It sounds like to me that T W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis  load the total specific contract deal rate in CBS  Please let me know if there are other problems in the a llocation process itself Thanks Ramona -----Original

to use the nomination process and posted rates for PNR s ervice or revert back to entering into individual purchase orders for each  deal The individual purchase orders are not as convenient  but they provide bet ter clarity between the parties TWs allocation program uses the posted andor deal rates entered into CBS  when capacity is allocated It  does not calculate the greatest total c ost commitment System modifications are needed to determine which shipper has the greatest cost commitment  20 20 ---------------------- Forwarded by Michael BodnarETSEnron on 04042001 1017 AM

Subject09PNR questions You asked 091  For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days is it accepta ble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days or should TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance 09Answer  The tariff doesnt say  I believe this is a business decision Would we rather charge the same rate every day or are both parties OK wi th taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day  My understa nding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s ame day  I also understand that rather than documenting the rate in a con tract or other writing we rely on our posting  If we change our practice  and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate I recommend at  a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting  From a legal standpoi nt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet e-mail or other writing  While we may be indifferent after all Form M says the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary document ation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises 09Another thing  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers  the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance and ot her shippers the posted rate from day to day  However there can be no dis crepancy among similarly situated shippers  To avoid the appearance of dis crimination Id recommend choosing one method or the other if that is fea sible from a business standpoint 20 09Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers  here are my recommendations 09My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be  something to this effect  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B E CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE  If this looks  awkward to you lets discuss a better way to say it 09I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes  However if it is possible to do an e-mail or fax it could read  The rate applicable to Contract No   on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate posted on Transwesterns website for that day  Another option might be ju st to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement it wo uld not have to be done for each deal 2  If we have the following situation  Shipper A has parked

fantastic  We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic  We also hit the Bite which was really neat Glad you and Luke had a good time in the

sort of thing in seattle if you have a sec you may want to try seattleinsidercom--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and helpful i havent talked to luke yet so i dont exactly know my plans for the weekend unfortunately i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday night or head out and have drinks or both or whatever yall want to do the weather is supposed to be great this weekend but with seattle you never know my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for sure or a pullover or something it gets so darn cold at night-believe me you will be glad  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside ive already given you my cell phone number i think 2068519177 definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime on it if i dont answer i check it frequently and you can leave a message and ill call you back very exciting to have visitors from texas see you friday hopefully oh where are you staying bonnie -----Original

have been stuck on crutcheswhich Im guessing is no fun when youre riding public transportation  Anyway I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers  I hope youre still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago  It looks like you may have changed jobs already which I trust is a good thing for you  Im very anxious to see the city and all it has to offerthere is a part of me that has always thought Id like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants bars outdoor activities etc that would be great and maybe if youre in town we could get together for a meal or a drink Thanks a bunch Susan

havent talked to luke yet so i dont exactly know my plans for the weekend unfortunately i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday night or head out and have drinks or both or whatever yall want to do the weather is supposed to be great this weekend but with seattle you never know my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for sure or a pullover or something it gets so darn cold at night-believe me you will be glad  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside ive already given you my cell phone number i think 2068519177 definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday the number i have given you is my

Lisa said youd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutcheswhich Im guessing is no fun when youre riding public transportation  Anyway I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers  I hope youre still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago  It looks like you may have changed jobs already which I trust is a good thing for you  Im very anxious to see the city and all it has to offerthere is a part of me that has always thought Id like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants bars outdoor activities etc that would be great and maybe if youre in town we could get together for a meal or a drink Thanks a bunch Susan This e-mail is the property of
