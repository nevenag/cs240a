Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday.  I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed.  Pitiful but much needed.  Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.  Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday.  You can either call or email if you have any questions for me.  And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend.  I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination.

Craig,

Just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on Thursday.  I know your schedule has been busy of late, but I very much appreciated having the chance to speak with you regarding Cinergy and the Cincinnati area.  The types of roles available with the company at present struck me as both exciting and promising opportunities.  Good luck in the continued efforts to move the company in the desired direction and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thanks,
Susan

Hey...if you'd like to try and get together Thursday or Friday let me know.  I think a group is actually getting together Friday night for Ashlea Stuart's birthday, but I'd be willing to skip it (or go if you'd like to see some people).  Anyway, just drop me a note when you get a chance...I could definitely use a good chat session.

hey...

thanks for the birthday wish.  i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.  met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.  I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.

as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.

if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!

hope all is still going well with you.  i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  

talk to you soon,
Sue

btw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.

looks like the festivities start around 9:30 or so...which is probably when I'll get there.  I will of course have the cell phone in tow if you just want to call after your dinner.  maybe tonight will actually work and we can get a much needed live music fix.

Thanks anyway...I eventually tracked it down yesterday.  

And yes, the real world emphatically sucks.  Emily's got the right idea, avoid it at all costs.  Still, work's going all right for me.  My hours have dramatically improved, which is nice, and they actually let me take time off for vacation.  I'm reserving the weekend Emily mentioned in September so hopefully I'll see you there.

I'm sure you don't want me to remind you in detail of your own birthday experience?  Europa, the shrubs across the street?...and it wasn't 2 hours, more like an hour to an hour and a half.  Besides, I think Bass spent a little more time than myself praying to the porcelain god (at least I had the good sense to just pass out when I got home).

Theresa and Nicole,

Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  

Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:

	-36169000
	-36177000
	-33084000
	-33085000
	-33038000
	-31029000
	-33171000
	-33175000
	-116388
	-903145
	-IT-601
	-41066000
	-41075000

If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.

Thanks for all the help,
Susan

I don't know about the seating.  Do you have NCL tonight?  I can't remember if it's Monday or Tuesday.  Anyway, if we got there early enough, say 7:30 or 8:00, I bet we could find somewhere to sit.  Is that something you'd be able to do?

So did you make it in today?  Hope you're feeling better.  Wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert Sat. night.  Let me know because if we decide to go I'm going to buy the tickets today.  Also, Boone called about 11:45 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails.  The message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it (be forewarned, there is a lot of rambling).

Please don't send me any more compression services emails.  I have nothing to do with any of the information below and should probably not even have access to it...the Susan Scott you're looking for does not have the middle initial M.  There is no middle initial shown for her in the system.

Subject:	ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

Well, I think I managed to adequately disturb her yesterday.  Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo.  When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.  My immediate response, "Actually, I needed some solo time."  Subject closed.  As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.

I'm so sorry I've hurt you Boone...never my intention.  I had no idea you were so fragile, you hide it well.  Life at Enron is good but things have been pretty busy the last couple weeks.  I went to New Braunfels last Friday to visit one of Lisa and my friends (actually it's the girl we visited in London) and then had a wedding to go to Saturday night.  

No big plans for the 4th as of yet.  I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going to be...could be Houston, Austin or Georgetown.  I know, I know...I'm such a jet-setter.  How about yourself?  Planning another famous Boone BBQ.  Cooking commences at 3:00 am, right?  

Hope you're having a nice day.

None as of yet...so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what?...I figured from your last email you were a lock.  As for myself, I'm still  waiting to hear back from Corey about the concert, so I don't know what I'm doing yet either.  I would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but I don't think the times exactly work out.  Anything in the hopper for this evening?

Hello Susan!

I feel terrible that I haven't talked to you in so long.  Third year of med
school is a little on the crazy side!  I've been wanting to call you, but for
some reason, I can't find your phone number.  I called information, and tried
to call a Susan Scott in Houston, but I wasn't sure if it was the right one of
not.  (There were several)  So, just email your phone number to me (and your
address if you don't mind--I don't have your current one), and I will call you
tomorrow sometime--I'm on call tonight, so I won't be home until very late!

I hope you're doing well and not having to work so, so hard these days!  I
miss you and all the girls--we need a reunion soon!  Take care!

Love,
Elizabeth

There's a song both you and Mary are currently playing with the following lyrics..."and now I know for the first time too, all of the ways I've been lying to you.  It's not that I don't think we can't open up in time, it's just that I'm afraid of what we'll find."  Could you enlighten me as to the artist's name?  I keep forgetting to write it down.

Well...I would certainly be up for a little travel.  The following locations looked interesting to me.  

Biarritz, Dinard, Carcassone, Perpignan, St. Etienne or Nimes in France.  Cork, Kerry, Shannon, or Knock in Ireland.  Brussels in Belgium.  Turin, Pisa, Trieste, Venice, Pescara in Italy.  And....Alghero.  However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.

Get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.  Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.

Sue

Hey Bonnie,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

  Susan.M.Scott@enron.com wrote:  Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and
subsequently exhausted on Sunday. I basically rotated from my bed to the
couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed. Pitiful but much needed.
Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.

I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations=
 (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with Sam - How =
is Sam by the way?)  Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading mat=
erial has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I=
'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  How=
ever, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interes=
ting.  The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insani=
ty, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  I know it may sound a=
 little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.=
  If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've includ=
ed here.  There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of read=
ing right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith,=
 and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little =
slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does E=
leanor of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fo=
ndness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't=
 put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoya=
ble.  Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniquen=
ess of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to resea=
rch for the book.
Hope this helps you out a bit.  As for the "Peacers" comment...Definitely t=
hink we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recogniz=
e our own strength and endurance.  Contrary to God not knowing anything abo=
ut us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique abilit=
y to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for l=
ife.  It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?  But, =
in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are =
and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we ha=
ve to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).  Sorry, I know=
 I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of think=
ing lately - and much of it at church.=20
Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in Austin over the fourth, =
but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.  And, I'll keep l=
ooking for you name on the Enron Field scoreboard.
Later,
Susan

In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good boo=

 but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.

No worries....We can chat tonight.  I wanted to talk to you about President's Day weekend anyway, and I need to do some research on that front today.  Thanks for thinking of me though (if it makes you feel any better, I forgot it was my birthday yesterday morning until Mom gave me my present).

Susan,

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Chuck that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Chuck started Air
Assault School yesterday, and that's turned everything
upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed
you last night!

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?

This whole experience must be too much fun for you...getting to work with a=
ll these young pilots (any of them single?) and strutting your stuff. =20

The trip to Park City was fantastic.  We had some really good meals and man=
aged two solid days of skiing.  It dumped 2 feet of snow Sunday night so we=
 had tons of powder on Monday to ski through...and to cushion our falls.  T=
uesday was absolutely beautiful, sunny but still below freezing.  The views=
 from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking.  Mon=
ique took all the pictures on her digital camera, so as soon as she uploads=
 them I'll be able to check them out and order a few.  This is my first day=
 back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another=
 floor pretty soon...too much sensitive information up here I suppose.  It'=
s fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who dec=
lined the UBS offer and will be housed on the other floor as well, so I wil=
l have company.  I've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job =
front...another company in Seattle and one in Richmond, VA that my old trad=
er Larry told me about.  I'm still glad I made the decision I did and am ex=
cited to see where that choice ultimately leads me.  Even Tobin (from my fi=
rst group here at Enron) is trying to help my find something in the Pacific=
 Northwest.  I'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his a=
cquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations. =20

Glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the "effort", and=
 I'll talk to you soon.

Love,=20

Suz, I'm using both addresses since I don't know which one is current.
Guess that you had a good time at Monique's and did a little skiing.  Hope
that work is going as well as it can under the circumstances.  We are
flying and having a good time out here.  It's fun to work with the Navy
again.  This time it is the carrier  Abraham Lincoln and her battle group.
 mostly we make attacks on her and fighters like F-14s and F-18's come up
and intercept us.  We are carrying electronic pods which jam and deceive
their radars and everybody gets some good training.  Yesterday I just got
out to the area which is south of San Clemente island off the coast of
Southern California and had a generator failure.  I was with another A-4
and he continued the mission.  I went back to Pt.Mugu and jumped into
another airplane and got back out for the second and third runs.  The whole
thing just about wore me out but it felt good to get the mission
accomplished.  Love, Dad

SU-san!  how are you?  i am having s. scott withdrawal!  clay and i have been having a wonderful time in london and traveling (class two days a week makes traveling easy!).  i have been meaning to get in touch with you forever!!

we have a terrible time emailing because the school computers are terrible and we don't have internet at home.  last time i sat down in the school lab, i was emailing you when a professor walked in and said the room was reserved for a class...anyway...can't complain...we are truly in heaven save the school part!

how are you?  how is work...must be pretty stressful right now?  how is your brother?  are they still in Korea?  did you enjoy visiting them?  will their location be affected by the sept 11 attacks?  i can't believe i haven't talked to you for sooo long!

let me know how you are doing!
miss you much...will you come to jen's wedding?  we will be there!

look forward to seeing you soon.

love and a big hug from me and clay!

Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

Sue

PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.

It was indeed an area bequeathed with natural beauty and with minimal pollution. When the pictures come out I will be sure to let you see them. I arrived back at 2am last night - I actually feel good now, which is rather odd given the general level of exertion the past few days. Yet it had been too long since I sat in front of a fire away from civilization as we know it and passed around a bottle of whiskey. Very therapeutic for the soul. Now it is time for some more Enron therapy once again, for an indefinate period of time... Perhaps you would be interested in going out with Tobin and myself on Thursday to the front porch? That is another form of therapy that I quite enjoy...

Enjoy your day,

Ben

Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Houston the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.

Paul's deal with Petrogulf is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

Thanks Theresa.

Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to
do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday. I will ask though.
You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and
leaving Korea on Sunday). The total air fare should be $962. Shoot me
a quick e mail if this is not ok. Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing
your tickets this afternoon. Thanks!

Subject:	Dallas to visit Katy

I spoke to Katy last night and she mentioned that each of us had expressed interest in going to visit her in Dallas. Right now Southwest has flights to Dallas for $60. Would the 2 of you be interested in taking a trip up there either the weekend of Nov. 3 or Nov. 10?

Let me know because I am going to purchase a ticket for one of those weekends.

Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.

no, i don't really.....do you have ideas??  we have a couple options:  there is an easter service in some flower fields that are just beautiful and have an ocean view- if it's nice, it might be a unique place to go for a service.  otherwise, there's always my parent's church, but that's rather far so i've already set them up for us not joining them.  there is another church in my area which a bunch of friends go to, but to which i've never been.....i'll send out the email and find out where everyone is going this weekend.....let me know if you've heard of good brunch places!

Wow...I must say this was the last thing I expected you to be emailing me about.  I'll try and give you a call after work ( around 4:30 or so ) if you want to talk about it some more, just let me know.  I do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you.  

Sorry to hear about Jay...that is horrible.  What brings on shingles anyway?  I thought it has something to do with stress, but I could be totally off.

Glad you like the CD...I've been listening to it non-stop.  I'm totally empowered after "I'm Alright" and then plunge into super-reflective mode with "Wildest Dreams".  Get on the Kim Richey web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why.  By the way, she's playing at Stubb's on June 14th and in Houston at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge on the 16th....food for thought.

As for my call, there was some news...he contacted me around 10 am or so and we chatted throughout the day.  I'll tell you more about it when I call, but you're only going to be a bigger fan.  That of course is the problem I'm having.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Hey Susan-
I got your message last night but it was late-- Doug and I went to see Pearl Harbor.  I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I did.
I took him to work this morning, and he was asking me about the law firm parties this summer-- was he going to be coming in for them, etc.  Although I hadn't planned to, I suggested that we take the summer off from dating.  We had a long conversation about it, and he was much better about it than he has been in the past.  It made me wonder...  He said he had thought about that kind of thing, too, but didn't want to do it.  But, if I needed it, he said he would be okay with it.  He did say he might join the Marines rather than go to law school.  I have always thought that is what he wanted to do, so maybe I am being less selfish by breaking up with him.  I don't know.  I feel pretty bad about it.  I just think this is probably a mistake, but I explained to him that I have had a boyfriend my entire adult life and I am wondering what it would be like without one.  He is in just about the same boat reagrding having had a ! girlfriend for the vast majority of his adult years.
Anyway, we might have lunch together, and we will definitely talk about it after he gets home from work.
On another note, Jay has shingles.  Isn't that sad.  I looked it up in my medical book-- they are very painful and leave scars-- and she has them on her face.  How awful!
I bought that Kim Richey CD yesterday.  I love it!
Were you calling with any news?

Anita,

Please send this note to all identified participants in the Transmission Round Table-

To all Transmission Round Table participants:

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next "Round Table" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Enron person, but particulars to Walter Coffer.

"Current Transmission Project"

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our "Transmission Round Table" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)

5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

6) Go to work now!

I am sooooo sorry I'm not going to be able to make the party.  Please give everyone my best and tell Jen I would have done everything within my power to embarass her.  I'm actually going to be in S. Korea visiting my brother and sister-in-law, so I do have a legitimate excuse.

See you at the wedding if not before.

We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in San Antonio at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.  There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Bellamy Brothers were?)

As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.  Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.  I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.  Plenty of time to do something interesting right?

Sue

I'm not going to tell Lisa for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight.

staying w/ me.....merci beaucoup.  am DEFINITELY going to have drinks w/ her
swedish delicacy.  prob not good considering the drinking binge i've been on
since germany.  am suggesting you begin upping the ante while drinking for
the next few weeks before you get here.  am warning you- it may be ugly.
did you get tickets to the eagles?  if you don't, you can just chill at the
pub or jaunt off w/ an enron person while we're gone and we can meet up
later.  am going to try to call in an hr if i don't pass out- literally have
had 12+ pints, and vision is blurring....if can't chat now, will call
tomorrow....

Hi Julie, 

I just wanted to touch base with you one last time before I arrive in Seattle and make sure that I have the correct time and location for our meeting.  As we discussed, I intend to arrive at your offices at 9:00 am Friday morning.  To reconfirm, you are located on the 15th floor of the One Bellevue Center Building (411 108th Avenue N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004).

I will be staying in downtown Seattle Thursday night and will have my cell phone if you need to reach me for any reason - (713) 775-6472. 

I look forward to meeting and talking with you tomorrow.

Susan

She lives!!!!  I know it's been ages since we've caught up on each other's =
lives.  I'm anxious to hear what's happening in yours in the upcoming month=
s.  I'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk.  =
As for a visit, you know I'm always up for a trip out to the coast.  I'm ac=
tually heading to Seattle next weekend with a friend from work and then Aug=
ust is going to be filled with a trip to Denver (work related...I know toug=
h) and a visit to S. Korea to see Chris and Chuck for a week and a half or =
so.  I'm really excited about that trip...I think we're going to try and ta=
ke a weekend jaunt somewhere like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing while I'm=
 there.  So given all of that, what are your thoughts on Labor day weekend?=
  It's the first weekend of September...automatic 3 day weekend for me, so =
I could fly in around the same time I did on my last visit that Friday and =
leave Monday afternoon.  Let me know if that sounds good, or if there's som=
e other weekend you had in mind. =20

You'll have to tell both of the Eric's and Clint I said, "Hello."  I had su=
ch a great time hanging out with all of them, and your cousin too.  You att=
ract very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent comp=
any.  By the way, how are things in regards to Clint...still just good hang=
-out buddies?  I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email th=
at things with Brendan are still good and if so, I'm glad for you. =20

I went shopping at Stein Mart recently too and found some really cute thing=
s, I absolutely love that store.  And, I'm honored to be your shopping muse=
.

Love,
Susan

PS - The job's still good and I miss you too.

Hey Em,

Hope the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet.  I just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset (aside from getting physically ill at Teala's Friday night...it was ugly).  Nick emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.  When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.  They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.  To top everything off, he's moving back to Houston in three weeks...ughh.  Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.  Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.

Ta for now,
Sue

i'm a total dork....before my last trip to seattle i sent away for the visitor bureau's tourist packet...

anyway, i was looking through it this weekend and it turns out i actually have a coupon for the symphony.  nothing big, something like 10% off, but i'd just thought i'd let you know.

hope you had a great weekend and i'll talk to you soon,
Susan

btw...i also have coupons for the IMAX and some other attractions.

hey....just an fyi, we talked last night...conversation took less than 5 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said, or not said if that makes any sense.  anyway, i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead.

.....the guy actually said that he was "bummed"....that choice of words did wonders for me....i mean, you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal....it's just not enough that someone be "bummed" by the prospect of never being with me again.

talk to you later,

Hi Sarah,

So nice to here from you....

I'm actually still employed right now, but don't have a heck of a lot to do around here.  We're all in somewhat of a holding pattern, waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy etc.  Hope all is well with you!  I haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation.  My roommate and I have movers coming the weekend before Christmas and as of right now I had just planned on moving back in with the folks...on a temporary basis of course!  Anyway, I'm just not really sure where I'll be 2 or 3 months from now, so I'm obviously reluctant to sign any long term leases etc.  If a temporary roommate is something you guys would be interested in I'd certainly like to discuss the prospect w/ you...but I would also completely understand if you'd prefer to get somebody in there who's more permanent.

My number at work is 713-853-1455 and home is 713-622-2788....

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey Susan,

How are you? I've wanted to catch up with you and see how things are going?
I wanted to find out about your job etc? Also, I am not sure if you decided
on your living situation but if you are looking, one of my roommates is
going to move out at the end of this month and I wanted to see if maybe you
were interested. It is a 3 bedroom cute house on the border of Montrose and
West U. Give me a call when you get a chance or send me your number and I
will call you. 713-522-5881.

Talk soon,
Sarah

I just talked to Leslie, and we decided to go to dinner together.  Then, as we were getting off the phone, she said, "Is it OK if Joe comes with us."  I felt like I was going to cry-- literally-- my voice cracked when I said, "Sure...."  She said she couldn't believe how great things were between them right now.  I might die!
Well there's the turbulence in my world-- how's yours?

Okay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.  Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy.

Talk to you later,
Sue

so obviously i decided against coming up this weekend...ha.  on the one hand i thought it be nice to hang out today and have a little distraction before your apt., but then i thought it might be better for you to have the day to reflect, prep, etc.  anyways, just wanted to see how you're doing and since you do have the day off i figured you'd be popping into the cafe at some point.

got an email from Lisa...so she is at the school and sounded ok.  it was a short mass email.  hope to getter a longer one at a later date.  

talk to you soon,

Hey,

Just remembered that Cory Morrow is playing at the Firehouse Friday night and Owen Temple is going to be at the Mucky Duck.  If you have any interest in doing something Friday let me know.  Maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play.  I figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day Saturday with Mom, and Sunday is Mother's day...so Friday seems like the best day to get together.  Either email me when you get a chance or just give me a call sometime this week and let me know if any of this sounds good to you.

Susan

hey- am getting ready for the austria trip- very jazzed!  not about the 4 am
wake-up call, though.....kates and kelley got here yesterday, then left
again this morn. for stockholm.  they'll be back thurs night, me, the next
night.  am excited about you (and lisa, i guess...) getting here next week.
should be fun.  haven't given up on the chance for a jaunt off, but will
have to be last min, and have to keep cking at ryanair and
www.webweekends.com for updates as they come....if you get a chance at work,
try to do some browsing....also, some annoying requests- katy forgot all the
minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our Eagles marg party,
and the jerky from dad - suspiciously, she remembered my pocket-sized
neosporin tube......but anyways, it would be FABULOUS if you and lisa could
each cart over 3-4 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic
(carry-on....obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase!)
doesn't matter if thaws, but will need approx 7-10 tubes for the
festivities, plus, dad has that great turkey jerky from NB to send
along....he said he'd get it to sally, then to you somehow.  only if it's
convenient....but the limeaide would be a lifesaver!  tell lisa it's her
"rent"  for a last-min invite w/o ever asking.....any thoughts about shows
or activities you want to see?  know all the tourist stuff has been done, so
any partic. shows?  restaurants?  let me know...as i said, have been cking
on ryanair updates, but still no grt deals- must wait til newest deals come
out, so since i won't have computer in austia, must put you in charge of
cking....clearly, lisa will be of no help in this dept, so we must take this
into our own hands.....we'll see.....ok- am off.  will try to call when i
get bk to london fri- hope memorial day was fab....

Hi Julie,

Thanks for resending the message.  I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.  It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.  If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.  Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.  If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.  I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.

If you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott

Just got to work...I know, it's ridiculous.  Anyway, just let me know if you can break for lunch...if so I can meet you in your building and we can hit the food court.  Lunch can easily be accomplished in 30 mins if you're crunched for time.

So...the weekend I was talking about coming to Austin the following people are playing:

	Fri	The Fabulous Thunderbirds	Gruene Hall
	Fri	Cory Morrow			Luckenbach Dance Hall

	Sat	Reckless Kelly			Antone's
	Sat	Lucinda Williams		Gruene Hall

Just more food for thought.

Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  

Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  

I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow?  I am coming in town tomorrow, but I

Hey Tobin,

Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.  I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.

Susan

Caycie,

I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe both you and Jen got engaged on the same weekend.  I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.  You know I think Briggs is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.  I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous).

I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Austin the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Jessica will still be in town, as will Corey, and Jen had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see.

Love,
Sue

PS - Are you coming in for Deborah's wedding?

I will definitely think about it...I would just feel bad though missing the event since I talked to Barrett (Deborah's fiancee) all about the big day at Lisa and Brad's wedding.  What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility.

I think you can skip Deborah's wedding.  Your good excuse is that I have to
work the next weekend.  Starting on Thursday (the 10th), I have to do Law
Review stuff until the issue we are working on is finished.  It could be two
weeks-- it could be right up until I have to start work...  I don't really
know.  Of course, I won't be working all day everyday, so we could do
dinner, a movie, etc. that weekend.

I don't want to encourage you not to go to Deborah's wedding, but, frankly,
I am all weddinged out.  Have you made plans to go with anyone?  Maybe
something could mysteriously come up...

Oh well-- it's up to you-- you could decide next Saturday if you want to...

Hey Holly,

Just wanted to let you know that I'm flying in Sunday evening for an interview on Monday.  Bonnie and I are talking about going out to dinner, nothing big, and were wondering if you might have any interest.  Let me know your thoughts and if I don't here back from you via email I'll just try giving you a buzz this weekend.  Hope things are going well.

Subject:	FERC Announces Technical Conference on RTO Seams Coordination

On December 15, 2000, EPSA, ELCON, Enron, Reliant and Dynegy filed a request for FERC to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 requirements.  Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

I have to be in S.A. on the 6th for Lisa's bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to Austin Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.  Just a thought.  If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.  Hope you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction.

Hi guys!

I have been incredibly disorganized about the rsvps for Caycie's party this
weekend - so if you have already sent it in, I am so sorry!

Please email me back and let me know if you will be there for the Friday
night dinner (8:00 - Wimberly) and if you want to get a manicure/peticure
on Saturday.

Thanks!

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday.  I will ask though.  You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and leaving Korea on Sunday).  The total air fare should be $962.  Shoot me a quick e mail if this is not ok.  Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing your tickets this afternoon.  Thanks!

Hey buddy,

Out of curiosity, what all are you bringing with you to San Antonio?  I'm running into some problems in the area of cocktail dresses as I developed some noticeable tan lines from my trip.  Oh well, I guess they're not that big a deal right?  

Also, do you just want to swing by my complex Friday morning to pick me up?  I promise not to run too late.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

I think it's probably a good idea not to contact Eric for a while.  Truly what purpose would it serve?  As for my work situations, they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me.  I'll tell you about them on my next visit.  See, I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there.  Please don't worry about flapping Sat night.  I certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part.  To tell the truth, I worry at times that I'm not learning enough of the life lessons...just kind of staying in a very safe, secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture.  Enough self-analysis.  Have a good evening....you should his jazz night at Epizote just for me.

Sue

how fun- i totally forgot that you're off to vegas this weekend!  thanks for the input about clint- you're right, and i hadn't realized that i fit his "type" until he defined it.   now i know why he's so nice to me!  he does know about brendan, of course, but since i don't always behave like i have a boyfriend it's easy for guys to not take him too seriously.....not good.  i'm also embarrassed that i flapped away in the car on saturday night- hope you don't think horrible things about me.  although it's okay if you do- i think horrible things about myself every now and then! but i always attribute it to the lessons of life.....i'm curious about your work situations- you've never mentioned them.  that is truly uncomfortable and i have not had to deal with that here.....

keep me posted on your exciting life!  otherwise, i'm doing the right thing to not contact eric, right?  so silly for me to ask, but i like being friends with him (probably the flirting is fun), but it's a dead end.....

I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.  The
retaliation/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be
tempting.  My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any
representative of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very
short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry
about the lecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just
utter flapping as in my case).

Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your
friends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from
Clint, he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were
you though...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get
the impression that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal
interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.
However, if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's
a great guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in 
couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their
feelings to me and I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same
way...something that's hard for them to grasp given the fact that some
flirting at some point did occur).

Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much
sleep.  Oh well, life is tough.

Susan

hey susan-  thought you'd appreciate this funny email from Clint in
London....  so in brief, my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart
broken (per "Someone Like You") and therefore must act like a slut to
ignore the pain.  Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at
the padres game.....i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on
saturday.  at first he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i
do care about him (on some level), but as i drank more i LECTURE more,
until he finally started walking away from me!  how embarrassing!  i am
totally embarrassed that i wouldn't shut up!  even more surprised that eric
sent me the email on monday.  i didn't see it until tuesday since i didn't
work monday, but am bummed because i called him monday evening to get eric
ang's phone number.....silly concern, but he probably thinks i was calling
just to get in touch with him.  now  i will totally not make contact with
him- not even respond to his email...don't need to overinflate people's
egos!

i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so
months!! i love that you have so much fun here, and everyone always
comments on how cool you are and how easy you are to be around.....everyone
would be thrilled to have you back! (me especially!)  i'll watch for good
fares, too!

write back whenever you can....talk to you soon-

afternoon. i may need to hang out at the beach to recover from the jet lag.
jeff was very curious and mentioned to a colleague in london that i had
very good company at the beach.  i assured him that you were not married--
he was confused by your ring-- and so was i when i first saw you cruising
the halls. he thought we must be dating but i straighted him out. told him
that you were all over me at the beach after he left (just kidding!)

so are you taking friday off?

Julie,

Thanks for letting us hang out with you on the beach Sat.  It was good to
see you.  All your friends are very cool.  Say thanks to Clint for me if
you
get the chance.  We didn't last much longer that night, thank goodness.
I hope you had a nice Easter.  Other than the Lakers beating the Blazers it
was a pretty boring day.  Not to mention I was brain dead from the pickling
the two days before.
Have a good week.

Hey there,

Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!  

Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you tonight.

Sue

I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So...

Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will
be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that
Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you
want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his boss,
so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out.

However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next
two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours.
Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time.
And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate
to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is
really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend?

Hey,

Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.  

So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed.

I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue

good luck w/ the car shopping!!!  i'm anxious to hear what transpires...

as for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.  but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in.  i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden "illness", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to "stay sober" so to speak and kick the habit for good.

talk to you soon,
Sue

Sorry I never got back to you last night...I ended up going to grab dinner.  I'm still up for this evening if you are.  The "show" starts at 8:00 and I think it's about a $10.00 cover.  Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.  I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great.

See ya later,

Hey Bonnie,

I talked to Pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.

I spoke to Matt on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.

I'll talk to you soon and keep you updated,
Susan

Btw...that cute place on 4th Ave in Queen Anne was already rented.

hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.

have you spoken with matt????  any more updates with that?

happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)

Take care

Is there something I need to do in regards to this email.  I appears some coding information needs to be filled out for my cell phone.

I'll bet it does belong to the other Susan.  I've never signed you up for Cingular Wireless.  I do have other PrimeCo bills from before you came to the department that I do need to complete that expense report.  We just got instructions today on how to get into the new "upgraded" system (XMS).  I will process these as soon as possible and pass them on to Legal for approval.  If I have any trouble, I'll let you know.

If I have to learn another password around here, I'm gonna croak.................(just kidding).

Linda, I checked this out and it is an invoice for Cingular Wireless for 80 some-odd dollars.  I do not have Cingular service; my mobile phone is from PrimeCo.
Have you had any trouble getting my PrimeCO bills processed?
Did you order any service for me from Cingular?
Just asking because I think this e-mail might have needed to go to the other Susan Scott.

I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like "good buddy" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.  

On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.  I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out.

NO!  again, sue- you are giving lisa too much credit- assuming she is
capable of a motivation or thought that is BEYOND our comprehension!  the
truth is, you DO understand, just don't it to be the truth- it's a dark,
scary place to go!  basically, she wants to "show off"  what she HAS, and
yet again, PRAY you will be in full veg mode, looking as pitiful as, say, i
do rt now- on my couch, eating gummy bears- thoroughly enjoying my wasted
existance- so that she can further convince the oh-so-dimple mitch that he
"picked the RIGHT roomie!"  and i honest to god think she DOES think that
way.  or, perhaps, spending quality alone time w/ him would incenuate too
much of a relationship, and when she tries to "capture" the swiss boy's
affection (while cleverly using a visit w/ her good pal em as a
justification) she won't feel as bad- i mean, she and mitch WEREN'T that
close...at least, SHE wasn't.....no harm, no foul.  whoa.  should i be a
therapist, or what.  or be IN therapy- can channel people's "dark sides" so
easily, it MUST be a sign....must use my powers for good, must use my powers
for good....!

hey...how's it going?

sorry i've haven't emailed in so long...things have been busy.  btw, matt did decide to take the job with UBS.

as for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.  they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.  meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.  living at home has been interesting.  mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.  still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.

i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.  i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.  also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!  babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.

talk to you soon,
susan

the pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.  take care.

Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the
first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???

i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work
out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very
excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did
a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job
lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean
break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to
 relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you
have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the
moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a
paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant
believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...
just excited to hear.

yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in
houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they
accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.
anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail
 email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent
been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to
find you if you leave enron soon.

talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week
 in kodai.

Thanks Theresa.

Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.

I'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I would definitely enjoy the opportunity to answer any of your questions about the various opportunities within Enron.  I know what an overwhelming place this can be at times.  I'm actually heading out of the office today for a conference in Denver, but if you want to just email me some questions or pick a time that would be good for you to meet that would be great.

hi Susan,

My name is Aarati Siva, and I'm a summer analyst intern in EES (with the Load desk within Commodity Risk Management).  Priya Jaisinghani suggested I contact you when I mentioned to her that I'd like to talk to a couple of people  to find out more about Enron and its different businesses. 
 I don't know if Priya told you, but I met her when she came down to represent Enron at our school last semester (the University of Virginia).  I caught up with her a few weeks ago over lunch, which is when she suggested some analyst resources for me to speak with.  I'm a finance/economics major and hope to work here full time next year (if I get an offer!)...but I still am not sure where I'd like to work within Enron.   I was wondering if you had the time to tell me a little bit about what you're doing, and how you're liking it so far?  She told me you traded gas, and I'm eager to find out about trading opportunities, in particular, so I thought it would be wise to talk to someone currently involved with that.  If its not possible that's not a problem, I understand its a busy time for everybody just about now.  But if you could that'd be great - it wouldn't have to be long, I just wanted to get a little direction and advice from people who've worked in different places.  Thanks!

Cheers,
Aarati

They should if they are dealing with transport, gas daily options,  etc. which are effected by the omicrons.  I would typically go to the leads of the respective regions, tell them which curves are unmapped and let them decide what omicron curve to use ( a lot of times they just asked the trader in charge of that point which curve to use).  

If the leads don't know what the omicron curves are the company's in trouble!

you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

Thanks,

Okay...so here's the link.  Once you get to the sight, click on About APB and then Just for Fun.  Once you're on the Just for Fun page click on Derby 2001 and go to the last picture on the first row.  You can read the names from there.  

Hope the first day at the new office is going well.  Give me a call sometime and let me know what the scoop is regarding Wednesday and the baseball game.  I'm anxious to hear if you talked to Leslie again after the cryptic phone call on Saturday.

Sue

btw....not only no contact, but not said individual's not even logging into messenger...I think this where people tend to say "stick a fork in it."

Hey Lisa,

Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.

Thanks,
Sue

It happens to me pretty regularly.

Time:  Yesterday around 4:30 pm

Conversation:

Him:	yo
Me:	hey
Him:	guess what
Me:	what
Him:	i'm an engaged man
Him:	that kind of came out of nowhere huh

There was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.

So are you heading up to Austin today?

Hate to be the party pooper but, based on the events today and this entire week, a shot contest is the last thing on my mind.

I called and left a message requesting two tickets for the reception...I will let you know if we get them.  I'll try and give you a call later today.  I'm not actually leaving until Thursday for the Caymans though, so if you're up for steak night etc. Wednesday night let me know.  It can't be a late night for packing reasons, but I'd like to do something.

Susan

Would love to get together again sometime, but I'll think I'll let someone else take over as far as the shot contests go...I was the champ - though ultimately of what I'm not sure.  Frightening as it is I felt fine on Saturday, however from what I've heard that wasn't exactly the case with Bass.

Thanks again,
Susan

(You'll probably be receiving words of gratitude from me for a while to come)

Adriane,

Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those
things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you
feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now
barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly)
and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find
the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will
be able to stick to the new limit.

Thanks again,
Susan

Subject:	Texas - Retail Market

Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI.  This details out verious aspects of the Texas retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Texas market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for EPMI to enter the Texas Retail market by January 1, 2002.  
	1)  Complete ERCOT LSE application
	2)  Review market requirements
	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
		Delivery Service Agreement
		Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Authorization
		Electronic Data Exchange Trading Partner Agreement

Please feel free to contact me at 712-366-3399 or page me at 888-912-1426, if you have any questions or if I can be of assistance in getting EPMI in the Texas Retail Market.

1)  Need to complete the ERCOT LSE application, copy attached.  ERCOT Contact for assistance:  Karen Berman 512-248-3171
 
2)  Need to review background information from ERCOT Protocol Sections #15 (Customer Registration) and #19 (Texas Standard Electronic Transactions), copies attached.
  
3)  I have attached a copy of a Texas Market Analysis that I prepared for EES.  The general rules are identical for each TDSP service territory.  This provides details of the implementation requirements.
 
4)  EDI Implementation Guides (Version 1.4) to support the Texas Market Opening January 1, 2002, have just been released.  This Version will be the basis for Flight 1001 testing.  Additional information including scenario maps, change control process, etc., can be found at http://www.ercot.com/Tac/RetailISOAdHocCommittee/Customer/SET/keydocs/Keydocs.htm.

 
5)  There is a detailed EDI testing plan in place for Texas.  This testing process is administered by the Independent Third Party Testing Administrator (ITPTA).  The website where all of this information can be reviewed is http://itpta.intellimark-it.com/.  Attached is the Testing Signoff Worksheet that must be completed prior to beginning the testing process.  Tentative key testing dates for Flight 1001 (the last testing flight for January 1, 2002 market opening) are:
	August 30th		Mandatory Market Orientation for Trading Partners
	September 11th		All paperwork must be submitted for testing
	September 13th		Flight 1001 Connectivity Testing will begin
	September 27th		Flight 1001 Kickoff

Just wanted to say, "thanks gals" for dinner last night.  To be honest with you I had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better, but I had a really good time last night....I forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends.  Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.  I know it's rarely overt, but I've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what I'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough.

Paul,

So nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going great for you as well.  I'm actually going Laura Jahnke's wedding that same evening.  Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.  Please tell Nathan I say, "hello" and wish he and his new wife the very best.  So when does school start?  And, how are the small businesses going?

Have a nice time at the wedding,
Susan

ok girls...sue, haven't called you bk yet w/ the 411, and kates, haven't
heard back from you after i left the past couple messages, so this could end
up being a collosal disaster, but went ahead and made reservations at Garson
for 7:45 tonight.  it's on hillcroft btwn westheimer and 59...super scary
area on "wrong" side of westeimer, but have reliable sources who've raved,
and since was close to Hart, have driven past several times and looked safe,
  persian food, which is i'm not exactly sure what.....but supposed to have
good meze, kebabs, and persian ice cream.  hope y'all are in.  could be
supremely embarrsaing to dine solo in semi-formal middle eastern restaurant
w/ no bar....luby's or cafe express is one thing....a belly dancer's haunt
is quite another!  chat soon, mes amis...

I recently had the following wine at Wahso in Park City, Utah - USA...

I was wondering if you could tell me of a distributor or retailer from whom the wine might be purchased.  I currently reside in Houston, TX but will be making a trip to Seattle, WA in the next couple weeks.

Thank you,

once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from =
the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the=
 point is that i recently found them again and reread them today.  i think =
you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fr=
esh eyes....

"the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world =
would first order their national life; those who desired to order their nat=
ional life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regul=
ate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who d=
esired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right=
; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills=
 sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive =
at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of =
things.  when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reac=
hed; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will=
 is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then=
 the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, the=
n the home life is regulated; when the home life is regulated the national =
life is orderly; and when the national life is orderly, then the world is a=
t peace.  from the emperor down to the common man, the cultivation of the p=
ersonal life is the foundation for all.  it is impossible that when the fou=
ndation is disorderly, the superstructure can be orderly.  there has never =
been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and str=
ong.  there is a cause and a sequence in things, and a beginning and end in=
 human affairs.  to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning o=
f wisdom."

right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. "exploration of kno=
wledge of things"...and i think the "things" in this instance refer to thos=
e "things" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually.  =
i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think =
to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent=
 those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you ca=
n't jump the sequence of things.  now is the time for exploration, and i be=
lieve you are well on your way in that regard, but above all you must remem=
ber that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this process=
.

hope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.

SueBob

I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.

Thanks, But No Thanks: Turning Down the Offer
by Carole Martin
	[IMAGE]	
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	
	[IMAGE]	

In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, "Thanks, but no thanks."
Great News; You've Got an Offer
George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?
It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.
How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?
Do What You Want
The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. "Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do," was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.
When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. "Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable," she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.
Making the Call
The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. "I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position," he told the manager. "I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future." The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.
It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.

Hi Ashley,

It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.  Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.

Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together. 

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Susan,

I know this is a bit random, but I know that you had maybe mentioned coming
over to London for a year.  I have no idea if this will pan out, but I am
looking for a roommate.  If you were comign over and might want to be my
roommate, I would be super excited.  I live in a really cool area in teh
middle of everything and do not want to have to give up the flat.  It is
actually really cheap rent at ?200 a week or so.  the little man who owns
it lives next door and keeps different flowers planted depending on the
season.

If you are not coming, or just do not want to be my roommate, do  you think
you could keep your ears open for anyone you know who might be moving over.
Do you think your friend who you were visiting might need a roommate?

Think on it and let me know any feedback.
Take care,
Ashley

Subject:	El Paso 1110 Update (9/5)

Here's the latest on El Paso line #1110...

Line #1110 is expected to be back online during this week following the installation of a release valve.
Sources at El Paso report that when #1110 comes back up, there will be no significant increase of capacity flowing through the South Main Line System because there is currently no market demand for the increase.
The OPS corrective action order is expected to be lifted later this fall, thereby granting the system permission to return to full capacity. However, there is a possibility that El Paso will not increase capacity on the system even then. This will depend on market demand at that time.

We will continue to follow this situation and will update you as significant developments occur. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Vegas trip was pretty interesting.  Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.  Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (Houston time) - 
(713) 775-6472.

If I'd spent any longer  than three days in that town I'd be dead right now.  I think the earliest I made it back to my room was around 6:45 am.

Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to=
 put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging i=
n the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and=
 I think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various situa=
tions, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance, am I =
going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you =
suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear any=
thing about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure=
 Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in the mor=
ning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)  Supposedly, it'=
s going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturd=
ay as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.  As for brunch on=
 Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestio=
ns... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa, Trattoria Acqu=
a and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of Pacifica Del M=
ar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration.=
..There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option (but i=
f your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously=
 and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above, in addition to T=
he Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill, also sounded goo=
d for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and your own opinion=
) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport =
somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what time people typicall=
y go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night. =20

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help=
 out with a few suggestions.

Love,
Susan

Subject:=09Entities that do not need FERC power marketing authorization

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to =
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC lic=
enses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF =
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In=
 most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless thei=
r primary business is as a utility, like Enron). =20

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform c=
ertain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site gen=
eration customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let y=
ou know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni=
cipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing au=
thorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=
ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=
 governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=
 commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=
tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =
instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=
ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=
oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=
h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =
reference thereto."

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=
ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =
state agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=
 exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=
rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=
s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=
 rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=
thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=
st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=
ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =
but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=
 a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=
 status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

I know I've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary.  I can honestly say, I think this is the first time I've been invited to an Aggie happy hour....and to that end, kudos to all those who opted out of Sam's Boat...you now may be forced to deal with a longhorn interloper.

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?

Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  

I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?

Susan

Maybe I'll hit an "Eaters" outing.

I just got a call from Susan Ginsberg at El Paso.  It seems they have heard from FERC staff that INGAA is showing up an awful lot to talk about the marketing affiliate rule and why there should not be any changes, but they wonder why, if they really are separate companies, the affiliates have not been in to talk to FERC themselves.  I think we have already heard this message, but El Paso wants to set up a group to go into FERC.  THey are setting up a conference call for next Thur with some other companies to discuss this issue.  I told them we would be in on the call (we don't have to, tho) but that we may not want to go into FERC with that group.  

Would anyone like to be on the call next week, or have any problem with my participation in the call?  Shall we talk about going to FERC to give them our position?  (or should we just tell them to read our comments)

Hey Chris,

I was wondering whether you thought it would be better to fly in Thursday evening or Friday morning.  Honestly, either option would work for me I just wasn't sure if Chuck would want to sleep in Friday morning since it's his day off.  Let me know which one sounds better to you.

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Chuck that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Chuck started Air

upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed

Subject:	FERC order denying SPP/Entergy RTO -Summary





FERC Order Issued 3/28/01 Rejecting SPP/Entergy's RTO 

	The Commissioners were generally displeased by SPP and Entergy's lack of substantive work toward complying with the Commission's previous orders and failure to sufficiently discuss the feasibility of a broader RTO.  As Chair Herbert said:  SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).

?	The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.

	o	Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.)
	o	Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP.
	o	MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.

?	Approves Entergy's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Transco and approves Entergy's Board approval process (states that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee's seven members). 

?	Allows Southwestern Public Service Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining SPP instead of MISO.

?	The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******

You still interested in going to the Firehouse on tomorrow night?  I just checked my messages at home and Bryan called last night...at 9:45!  I was already passed out.  I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.  Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.  I talked to Katy last night (before he'd called) and told her about the firehouse...she's definitely interested.  Let me know what you think.

Oh boo-hoo...cry me a river.

Sorry I missed Tuesday, but I went to listen to live music with a friend from UT.  How are things going with you?  I had a great time in London and came back with some Cubans for Dad and a 1920's platinum and diamond watch for myself...can't wait for you to see it.

Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

so...talked to emily last night and here's the deal...

she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in NB tonight....

no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not.....

emily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in NB next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in NB is a definite gathering....

as for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to NB tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck....therefore, if you want to go to NB as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....

either give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...

Hi Julie,

Sorry to be a pest of late.  I was hoping you might have an opportunity to talk this morning.  There are some deadlines I am facing currently that make it that much more beneficial for me to talk to you sooner rather that later.  If you could let me know if there is a time before 10:00 PST that would be a good time to talk I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Hey Sarah,=20

Nice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to Lisa the other day so I g=
ot a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our=
 trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending=
 a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, soun=
ds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over =
the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it ar=
rives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and Mike =
are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.  I wish I was plann=
ing the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have =
you been to Seattle before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend =
from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any ad=
vice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit=
.  Hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together w=
hen you come back to Texas...

Sue

Hi girls!!
Just thought I would send out an email to see how things are going in the
exciting state of Texas!!  I miss it there and I miss y'all as well...I
already sent Emily an email earlier so that is why she is not included in
this...Sorry about the group email but I thought it might be a little easie=
r
considering I would probably be writing the same thing to everyone....Life
is good here in Boulder....Robert and I are trying to make the most out of
our last months here....We absolutely love Boulder...He graduates in
December and I am leaving in August!  I love the summers here, it seems as
though the town empties out when all the college kids leave!  My plans for
the future are slowly coming together...I will be going to Dallas for the
month of August to be with Karin for the birth of the baby!! August is a
huge month for my family....Mike graduates from college (who would have
thought!), Karin has her baby, Mike and I head off to Europe, and my parent=
s
are moving into their new home...Elaina and I's parents are moving into the
same neighborhood only blocks away from eachother...Mike and I are travelin=
g
Europe for a few months together in which I am hoping to meet up with
Emily...We fly into London which gives her no reason not to meet up!!  Afte=
r
that, who knows....maybe Seattle or back to Colorado...we have no idea....I
hope everyone was safe from the flooding recently....I know that Adam's
(Wolters) home was flooded again so I think they are just gonna sell the
house....Elaina- how is married life and school?  Laura- I am so excited
about you wedding plans.  How is that coming?   I hope this email finds
everyone healthy and happy...You all cross my thoughts often...I miss
y'all....Keep in touch!
Love,
Sarah

Hi yourself,

I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.  Anyway, things here are good and I am equally (if not more) excited about my visit.  I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.  Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also make sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming a skirt or dress will work okay? ).

No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple of weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.  Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big deal.

My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40 Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as tired).

Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more than ready for a little R&R.

Love,
Susan

hi susan-

how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a note
before it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a day
off- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed
(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, so
i may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get it
all done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude on
our beach time!

the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming it
will warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitely
bring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....

what are your flight times?

can't wait to see you!
love,
julie

I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or play outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny...he tipped me .50 on 2.50..ha.  The town is loaded with intense
looking film types with their dark rimmed glasses...north face down jackets,
cell phones and ski caps...its pretty funny.  This morning I went for a jog
around down town....I walked down Main st. on my way back and there are all
these people getting photographed along the street...you look at them and
try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like any other guy.
The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out their stories and
photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in this cafe and all are
being used right now..it is crazy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe

no offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect...just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response.

and, though i don't think you intended to, please don't EVER imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid...not in my nature

you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?

Hate to be the party pooper but, based on the events today and this entire week, a shot contest is the last thing on my mind.

Mine is sscott5_2000.  If you go to yahoo's home page you can try to instal=
l it yourself (eek!!!) or use the search on your computer (go to Start..Sea=
rch...For Files or Folders) and type in Yahoo Messenger.  If you still have=
 it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just do=
uble click on it...that should bring it up.

I'm doing alright.  And you hit the nail on the head with the Josh comment.=
...that's exactly what I've been reminded of.  That feeling of uncertainty.=
..loss of youthful bravado, sadness, injured sense of security...all of it.=
  Everyone in the Scott household is fine.  Dad actually flew over NY yeste=
rday morning before the first plane hit.  He was coming from Manchester, NH=
.  He said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over=
 Central Park...no idea how dramatically that skyline would change.  The fi=
rst they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they =
landed in Nashville.  He's still in Nashville right now obviously, but he's=
 okay and that's what's important.  I'm hoping with the limited flights the=
y're allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Houston soon, but it=
 appears the FAA's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back =
home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result.  Chuck and Chris w=
ere supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from Seoul but they too have been =
delayed - indefinitely.  The Army has put a hold on all duty station transf=
ers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving Korea or where exac=
tly Chuck will be going.  The stories and connections of the people on the =
news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening.  A large numbe=
r of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless fri=
ends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.  Chuck has some pledge brothe=
r's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay.=
=20

I wish you were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and=
 on all day yesterday and I must say it would've been nice to been back hom=
e on the couch with her.  I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and =
what was going on there, but she was fine as well.  She said they'd shut do=
wn the airport and several major roads surrounding it, but nothing else of =
concern.

We evacuated the Enron building around 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disc=
oncerting.  I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking gar=
age and had only one desire...to get out of downtown.  There were rumors fl=
ying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building, ou=
r international presence (esp. in regards to oil/natural gas) and our CEO's=
 connections to the President...I think everyone figured Enron would be a l=
ogical target.  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.

On a lighter note...I'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experi=
ence...including the trip there.  Sounds like it was a doozey.

Love ya,
Sue

where are you?  it's been ages since i heard from you- are you ok?  you kno=
w
it makes me nervous when you go AWOL.....matt called this morning and he
sounds really bad.  is doing that oh-so-familiar over-analyzing and
internalizing that would make almost anyone suicidal considering the
situation.  just want to be home so badly.  feel so isolated here.  wish we
were all out on the walker's patio now chatting, and i was with mom and dad
and harls.  i think that's the only place where i'd feel safe and reassured
and as close to happy as i could be right now.  kind of like the way
everyone described josh's funeral.  horrifying, but as good a company to
rebound with as you could find probably.  has been such a long and draining
month emotionally and physically, and am just gutted. hope you're a bit mor=
e
buoyant rt now han i am.  am trying to get home asap, but mom and dad don't
want me to fly.  am not worried about it, and am going to try to get on
first flight possible anyways, so may see y'all soon....pls email and let m=
e
know you're still alive and in proportionally good spirits...

yes...but i've decided my hormones are about the equivalent of a 16 yr. old boy's.  we left about 20 mins after you guys and i drove him to his car.  he asked if i minded him calling to ask me out wednesday or thursday of this week as he is going out of town this weekend  (he said he'd tried earlier this year...to which i responded "yes, and failed miserably")  ...we'll see.  he is a cutie though.  i don't know if you'll ever have a chance to look at the picture of you know who, but physically bryan puts him to shame.

Hey stranger,

Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  

Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Austin this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, Lisa's wedding this weekend and San Diego next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and Doug Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Doug.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hope Law Review isn't wearing you too thin.

I opened up new bank accounts recently and need to set up direct deposit for my pay checks and expense reports.  Could you let me know what all I need to do to have this set up?  I have already filled out the form available on eHRonline.com.  If you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext. 31455 I would appreciate it.

hey there chickie....

it's about 3:00 Houston time and i'm bored out of my mind at the office...no big shock.  i'll be impressed if i make it to 3:30...

so, i was just going to let you know that i'm probably bolting out of here relatively soon.  however, i've found a restaurant that has a little section w/ 2 computers and a couch that i make go crab a cup of coffee at later.  my point being that if you email me back today i probably will have a chance to check it.  

if i don't chat w/ you today, i'm sure we'll touch base at some point tomorrow.  and, on that note i hope things go well tomorrow morning.

talk to you later,
SueBob

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?

The email was titled "nothing bad..." so you wouldn't immediately trash it =
for fear I was dispensing some more of Susan's homespun wisdom.  I know you=
 can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard=
 what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys=
 are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good wor=
k!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just t=
hat no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that=
 would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you=
 that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what =
you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ...=
.." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity=
 - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely lovin=
g it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades g=
o into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my=
 own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job=
 allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Roc=
kets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am o=
ff to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Port=
land.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so =
there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everythin=
g I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so =
witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel..=
.always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itse=
lf for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary =
to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always act=
s on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hea=
ring is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtl=
e but important difference.

Shorty

- You missed an impressive dancing display at Sierra's last night...I think=
 I may have frightened some people.

Tried to call you last night but to no avail.  Know that you were out
having fun.  Mom came to San Diego and we took some pix.  Here are a few.
We called Cris and Chuck and sent them an email with  these pictures.
Love, Dad  There is one of me with the Starship in Wichita and the rest are
on us in San Diego.  We walked over to the Fish Market on the bay and ate
there.  It was really nice. We had a table on the water and had a great
meal.

I've got Deborah Vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go, but I was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe that will work.  I would actually love to skip out on the wedding...however, since the wedding's in Houston and I live here, I don't have a very good excuse do I?

And don't worry...we could wait two years and I'd still want to chat about Vegas.  One of those things you'll never really forget.  I'm sure I sounded funny and I was definitely tired, but in now way were either of these bad things.

Subject:	Re: This Weekend...


Here is my suggestion--

Let's push everything back one week.  My finals are finished Saturday
morning (the 5th), and we could go to Barton Springs immediately afterward,
and eat dinner, and rent a movie, and shop on Sunday, etc.

I am really so behind on my school work that I can't justify taking time off
this weekend.  I would try my hardest, but I just don't think I would be
very much fun.

However, I would love to talk about Vegas.  I've been wondering about it
because I thought you sounded funny.  Maybe you were just tired.

Let me know.

-Corey

I know, I know....I dropped off the face of the earth for a while.  I've actually been in Denver all week for a Natural Gas Convention.  As for Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.  So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what other dates in September look good to you.

Susan

You've got the wrong Susan Scott...you may want to try her married name (which I, unfortunately, don't know).

JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks, 
Jeff

Hey Bonnie,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Subject:	One RTO Entergy to GridSouth

I talked with Rogers, who said that it makes sense for us to advocate one RTO from Entergy through Southern into GridSouth (presumably getting TVA to commit at some point to an RTO).  Florida should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Midwest.  Therefore, the overall theme that Jim discussed this morning (that FERC has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Tom C. is getting the draft of this.)  Thanks.

I've never run that file since it was split out, but my guess is you need to add any prior month adjustments and broker fees to today's file.  Tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month...Errol should be able to help you with that.  Make sure you also follow the Liquidation instructions for the gas daily post-id's...you can find them on that color coded sheet George has.

Swing by if you need anything else.

Susan,

Do you think you could stop by George's desk this afternoon when you
have a free moment. We need a little help as it is end of month!

Thanks,

Thanks Kathy...

Would you mind letting me know when I have access to the curve validation file in the O:// drive, or if there's anything I need to do to secure those rights.  Currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes.  Chance Rabon has said he will do some research and I've contacted some of the traders from the West Desk who were in charge of collecting that information.

Susan

All,

Attached is the preliminary draft of the Natural Gas procedures for Trader actions in populating the template.

Kathy, I'm getting this to you as a heads-up.  There are specific actions the traders need to take in order to populate the templates accurately.  Please share this info. with them; they shouldn't wait on us for the final copy.

I'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but I fear alas my liver would go on strike, and from what I understand the liver is a fairly vital organ...my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last Friday.

Despite all of this I still look forward to engaging in engrossing AND coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight.

Susan

By the way, do we have a particular time in mind?

Well, I feel like I missed out on a lot last Friday, hence the get together tonight.  The plan is the Front Porch right after work for anyone thats interested.  However, come knowing (good or bad) Susan, and most likely Eric, are foregoing a repeat performance. 

So please forward to anyone I have missed and hope to see you there.

Chris and Nick, I know its probably a long shot that the two of you will come, but thought I would try. Its been too long.

Hey Paul,

I'm so glad you emailed.  My parents were just asking me what you were up to this past Sunday...now I'll have something to report to them.  It's good to hear that things are going so well for you and I must say I'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer (I'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are).  

We will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town.  I may be going to Austin for part of the long weekend, but I doubt I'll go before Saturday so Thursday and Friday are definite possibilities.  Happy to hear about your brother and Josh's impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of Paul Thomas.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Work  (713) 853-1455
Home (713) 622-2788
Cell    (713) 775-6472

PS- Alan, you'll have to come out with us now....no more hiding.

Hey Alan, Lisa and Susan,

How are thing going down in Houston?  I hope things
are going great.

I am going to be in town next Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and I was wondering if yall had
time to hang-out?  I haven't seen any of you in a
while and I would love to hear how you are doing.

If you were curious, life is good for me.  This summer
is going to be one of the busiest(and coolest) I have
have ever had.  I am doing alot of stuff I have always
wanted to do(missions trip to Costa Rica, helping
start a small business, best man in my brother
wedding, usher in Josh Williams wedding, etc, etc)!
Next fall I will be going to get my MBA - I am
supposed to decide where I will be going by the end of
the week.....

Anyway, if any of yall have time let me know. I would
love to see you.


Paul Thomas

Hey there,

Have a fun trip to Korea!!

Stephanie and I will absolutely pick you up at the airport on Saturday in
SLC if you decide to come in.  Katy said her flight gets in about 12:00 or
1:00pm, so it is no problem at all.  We are flying Delta #1895 out of IAH
and get in at 4:55 that Friday.  We are staying at the hotel the rehearsal
dinner is at, so we figured we would have time to shower and get ready.  I
was planning on working a 1/2 day that day.  We are leaving early that
Sunday morning, but Katy said she would get her own car that day.

Just let one of us know when you get in if you decide to go...

Talk to you later,
Ashley

See...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.  I'd been planning on going to the Kim Richey concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with Corey, Doug, and yourself if you were interested).  Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.  What are your thoughts?

Ok kids...Lisa has made the excellent suggestion of Black Lab for food and drinks tomorrow.  So how does 6:00-6:30 sound to everyone?

I think this link will take you to the appropriate map...if it doesn't work just go to Houstoncitysearch.com and look up Black Lab...it will take you to a map.

Hey...was wondering if you want to split this month's electricity bill...

Last month was $175.00, this month is $183.00 and we've also started paying for water (which was only about $20 last month).  Anyway, just let me know...I won't make the full check out now if you want to split.

Em,

Glad you had such a good time...sounds like Norm may have even had a little bit of fun?  Anyway, must agree on the ex-fianc? front ( I am understandably nervous about said individual's return to Houston ).  Have to agree on the German beer/food front as well.  I loved everything about that country while I was there, especially the people.  They were all so jolly and round.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Had another pledge sister's wedding this weekend, Deborah Vest, and it was beautiful of course.  Happened to run into Doug George, a.k.a Big Ken, and he said to say, "hello".  He's living in Austin these days and is planning on going to grad school in a year and a half or so (though hasn't applied yet).  He said he saw T.L. recently in Dallas and Taylor has gained about 40 lbs, gone off his rocker, and is dating a girl who used to have purple hair...all sufficiently disturbing news.  Anyway, maybe we'll be able to get in touch with Doug if we end up going to Austin while you're in town.

precious beergardens and fab weather, but am convinced that german beer is
in another stratosphere than coors light et. al......am not sure it can be
duplicated at home.  beautiful countryside- grt food and weather.  the
little cities were straight out of hansel and gretel and the sound of music.
  am still jet lag and confused, but will try to call tomorrow or next day.
think it may be time to totally nip the ex-finace in the bud, or you could
be in for a loooong summer....chat soon-

Hey friend,

I just got your card yesterday in the mail and am so thrilled that you've asked me to be a part of your wedding.  I will try and give you a call later on today or tonight to talk in person, but I wanted to let you know ASAP that I will gladly participate in any way possible in the pre-wedding and wedding day activities.  This really is such an exciting time in your life and I look forward to all of the festivities.

Love,
Sue

PS - Trish Murphy is playing tomorrow night at the Mucky Duck if you have any interest.

Hi Pattie,

I just wanted to make sure that you had a chance to speak with Justin Fernandez.  I thought of him when you mentioned possible candidates for the other open position as he was with our scheduling group and is, I believe, from that area of the country.  If you haven't had the opportunity to establish contact with him please let me know and I will be sure to get each of you the other's contact information.  Hope all is going well with you and I'll talk to you soon.

Thanks,
Susan

Hey Lis,

How's married life treating you these days?  I hope things are good with your job, home, etc.  

I was actually writing you to try and get Bonnie's email address.  My friend Monique and I are going to Seattle next week for a long weekend and I was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner.

Hope to see you soon and please say, "Hi!" to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house.  I'm so sad I'll be missing it, but I'd already booked my flight by the time Clay sent the email.

Love,
Sue

the Cayman Islands

We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.  I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.  Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).  Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick.  

Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.  We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys.

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

Looks like this visit to Seattle is going to be a quick trip this time.  I fly in Sunday (yes, this Sunday) and fly back out after my interview on Monday.  Maybe we could grab dinner Sunday night...that is if you're free of course.  We could even see what Holly's up to.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

It's a very mixed web of information and people...it may take a while, but someone knows where all this information lies.  Ganapathy is a great information source.

Susan,

I contacted Jeremy and Nilay. They did not think that the gas curve relationship data was contained in ERMS, but they referred to me Ganapathy Ramesh who is familiar with RiskTrack. I am waiting for him to return my call.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

RE:	[F8] Misc; comradship


Forwarded by several members:

FYI...  This is an e-mail from an Ensign stationed aboard the USS Winston
Churchill...

Dear Dad,

Well, we are still out at sea, with little direction as to what our next
priority is.  The remainder of our port visits, which were to be centered on
max liberty and goodwill to the United Kingdom, has all but been cancelled.
We have spent every day since the attacks going back and forth within
imaginary boxes drawn in the ocean, standing high-security watches, and
trying to make the best of our time. It hasn't been that fun I must confess,
and to be even more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at the fact that
they either can't be home, or we don't have more direction right now. We
have seen the articles and the photographs, and they are sickening. Being
isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is
happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct
Ship handling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call
from the LUTJENS(D185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the
pier in Plymouth, England. While in port, the WINSTON S CHURCHILL and the
LUTJENS got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made
some pretty good friends.

Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close
up on our port side, to say goodbye.  We prepared to render them honors on
the bridge wing, and the Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them
farewell.  As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer announced
through her binoculars that they were flying an American flag.  As they came
even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was
crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to
Port- the ship came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the
German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues.  They had made up
a sign that was displayed on the side that read "We Stand By You".

Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed
alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes.  It was probably the
most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us
fought to retain our composure.  It was a beautiful day outside today. We
are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecured e-mail our location, but
we could not have asked for a finer day at sea.  The German Navy did an
incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in
the days since the attacks.  It's amazing to think that only a half-century
ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being
demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be
out here doing our job.  After the ship pulled away and we prepared to begin
our man overboard drills the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said, "I'm
staying Navy."

I'll write you when I know more about when I'll be home, but for now, this
is probably the best news that I could send you.

Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)

Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or 
a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light 
misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. 
Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.

Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.

Time: 90 minutes


Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - 
are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute 
message that completes the treatment.

Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.

Time: 90 minutes

Ta Ta,
Susan

Had a bit of an encounter with Ted last night.  Turns out it wasn't as bad =

The email was titled "nothing bad..." so you wouldn't immediately trash it =
for fear I was dispensing some more of Susan's homespun wisdom.  I know you=
 can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard=
 what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys=
 are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good wor=
k!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just t=
hat no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that=
 would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you=
 that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what =
you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ...=
.." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity=
 - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely lovin=
g it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades g=
o into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my=
 own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job=
 allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Roc=
kets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am o=
ff to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Port=
land.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so =
there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everythin=
g I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so =
witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel..=
.always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itse=
lf for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary =
to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always act=
s on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hea=
ring is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtl=
e but important difference.

Shorty

- You missed an impressive dancing display at Sierra's last night...I think=
 I may have frightened some people.

 the email and how is trading going?  Also, I appreciate your candor last n=

joefreid: There is a new MBA guy doing a rotation in Trading, his name is Edmund Gaither...have you met him?  Very large, strong looking guy
joefreid: infectious laugh
joefreid: I went to Tuck with him
TXsscott5: no....do you know what trading group?
joefreid: I'll ask him when i can get him on the phone again.  Monique's name was familiar...I think he just started in whatever group he is in
TXsscott5: hm....but he's on the gas floor?
joefreid: I think...but not sure, will find out
TXsscott5: ok...i can probably track him down....
TXsscott5: mo thinks i was a search dog in a former life
joefreid: haha
joefreid: are you one of those people that can find anything on the internet in less than 2 minutes?
TXsscott5: y
TXsscott5: :-)
TXsscott5: had a huge debate at work yesterday
TXsscott5: is there such a thing as too much water....for consumption purposes
TXsscott5: i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good, old-fashioned water
joefreid: personally? or from a macroeconomic sense (property rights in the West, blah, blah, blah
TXsscott5: personally, as in water in-take into the human body
TXsscott5: and there is such a thing....and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication...
TXsscott5: it's so gratifying to be right ;
TXsscott5: ;-)
joefreid: yes, I buy into the law of diminishing returns.  I've heard of water intoxication and I agree with your assessment
joefreid: that doesn't mean you are right
joefreid: though
TXsscott5: why not?
joefreid: my bad...because you found info on Water Intoxification you are right.  I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right
TXsscott5: oh...ha
TXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, "no amount of water can be bad for you" etc. etc.
TXsscott5: and i replied, "at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload"
joefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: thx
TXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know
TXsscott5: now
joefreid: Cow them into submission
TXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, "you're intimidating" more than once in my lifetime
TXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me
joefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation
joefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: so true
TXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer
joefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok?
joefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity?
TXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead
joefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the "wing" provides lift.  The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that?
TXsscott5: that one still gets me
TXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that
TXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne
TXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective
joefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle
joefreid: ?
TXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major
TXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you 
TXsscott5: ;(
TXsscott5: :-(
joefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this "lifts" the wing.  But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc...
TXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS
joefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce.  Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it.
joefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me
TXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion

Ok...The flight option I've selected on Continental arrives at 5:17 pm Thursday and departs at 12:58 on Monday.  I haven't actually purchased the ticket yet, so if you want to get back to me to suggest anything else for some reason please don't hesitate.  However, if I haven't heard from you in the next hour or so I'll probably assume that the times are okay and just go ahead with the purchase.

Kevin,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  After speaking with everyone Thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with Cinergy right now.  It was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims.  To that end, let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process.  As I expressed to you at lunch, my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader.  I left the offices Thursday with the impression that Cinergy, and those with whom I interviewed, could help me to accomplish those objectives.  Good luck with the many tasks ahead and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thank you,
Susan

He was over again last night.  Please explain to me why you would invite your "man" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.  I simply do not understand.  I took full advantage of the fact Ted lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.  Where's the fun in that?  I just think it's weird.

Talk to you later,
Sue

Just got your email...I'll take a look at it after morning trading.  It does sound like it would be fun.

What happened to you last night?  I was starting to get worried about you.  Also, we have one of our Taster's dinners Thursday night and both Katy and I are planning on going.  Any interest?

I just got a call from Susan Ginsberg at El Paso.  It seems they have heard from FERC staff that INGAA is showing up an awful lot to talk about the marketing affiliate rule and why there should not be any changes, but they wonder why, if they really are separate companies, the affiliates have not been in to talk to FERC themselves.  I think we have already heard this message, but El Paso wants to set up a group to go into FERC.  THey are setting up a conference call for next Thur with some other companies to discuss this issue.  I told them we would be in on the call (we don't have to, tho) but that we may not want to go into FERC with that group.  

Would anyone like to be on the call next week, or have any problem with my participation in the call?  Shall we talk about going to FERC to give them our position?  (or should we just tell them to read our comments)

IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT! 

[IMAGE]
Well, it is and that  means you and me. I'm supposed to send this to
[IMAGE]
FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.
[IMAGE]
The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
[IMAGE]
Today they weigh 23%  less.
[IMAGE]
~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.
[IMAGE]
An English professor  wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: "Woman,  without her man, is nothing." 
The women wrote: "Woman! Without her, man is  nothing." 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  
***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in 
celebration of Women's History Month. 
If  you do, something good will happen.... YOU will boost another 
woman's  self-esteem!

Hey girls, 

Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

P.S.  Katy...my friend Julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com.  I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions.

I actually think we have the Monday off (Sept. 3).  So, ideally I'd fly in Friday evening and fly out Monday afternoon.  I'll email more later, but just thought I'd give you a heads up.

hi susan-  sorry i missed your call on sunday!  i was totally hung over and
lying on the beach, and my cell phone doesn't always get reception
there.  labor day definitely works for me- call me if you want to today to
discuss, or we can email and work everything out that way.  i have no plans
as of now, so whatever works for you, works for me!  i can take off friday,
if necessary, or you can fly in friday afternoon or friday evening and we
can have all day friday, saturday, and most of sunday.

hope you had a fun weekend- can't wait to see you again!

FYI:  Bryan called last night to see if I wanted to go out again.  I think we'll probably end up going out on Thursday...I don't know.  We'll see how it goes, but I don't feel as excited or enthusiastic as I probably should.

Hey Corey,

I'm thinking about driving to Austin this weekend to see Kathy & Travis's new house as well as the two of them and the kids.  Just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together.  I know you still have to work at the Law Review, but I figure you won't be there 24 hrs. a day...course I could be wrong.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

I just realized that I hadn't emailed you yet...shame on me.

Em and I (yes, it was just the two of us in NB...oh the shame) tried to call you on New Year's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room and I assume were staying with Priyah (I know I butchered that) whose last name I do not know.  Anyway, I did talk to your Mom the day you arrived in Madras and knew you were there safe and sound w/ a new friend too boot!

Hope you're doing okay and starting to adjust to the new surroundings.  Email me when you get a chance and let me know all about your trip.

Good Luck and talk to you soon,
Sue

Hey folks,

It's harassment time.  I'm trying to put together the contact list to end all contact lists.  I was hoping you guys could help me out by filling in any of the info you may already have.  I've attached an excel file which has plants, pipelines and storage facilities.  Fill in whatever you can and feel free to add anything you think should be included.  Just take a look at the sheet when you get a chance and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for all the help,
Susan

that sounds good...don't push yourself to do too much, you need to take it as easy as you can until all of your internships start this summer because you know they're going to be tiring.  plus, you'll be busy introducing me to all of the cute single guys you'll be working with...talk about exhausting!  i'll either chat with you tonight or tomorrow and we can figure out what, if anything, we want to do.  personally, just going a having a good meal coupled with good conversation sounds great to me - nothing big.

If anything changes, I will let you know.  Otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow.

I would definitely be up for tonight and a walk sounds great.  I just need to swing by the grocery store and the dry cleaners after work, so 6'ish is probably best for me.  Let me know if that works for you and also where you'd like to meet/walk.  Lisa, if there's a good place around your duplex I'd love to come see it and show you the pictures I took from your wedding...there's a great one of you and Brad dancing at the reception.  Anyway, drop me a line and we'll figure out when and where to meet.

Sorry we didn't get much of a chance to chat last night, but I hope you had fun at steak night.  It's too bad you didn't make it to Sierra's ( you could have seen a true dancing display by yours truly).

So.....

I'm doing my post New Year's check to see when and if you want another visitor.  As I told you before, I am COMPLETELY flexible in regards to this weekend vs. some other time (and actually, I'm probably more flexible than just the weekend...things are still dead around here).  You just have to tell me yeah or neah.  I feel like you might need to share a good bottle of wine with a good friend and just release.  

Let me know how your schedule is looking and whether you're up to hosting one more visitor to your fair city.

Subject:	Jennifer's Shower - RSVP

Hi Everyone,

Some of you might be aware that we are planning a Bridal Shower for Jennifer
Bowles on Nov 3rd. Invitations have not yet been sent out so don't be
alarmed if you haven't received one.

The shower will be between the hours of 7-9 (maybe 9:30 p.m.) What we were
thinking about doing afterwards is going to the Mucky Duck and catching
Jimmy LaFave, who is performing at 10 p.m. He is one of Jennifer's favorites
and we thought it would be a nice surprise.

What I need is to know is who all would be interested in going to the show?
Tickets are $15 and we need to get them ASAP. It will probably last until
midnight.

If everyone could please email me back and let me know if you are interested
in going, that would be great.

Please don't mention this to Jennifer, we want to keep it a surprise.

Thank You,
Sarah

Well...when i was there you liquated the P&L post-id everyday, so unless that's changed you will continue to do that everyday.  For the last day of the month you will also want to liquidate the Official post-id as well.  Look at the file I've attached and it will explain how to handle the Gas Daily book this month since the last day of the month is not a week day.  The notes are in blue.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

 

Susan

Hi, Susan:

You look quite different now after leaving Risk for four months because a trader's life is less stressful than that of a book administrator (kidding!). 

A question.  I forgot which liquidation number should we use for Gas Daily P&L: P&L post ID or Official Position Post ID.  Could you recall for me?

Wish you all the best!

Subject:=0912th Friday State of the Union

Well its been a very long time.  A lot has transpired since my last ever-po=
pular Friday State of the Union.  As usual my friends and I have been up to=
 no good and, fortunately for you, I am ready and willing to tell you all a=
bout it. There are so many people and things to talk about and only one Sta=
te of the Union to cover it all.  This could be a very rough ride so, as al=
ways, Brace Yourself!!!

Multiple choice question:  Which one of the these airport names does not be=
long? A) Reagan International Airport  B) Bush Intercontinental Airport C) =
JFK Airport D) Louis Armstrong National Airport.  Well in case you are stum=
ped, here is a little hint: think "Satchmo."  Chris Coulon (my political in=
sider) told me that the city of New Orleans had narrowed it down to two cho=
ices: Edwin Edwards National Airport or Louis Armstrong National Airport.  =
Well it was a close race but considering Edwin Edwards was convicted last y=
ear of numerous counts of bribery and extortion; the City of New Orleans de=
cided on Louis Armstrong.  So now every time you fly into "Satchmo" make su=
re you high-five a friend as you pass that beautiful picture of Chris Owens=
 and her 60-year old breasts because you are now in New Orleans, a place wh=
ere absolutely nothing gets taken serious.

Speaking of New Orleans, has anyone read the book Confederacy of Dunces?  N=
ow that he lives in the French Quarter, Granola Centola truly personifies t=
he book's main character, Ignatius Reilly.  Just last weekend, while walkin=
g back to his apartment from Cat's Meow, Larry felt the need to relieve him=
self next to a neighbor's car(what a way to build neighborhood friendships!=
).  While in "mid-stream," Larry got picked up by a policeman and dragged o=
ff to the Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) for indecent exposure and public drun=
kenness.  When I asked Larry what it was like to spend the night in the "Bl=
ack Bar Hotel" his response was, "It wasn't that bad I talked politics the =
whole night with my cell-mates," and he added, "the best thing was that the=
y (cell-mates) were all Democrats.  Can you believe it?"  Yes, Larry, we ca=
n believe that all your cell-mates were Democrats.=20

Well if you haven't already heard Shawn (The Wop) has moved back into Beau =
Chene College Apartments.  This move has made Shawn a target for jokes amon=
gst most of our friends.  Thankfully, Shawn takes these comments with a gra=
in of salt and even recently commented to me that "I (Shawn) love living in=
 Beau Chene, especially since I have been included in Jeff Jordan's (Landlo=
rd's) Monday Night Football parties."  Shawn says there is only two require=
ments to get into this party: 1) you must be a guy and 2) you must B.Y.O.C =
(Bring Your Own Cold Cuts).  Shawn says that no one seems to like his ham o=
r turkey and that for some reason there tends to be an enormous amount of S=
alami at these parties.  Shawn says it never fails, whenever Jeff introduce=
s him as an old FIJI  to someone at the party, the first question is always=
 "Do you know Nick Nesbit and the Turner Twins?" and the second question is=
 "Do you like Salami?"  Word to the wise, Shawn, you might want to rethink =
the meaning of the "C" part  in B.Y.O.C.

While most of Houston wants the 2012 Summer Olympics in Houston so they can=
 watch the events, the girl I went on a date with a few weeks ago wants it =
to come here so she can compete in the Track and Field Events.  Now I am no=
t insecure about my manliness, nor do I consider myself out of shape, but a=
fter having dinner with the "she hulk" I felt pretty damn wimpy.  Thankfull=
y, I had my good buddy Lenhart to pick me up from my deep depression.  We w=
ent out the following Thursday night to Houston's Latest Hot Spot, TACO MIL=
AGRO.  Since Matt had  a very bad case of Laryngitis, we worked as a team; =
I talked to all of the girls and Matt just stood there and smiled.  Oddly e=
nough, we got a ton of girls' phone numbers.  Matt couldn't understand it a=
nd even boasted about it the next day, "I (Matt) was on fire last night.  I=
 didn't even say one word the whole night and for some reason I got more ph=
one numbers than ever before!"  Overhearing our conversation, Tim (Paw-Paw)=
 Blanchard chimed in, "It is not a coincidence, dude."

Speaking of Paw-Paw, next Friday Night is Tim's Bachelor Party in Baton Rou=
ge.  As most of you already know, Tim does not have a spontaneous bone in h=
is body, so he took the liberty of e-mailing us his itinerary (See Below!) =
for next Friday night's "Festivities."=20

1) 7:37 PM - Kiss Louise goodbye.
2) 8:43 PM - Drink 2.32 beers with everyone at the Sheraton Hotel in Downto=
wn Baton Rouge.
3)10:26 PM - Drink 3.7 beers at the Gold Club and tell Landry how I (Tim) a=
m not like Lenhart "I (Tim) don't like to get drunk and pick up chicks whil=
e hanging out at the Club." (Note: In case you guys forgot Tim used to be a=
 real partier.  That's how he got the name Paw-Paw...)
4)11:47 PM - Watch Larry pass out at Fred's while dancing to Blind Melon as=
 he proceeds to get into fight with the bouncer.
5)12:56 AM  -  Do one shot with friends and throw the other two shots on th=
e ground when no one else is looking. (Note:  I've actually busted Tim usin=
g this tactic on several occasions)
6) 1:50 AM -  Request "Son of a Preacher Man" at Fred's and look for the cl=
osest Phi-Mu to slow dance with to the song.
7) 2:39 AM -  Bail-out a half drunk Granola Centola from Jail and when he w=
alks out say, "Larry, what the f-ck!?!"
8) 3:27 AM - Kiss Louise good night and dream about the Tigers kicking the =
hell out of Auburn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everyone have a Good Weekend!

GEAUX TIGERS!

I will be staying at the office later than I initially anticipated this evening.  If either of you are able to talk simply let me know the time and I will give you a call.

Hi John,

I've been trying to get a hold of Julie this morning, but am not certain if
she is in the office today.  My current situation has become somewhat
interesting over the last several days and I was hoping to be able to talk
over some things with her.  If Julie is in fact out of the office today
would you mind if we talked at some point.  I'm under some deadlines around
here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things
with Julie or yourself.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

I forgot Leigh Ann was going to be in town this weekend.  As for this evening, I think we're still on.  The movie is showing at the Angelika at 7:40 or Greenway 3 at 10:00...I'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie, but there is something to be said for proximity.  What are your thoughts?  We could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards.  My guess is Emily would probably prefer the earlier time, since she may be taking off early tomorrow.

yeah, i talked to katy last night and really, really want to go. i think that sounds awesome. however, my friend leigh ann is coming into town on friday. i was thinking of asking her to do that instead, but shes not only coming to see me but others as well. so i am probably out unless she cancels her trip here. thanks for trying to accomodate me with a ride though. 

are we still on for tonight?

Stopped by Em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Austin this weekend.  She'd already talked to Katy and it sounded like Katy was interested in Austin tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Emily and Katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.

Hey Corey,

Was wondering if you and Doug still had any interest in the Concert Sat. night.  Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).  The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.  Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...

Did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets?  As for dinner, I just emailed Katy and asked for her preference.  I think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards...say 8:30ish, but before would work for me too.  I haven't talked to my Mom yet about the tickets, but I'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here.

Talk to you later,
Sue

Sue,

I called and we are set for tomorrow night.  Are we going to try to dinner before, after or middle depending on how exciting it it? Were you able to find out the specifics on the airline tickets?  Transferring the tickets to my name, etc?

Just curious.  We can talk about it tonight.

Hey guys,

Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life.  If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days.  I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous).  I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea.  

As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston.  I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough.  The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays.  Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat.  It was a completely surreal experience.  Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.

Speaking of the new job, things are going well.  I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come.  There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US.  I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade.  So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in Houston and take on this role.

I had a pledge sister's wedding in San Antonio a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another "sister's" wedding this weekend here in Houston.  I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements.  Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends.  I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front.  Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself.  I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then.  Okay, change of subject...getting to deep.

Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas.  We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun.  Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun.  I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am.  I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there.  I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover.  I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good.

What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.  And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.  September is also an option if that works better for you.  I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.  Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.

Hope the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon,
Sue

I've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.  We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.  Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back Emily Party"?  If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.  Hope the paper(s) is/are going well.

Talk to you soon,

PS - I'm in Seattle this weekend, so I'll miss the friend.

breezy- and no rain to speak of.  sorry- had to rub it in a little.
anyways, got an email from marci's LA friend that i met while he was
visiting in london.  he is a producer working for animal planet doing
documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to london.  now he's
coming to houston this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and
emailed me to let me know, since he's "helping" dad find the ultimate female
GSP.  so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that
you could show him the houston ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names
and phone #s.  kates- you already know jim from LA, and maybe marce has
already given him your #.  am not sure.  but anyways, he is really nice,
easy to talk to (even for moi, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night
out.  just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named jim casey
called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little
hostesses!

Attached please find comments on the Illinois Energy Workshop.  I have reviewed Pam Stroebel's comments which were basically in support of the development of more generation .  She commented that Illinois' reserve margins are adequate over the next few years.  Interestingly, she claims that Com Ed has one of the largest curtailable programs in the country.  She has industrial customers representing 1200 Mw of Capacity under contract.

I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phon=
e.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continen=
tal is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to=
 H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each ot=
her!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics defini=
tely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the Enr=
on people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I fig=
ure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll j=
ust get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape=
 to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's goi=
ng to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip afte=
r you have a chance to look...Lisa and I have both been to Salzburg, but I =
don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and =
there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.

Ciao,
Sue

ok- we lose.  didn't know what to do- she was like a little terrier chewing
on my sock and would not let go.  she insisted on waking you up and MAKING
OUR PLANS!  yippee.  ok- am going to try to be upbeat.  haven't actually
traveled with lisa, maybe is not bad.  but will say this:  am NOT blowing m=
y
stock $ savings from last 7 yrs to be bullied into shitty vacation.  i gues=
s
she's staying w/ me- funny, she never asked.  assumed that it was ok to put
potentially 5 people into 300 sq. foot flat.  sorry- don't want to get
huffy, but was really looking forward to this, and you KNOW if the shoe was
on the other foot and she had another A&M friend coming to visit and then i
tried to descend, it would not be a warm welcome.  am imagining YOUR living
room, minus matt, ......in london.  ok, done.  will try to look up more
stuff on italy tomorrow, but honestly don't care- would just like to go
somewhere pretty and not big-city-like where there are not too many sight
seeing opportunities i will feel obligated to participate in.  maybe
dividing room rate by 3 will allow for a fancy-schmancy hotel
room....positive thoughts, positive thoughts...try to call/email later.

TOBIN!!!!!......i was deceased, but i have arisen from the ashes....HOW ARE YOU?

I want to hear all about the UK and how you are fairing there.  If i can manage, it I'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad, etc.  Sorry you never managed to meet up with emily, but she was actually in the US when you emailed and then only back in London for about a week to pack up and head home.  So you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when...(i.e. UK vs. US for holidays and what not).

If you have a Messenger account let me know...i'd love to chat "real-time" with you.

Susan

BTW:  I'll be in Portland mid-November for work...if you happen to be home then, I'd love to see you...otherwise, any suggestions would be much welcomed.

Are you still alive? What's the word? England is grand, though I am gone so
much I wouldn't really know what's going on here...
Drop a note as you have time. I tried to contact Emily but alas she has not
returned my call, must be quite busy she is!
Let me know if we have a connection.....

Next week sounds good to me too.  If everyone wants to meet at Ale house for a drink today why don't we try right after work.  Susan had a very big night last night and needs to be in bed early tonight as a result.

I can't wait to hear about the honeymoon either!!!!

Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, "Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like." And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. "You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?"

The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it
again?"
"Oh, yes!" the female statue said. "But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!"

Hi Chris,

I just wanted to follow up with you and see if you had a chance to look over my resume.  I realize I may not be exactly the candidate you had in mind when you first spoke with Larry, but I would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss any opportunities you may have available at this point.  As Larry can attest to, I've had responsibilities at Enron that span from back office to trading.  To that extent, I believe I could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

So if I can get tickets (actual seats...not standing room only) are you game for tonight?  The concert starts about 8:30 so I figure we would try to get there early enough to get decent seats and possibly eat.  Let me know.

Sue

Sorry no call last night...I passed out cold when I got home.  Also, I'm dying to hear about the Jonatha Brooks concert.  I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.  I was really wanting to see Kim Richey...I'm wearing a hole in my CD.

Subject:	WEST DESKS--FERC authorizes power marketers to purchase from industrials (and more)

On March 14, 01, FERC issued an "Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West.."  (Docket No. EL01-47).

	Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01.  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials).  (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that request by mid-May.)

In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates.

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
	 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale.
	-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports.
	-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff -- must file a rate schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and authorizations.
	-- This authorization expires after 12/31/01.
Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at market-based rates.  These transactions can occur in several ways:  An aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load under retail choice programs.  In addition, wholesale and retail load with contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of power is greater than the value of consumption.  Similar quarterly reports would be due by EPMI/EES.
NOTE:  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) 
Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is wheeled away from the industrial.

Other initiatives in the order:

Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers.  FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are required to be filed at FERC.
Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities.
Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM.
Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service by July 1 (and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02).
Considers "rolled in" rates for generation interconnection (rather than direct assignment that we have now.)
Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency standards for QFs.  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California and the WSCC.
FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection requests, etc.)
Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review.

Please let me know if you would like the order.  Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this.  Thanks.

great ideas and suggestions!  i'll respond in more detail later, but wanted=
 to let you know you picked some of the best restaurants in san diego!  i'l=
l try to gather some people to go straight out on thursday evening- that wo=
uld be fun....i was going to study on saturday, but may have to rethink tha=
t if you've found saturday to be better beach weather.  i do like your plan=
 for friday...i've asked my rooomate for spa suggestions....the one i do kn=
ow of is L'Auberge resort in del mar- you can probably find info on the web=
 and/or call them (don't have the phone number handy, unfortunately!).  i d=
efinitely think a jacket is better than a sweater- unfortunately it's quite=
 cold today.  does usually warm up during the day, though.   do you like ba=
seball?  i might be responsible for hosting our skybox on saturday, so we c=
ould drop by for a few innings, but if not, then i can get someone else to =
be in charge.....i am taking monday off of work to study all day, so it sho=
uld make me much more relaxed this weekend. and i'm going to study like cra=
zy tonight. =20

there are several churches near me, so we'll probably go in del mar, cardif=
f-by-the-sea, or encinitas.....still working that out. but definitely plan =
on a run on the beach (if that appeals to you!)- i've been so horrible abou=
t working out these past several weeks. =20

since san diego is pretty casual, you should be able to bring a pair of bla=
ck pants or a skirt or something and have it function for both dinner out a=
nd church.....and of course, i always have sweaters and jackets, so you can=
 always borrow something of mine. =20

i'll drop you more info once i have it!

At 11:49 AM 4/10/2001 -0500, you wrote:
Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to
put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging in
the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I
think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various
situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance,
am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do
you suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear
anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation (=20
figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in
the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)
Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we
should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.
As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with
a few suggestions... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa,
Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of
Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into
consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an
option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement
both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above,
in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill,
also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and
your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight
from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what
time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out
Thursday night.

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help
out with a few suggestions.

Love,
Susan

Hi Mrs. Barker,

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party Saturday (Lisa and I only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting Emily in London).  I had actually already purchased concert tickets for Saturday night, but am currently seeing if I can find anyone willing to buy them from me.  If I am successful in pawning these things off I will be present and accounted for to help Kelly and the gang celebrate.  I will be sure to take your number home with me and give you a call tomorrow to let you know my status either way.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

Adriane,

Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly) and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will be able to stick to the new limit.

Thanks again,
Susan

Have to agree with your assessment.  And, I promise she will try like the d=
ickens to do stuff with Niklaus (sp?) maybe at the expense of doing things =
with you.  Mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.  He ca=
me over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.  Me in a wing-back and Lis=
a and Mitch holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.  This is the se=
cond time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had =
to witness the "cuddle fest."  Not to mention the "cuddle fest" we all witn=
essed with Chad at Europa.  Maybe if she does come over you could be the li=
ttle red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force =
her to make some sort of decision about all these guys.  She's in heat righ=
t now I swear.  Every 5 sec. there's some new guy she thinks is hot.  The g=
uy serving us at Jason's Deli might be the next victim.  She's totally out =
of control.  I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik prob=
ably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.  It's really pitiful=
 you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.  Did I =
mention that Laura White's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Mitch=
 and I at Kenneally's b/c I was spending more time with him than Lisa (she =
was of course performing the role of social butterfly).  Like I said, it's =
pitiful.  In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her "friends" that have=
 met Mitch and think he's all right  I'm pretty sure everyone else has told=
 her they think she can do better.  I beg to differ, knowing Lisa a little =
better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that =
he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually but not perceived (at l=
east by her) as a complete push-over.  Perfect combo for our Ms. Gillette.

Can you believe my parents?  They were only in San Diego for all of 12 hrs =
and took a roll of film...what dorks.

Sue

I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me.

   hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
   message and ill call you back.

   very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

   oh, where are you staying?

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
have
   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan

Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

For future reference I would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone (713-775-6472) instead of the apartment phone.  Lisa ALWAYS answers that phone...in fact, she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there (who on earth would be calling me?).

We'll keep working on the "trip".  I'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor.

Sue

Lisa, I dont have a lot of time, but I'm glad you emailed me, I was planning 
on call you soon to talk to you about this.  You CANNOT go to India.  I'm 
being completely serious.  You know how in favor I was of your trip, but in 
light of recent events and the responses that they will soon yield, you must 
cancel your plans.  I'm being very serious, it will not be safe for you to 
be there at all.  I really hope you take my advice.  Believe me--I know 
about these things.  We'll talk soon.

thought you'd get a kick out of reading this...start from the bottom up.  (you'll have to click on the web link to see the e-card i sent ted for his b-day)  as monique comically pointed out this morning, "bet you never thought somebody would make ted look good?"  in the land of disappointing men, it's all a matter of degrees.

No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

Thanks for note shorty.  I hope all is well in gas trading land.  I will be joining the weather derivatives desk asap as the ag effort has been shelved.  But, this afforded me the opportunity to take a vacation last week which was cool (again the charmed life of Ted Noble).  I would like to hear about your time as a trader and I have a good book for you to read about interviews with the world's top commodity traders.

Hi Herb,

Tim Bowler had actually given me your name and email address a little while back and thought it would be a good idea for me to drop you a line.  I have been working with Tim for a couple weeks at Enron and, upon learning that I was in the midst of job hunting, he suggested I contact you.  For the last year I served as an assistant trader on the West Natural Gas Desk (Wholesale).  For various reasons I chose to decline an offer in February with the newly formed UBSW Energy and am currently still working for Enron.  I'm attaching a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my background and experience.  If you know of any opportunities that seem like possible "good fits" I would very much appreciate hearing about them.

 

Thank you,
Susan Scott

Bobby/Matt,

I spoke with Mike yesterday and he filled me in on his correspondence with both of you.  I appreciate your assistance in identifying potential opportunities for me in Portland.  

John and I are planning a relocation in the near future and I have always had an interest in the Portland office.  Still, this is a fairly involved decision for us and at present we are discussing a number of  options.  Therefore, while I am preparing my resume to forward to your HR rep, I would appreciate it if you could hold off on speaking with Tim for a few days.  That should give me enough time to work through a few of the options with John.  Thanks again for your help.

Mo.

well girls,

i didn't end up getting the job with Puget.  i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience.  he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept, which is why they were waiting to get back to me.  i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the VP i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer.  unfortunately for me, his answer was, "yes".  

anyway, while that opportunity is no longer...i have still decided to decline my offer with UBS to join the reformed trading organization down here.  on that front, i am still very interested in trying to get up to seattle and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters.  let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into.

thanks guys,
susan

FERC has approved FE's modifications to its market based tariff (MBT) to accomodate the provision of 1120 MW of MSG with the following changes:

1.  On the subject of billing, FERC noted that it could see no reason why the MSG customers should be treated differently than the MRT customers who recieve a bill on the 5th of the month for the previous month's usage and must pay by the 19th, giveing customers 14 days.  Thus, FE waasordered to change the billing timetable to be consistent with the MRT.  This gives us more time to make payment.

2.  FE is required to submit rate schedules which it had failed to do, covering, Service Schedules A &B, Application for Service, Form of Service Agreement, Form of Certificate of Concurrence, Saummary of Transmission and Ancilliary Service Charges and Code of Conduct.

Also in the order was a discussion of assignability since Shell argued that  MSG should be assignable from one marketer to another or to an aggregator.  FERC said that since Sec. 18.01 of the MRT provides that a customer can assign its rights and obligations with the written consent of FE which consent can not be unreasonably withheld, assignment is allowed.  

I am faxing a copy of this to Nicole and Gloria for our Houston files, should anyone want to read the order.

Hi Pete,

Would you mind shooting me back an email to let me know if I have the right address.  Brad McKay had actually given me your new work number, but unfortunately you were off the desk when I tried to call a few minutes ago.  Not too long after you departed, I too ultimately chose to decline joining UBS and am currently in the midst of researching new opportunities, interviewing, etc.  On that front, I was hoping to pick your brain a bit about a few things.  

Thanks,
Susan

I'm sure she knows you're CC'd her on the email...she wants you to witness the flirtation.  She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.  I told her I sent it to him.  She said, "I didn't think you knew his last name?"  To which I responded, "I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.  I'd promised him at Kenneally's that  I'd send it when I got the chance."

Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.  I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.  Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the "let's just be friends talk" last week ( which I think was the right move ).  

Glad you got some good sleep last night, but we need to chat when you get the chance (and not while I'm at work), so give me a call on the cell phone sometime.  Nothing bad, just a good little story.

Hi Ivonne,

I opened up new bank accounts recently and need to set up direct deposit for my pay checks and expense reports.  Could you let me know what all I need to do to have this set up?  I have already filled out the form available on eHRonline.com.  If you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext. 31455 I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

we should definitely get together. so when are yall coming? where are
you staying? i have a lot of suggestions, as i have done the whole
touristy thing here in seattle when i first moved here.

i am betting you are staying downtown or near downtown which is
perfect/. and getting around seattle is easy- you can either take bus,
or if you dont feel like it, you can always take cabs as they are
readily available in the downtown area.

you must see pike place market--- its downtown on the waterfront, where
they have fresh fish, etc/ very neat/

then there is the experience music project, an awesome museum -
literally like nothing you have ever seen before. very interesting.

for outdoor stuff, i would say Discovery Park, which is about a 15
minute drive from downtown.  it is beautiful.

write me and let me know when you and your co worker are coming (as in,
what weekend)--- i hope it is a weekend that i am planning to be here! i
would love to meet up.

let me know
bonnie

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

Hey,

I may swing by the Tasters dinner just to say, "Hi" to everyone and then meet you at the Forest Club.  What do you think of that?  Also, Katy and I may go to Blanco's later if you and Leslie have any interest.

So I've decided I will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys.  I'm sick of these crappy ones.

I think Aries is the one- event though it is $$$.
Since Ashlea went to Fox Diner last week and only said
good as a comment, then I say we go for it and try
Aries.  7pm on Thursday it is if everyone else agrees.
 I'll send the e-vite after I get a few approvals.

Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.  I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.  I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).  I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right?  

The trip was incredible.  My life has done an absolute about face.  Can't wait to tell you all about it.

Talk to you later, 
Susan

THANK YOU... BIG for making maps... that will be wonderful!

The luncheon is at 12:30 and how long does it take to get to S.A.?  Should
we leave by 8:00 or 8:30????  I don't even know what I'm wearing yet.....

Check out  the Southwest website if you get a chance...it's got all the data.  I'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go, so I may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package.  That way I can spend more on food and drinks.  We can definitely look into a mother/daughter trip.

It all sounds pretty good, but is there any way to get on an earlier flight Sunday?  Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but if I could get into Houston closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be a better for me.  I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse comes to worse, I'll just deal with the jet lag.

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.

Subject:	ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

i'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.

you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

look at you...such a hoax spreader...ha

anyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything about it anyway. so no harm, no foul.  how are you doing?  as for Enron, as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.

can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the wedding and the move.  btw, have you set a firm date yet?

talk to you soon,
Susan

you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?

No offense :-)

Hi George

You will want to liquidate the June Exotic Options today (using the valuation spreadsheet- Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls) as well as update the Option P&L file to account for the June Exotic option's value you calculate.  You will actually roll-over the Options P&L tomorrow, after you finalize the 31st's P&L (the final P&L file will include any Prior Month Adjustments as well as broker fees).  

You will update the Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls when the actual published indexes come out...so that will most likely be Monday.  At that point you can send the file to Beatrice Reyna in it's final version.

If you have any other questions just come by and get me and we'll go over them.

Susan

Hi, Susan:

How is everything?  What do you suggest I do to become a trader? ...?  ...?   
The last question is when should I liquidate Jun Exotic Option and update Option P&L file.

Thank you very much! Talk to you later.

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and Jessica and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Millie?

We tried so hard to make things better for our kids
that we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down clothes and
homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I
really would. I hope you learn humility by being
humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being
cheated. I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow
the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody
gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It
will be good if at least one time you can see puppies
born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a
black eye fighting for something you believe in, I
hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line
down the middle of the room, but when he wants to
crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I
hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and
your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll
let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can
do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two
blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone
as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope
your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying
one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you
also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope
you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your
mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you
hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen
flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I
hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your
friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch
with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May
you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the
holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you
throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and
that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These
things I wish for you through tough times and
disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its
the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of
your friends who mean the most to you. We secure our
friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.

Julie,

I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.

I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  

Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

my god, she's like that nagging cough in november that you just can't seem
to shake! know we must be sensitive for obvious reasons, but haven't played
all our cards-yet, je pense.  i think it's best you mention the fact that
she may want to ASK me if she can come.....tell her that you, katy AND kelly
have done so already, and bethlehem is FULL rt now.  no room in the inn.
which means, seriously, she may need to research alternative places to stay.
  really don't want to be a bitch, but honestly, it's my vacation too, and
as i said- love hosting, but not when it becomes uncomfortable.  will be
glad to treat her like a princess if she can come another time and give me a
heads-up.  i'm really sorry, but honest to god, things are getting out of
hand.  may also want to mention the weekend plans to go to the eagles
concert, which will be an all day affair (told all the gang to come at noon
and we'd drink margs and go to the pub all day before the concert)- i know
if you don't get tickets, you'll be ok, but lis can't go to the BATHROOM
alone....aughhhhh!  ok- off to dinner.  just saw the mandolin movie.  bad
news bears.  not on my recommendation list.  chat later-

Thanks for the info...I will check into it.  Hope you manage to get some rest.  The wedding was fun, super sweet and huge (800+ at the reception).  I got hit on by a waiter at the rehearsal dinner and groped in the hotel elevator by one of the groomsmen...so I'm up on guys right now.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue

definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.  He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).  I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could.

I'm sure you don't want me to remind you in detail of your own birthday experience?  Europa, the shrubs across the street?...and it wasn't 2 hours, more like an hour to an hour and a half.  Besides, I think Bass spent a little more time than myself praying to the porcelain god (at least I had the good sense to just pass out when I got home).

Hey,

The trip to Nashville was good...Chuck and Chris actually live in Clarksville (which is about 45 mins NW of Nashville).  We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.  Chuck drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.  We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the Maxwell Coffee fortune.  Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.  They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.

I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.  In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.  At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.

We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).  I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.

Hope things are still going well there!

Keep me posted,
Sue

Hey Lis....

As always it's good to hear from you.  I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).  Please tell Priya, "Congratulations!!!!" for me...that is awesome.  I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc.  I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).  You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!  And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.  If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be "it", it can just be fun).

I have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.  So things are definitely happening.  I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).  

Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.  Chris went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.  She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.  They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes Chuck and Chris told the doctors to let her go.  Her name was Kelly Elizabeth Scott.  My Mom and Chris's Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.  Chris is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.  So say a little prayer for them if you can.

I miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.  Take care and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

I had some appetizers the other day at the MFA that were provided by Aries and they were very good.  Definitely wouldn't mind trying that place.

unfortunate...but you also don't want to go getting yourself attached to someone whom you ultimately don't have enough in common with to sustain the kind of relationship you're looking for.

off the soapbox....

i'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.

hey...

i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning...i figured you'd already done yours.  i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night.  i can fill it out monday, but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job.

the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday.  so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key.  on the bright side, i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent (which means we're cool rent wise, i.e. you needn't give me any $ for january).  

i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning...i'm nervous and excited.  i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself.  i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview.  also, i'm going to see "kiss me kate" the musical w/ my friend up there so that should be fun.

i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there, you sound awfully busy.  keep us posted on all your many activities.  

Sue

Julie,

I just wanted to write and thank you again for affording me the opportunity to visit with you and all the other members of the  Puget trading team.  It was unfortunate we were unable to meet again before my departure so that I could have expressed the above in person, but email will have to suffice.  I very much enjoyed meeting with John, Mark, Dana and yourself, as well as with the other members of the gas and power staff.  You have a unique operation and one which appears to have many untapped opportunities that will undoubtedly make your time with the company fairly interesting for the foreseeable future.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to speaking with you again in the future.

I went ahead and mailed all of my travel information, including receipts, to Jaquelyn Lewis as see was mentioned as the travel contact in one of your previous emails.  If there are any other measures I need to take on that front please let me know.

My previous difficulties with my other email service have been resolved.  Therefore, all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address.  In light of this, I simply ask that you direct any future email correspondence to: 

susan_m_scott@hotmail.com 

Once again thank you,
Susan Scott

I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.  What pray tell will she do?  With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Mitch not to shack?  I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.  She keeps looking for signs to know whether Mitch is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.  She's got such a tough life.  

Oh, my Mom was over Sunday and made some comment about Lisa always dating someone....she still denies.  Cracks me up.  Response is always,  "I've only had two serious boyfriends."  To which I've started to respond, "We'll I'm batting zero and have only one legitimate first date with a guy.  In relative terms, you are a dating phenomenon."

I definitely need this vacation,
Sue

Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.

hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.  when
i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have info
on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to try
seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
helpful

i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
weekend unfortunately....

i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
do!

the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle you
never know.

my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night- believe
me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could
get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday.
the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime
on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
message and ill call you back.

very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

oh, where are you staying?

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

When you get a chance, tell me again what your schedule is for the end of April through July.  I'm trying to figure when I can come visit and not pay too much on airfare, be able to stay a decent amount of time and not miss critical days at work.

I will definitely come over...just don't know if it'll will be when Katy does.

Hi DeShonda,

I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't heard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.

Thanks,

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

This article's pretty good and it does mention India in some context, so I thought you might be interested.  The India comment is several paragraphs in to the article.

Hello Susan -

This is Bobby here at Enron. I work in retail power in EES.

We met  ages ago here in Houston.
I started working here at Enron a month ago.

I work on 6 but make it to 31 and 32 from time to time to talk to people there.

Hope things are good on your end.

Bobby

ps. If you see Joel Bennett around, tell him I said hi. (I can't remember which floor he's on.)

My mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.  I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.  Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.  Just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news (and doctor prodding)...we'll grab a margarita next week sometime.

Sent:	Wednesday, September 19, 2001 8:12 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Hope you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to Austin this weekend.  Emily, Katy, myself and possibly Lisa are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.  We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if Doug wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.  Also, one of Katy's friends manages Pat Green and he's playing at Gruene Hall so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.  Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.

Hi Wei, 

The PWC guys said that 1:30 would be fine.  I have also asked them to email Chris and Bjorn with their requests.  If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.  What is your location again?

Thanks,

Susan,

I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?

Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Chris Constantine and our main business user Bjorn Hagelmann to outline what the request is.

Subject:	more seattle advice

hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.  when
i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have info
on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to try
seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
helpful

i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
weekend unfortunately....

i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
do!

the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle you
never know.

my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night- believe
me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could
get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday.
the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime
on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
message and ill call you back.

very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

oh, where are you staying?
bonnie

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

I heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w/ the military workouts....

As for me, the trip was fantastic.  Mucho shopping and even more eating.  Not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go.  The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.  It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.  I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.  It has a definite Austin vibe.  The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.  Oh well,  I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.

Bonnie....How was the weekend??????  Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Whistler.  

So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.  I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.  I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.  

Hope all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Btw...messengered with Matt yesterday, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.

Suzanne,

The flights sound great timing-wise and I know exactly where that hotel is located...being within walking distance of Pike's Market is always a bonus.  I look forward to the visit as well as the opportunity to finally meet everyone I've spoken with in person.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott

Hi Susan -
Feb 7 Thursday - your air reservations are on Continental Flight 367 - coach Lv. Houston/Intcon 2:35 p.m. nonstop, ar. Seattle 5:17 p.m.

February 11 - Continental #423 coach nonstop. lv. Seattle 11:50 a.m., ar. Houston/Intcon 5:57 p.m.

I will not be mailing you tickets.  You will be using Record Locater VT8YST.

I made hotel reservations for you (see attached).  This hotel is between Cascade Natural Gas and downtown Seattle.  Because there are 4 conventions in Seattle this weekend and the annual Northwest Garden &
Flower Show, hotel accommodations were slim.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Have a great day.

Sunil,

I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).

I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.

Susan

Laura and Ed--
Attached are EES comments on the Illinois Commerce Commission inquiry into the possibility of establishing some additional requirements on retail suppliers that serve both residential and industrial customers (EPMI and EES are both ARES).  I think the comments are fine and promote a market based approach that focuses on real customer protection issues.  Gloria will keep you both informed of further developments by the ICC.

Jim, 
The Illinois Commerce Commission has initiated an inquiry into the activities of agents in the Illinois electric market with a view to organizing follow up workshops or rulemakings to regulate some aspects of agency activities. Their definition of agent includes power marketers, aggregators and resellers. I have filed Enron comments in this proceeding, which as the below e-mail suggests may set the tone of the proceedings. I am forwarding this to you to ascertain if there is ENA interest in monitoring this proceedings, and who will be the appropriate ENA party to update. I attach herewith, a copy of the comments. 
 

Thanks,
Gloria

Subject:=09RE: PNR questions


Mike,

I see in your emails below that you are indicating that the allocation proc=
ess does not comply with the tariff. The allocation process I do not think =
is the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the =
only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari=
ff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t=
he range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that =
way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation=
 process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it=
 looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates ar=
e found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that T=
W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra=
tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis & load the total specific contract=
 deal rate in CBS.  Please let me know if there are other problems in the a=
llocation process itself.

Thanks Ramona

Regarding my meeting invitation..............I hope this helps.

I've had a series of e-mails with Marketing, Legal and Regulatory regarding=
 TW PNR in an effort to finalize the process and procedures. As a result, I=
've learned that TW's allocation process does not comply with the tariff. (=
See below) Marketing wants to continue with current practices, but changes =

Mike,

I recommend that we continue to use the current practices we are using now =
of charging the PNR rate posted on the day service begins.  I also recommen=

d posted rates for PNR service.   In the future, we may choose to change th=

Subject:=09PNR questions

Sue & Kevin,

I need some help from you..............
Based on the response from Susan Scott and Glen Hass (below),=20

Should TW continue the practice of charging the PNR rate posted on the day =
service begins or charge the rate posted daily? (Using the latter, TW's pos=
ted rates would include the text Susan provides below)
 =20
Should TW continue to use the nomination process and posted rates for PNR s=
ervice or revert back to entering into individual purchase orders for each =
deal?
The individual purchase orders are not as convenient , but they provide bet=
ter clarity between the parties.

TW's allocation program uses the posted and/or deal rates entered into CBS =
when capacity is allocated. It  does not calculate ..."the greatest total c=
ost commitment". System modifications are needed to determine which shipper=
 has the greatest cost commitment.  =20

Subject:=09PNR questions

You asked:

=091.  For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it accepta=
ble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should=
 TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance?

=09Answer:  The tariff doesn't say.  I believe this is a business decision.=
  Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK wi=
th taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?  My understa=
nding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s=
ame day.  I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a con=
tract or other writing, we rely on our posting.  If we change our practice =
and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at =
a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.  From a legal standpoi=
nt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-=
mail or other writing.  While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says=
 the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), document=
ation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises.

=09Another thing:  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers =
the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and ot=
her shippers the posted rate from day to day.  However, there can be no dis=
crepancy among similarly situated shippers.  To avoid the appearance of dis=
crimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is fea=
sible from a business standpoint. =20

=09Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, =
here are my recommendations:

=09My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be =
something to this effect:  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B=
E CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.  (If this looks =
awkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.)

=09I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.  However, if it is possible=
 to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:  The rate applicable to Contract No=
. ______ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate=
 posted on Transwestern's website for that day.  Another option might be ju=
st to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it wo=
uld not have to be done for each deal.

2.  If we have the following situation:  Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth fo=
r a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we c=
an only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth -- who gets prior=

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?

I think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.  If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.  Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out. Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.

I'm still thinking about it.  I have had a bad week-- very stressful-- and last night I was mad at the dogs for barking so I banged on the window and put my hand right through it.  Surprisingly I was not cut very badly.  I think I need to relax a little.
I want to go, but I am just giving myself an out because I sort of feel like curling up in my bed with a tub of ice cream and a movie.  Actually, I felt that way more last night, but I gained perspective after putting hy hand through the window-- and after realizing that today is my last day here and everything will be finished for better or worse before I leave.
Count me in for now.  I will call you tonight.  Tell me your cell phone number again-- (775-6427?).  Doug just got one-- his number is 512-796-2320.

Lexi,

I would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.  My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.  Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule.

Thanks,
Susan

I'm metal 
& I am steel
I don't mind
cause I can't feel a thing
I'm a diamond ring

I'm not flesh 
& I'm not bone
I'm not sad & I'm
not all alone
I'm a stone

the king is dead
and the queen has flown
left me here in the
twilight zone - 
lost and looking for
a way to get back home

and there's no right
and there's no wrong
so I'll be good 
and I'll be strong

I'll be silver &
I'll be gold
without a heart
without even a soul
I'll be coal

I won't be blood &
teeth and skin & 
I won't feel the 
pain I'm in 
I'll be tin 
with no heart within

the king is dead
and the queen has flown
left me here in the
twilight zone - 
lost and looking for
a way to get back home

and there's no right
and there's no wrong
so I'll be good 
and I'll be strong

Lisa, I dont have a lot of time, but I'm glad you emailed me, I was planning 
on call you soon to talk to you about this.  You CANNOT go to India.  I'm 
being completely serious.  You know how in favor I was of your trip, but in 
light of recent events and the responses that they will soon yield, you must 
cancel your plans.  I'm being very serious, it will not be safe for you to 
be there at all.  I really hope you take my advice.  Believe me--I know 
about these things.  We'll talk soon.

Last night was good...a nice, relaxed dinner suited me just right.  As for a rematch, we'll see...I've got dinner with Monique and Jennifer (you met her downtown once I think) tonight.  So maybe Thursday or Friday night we could do something.  I'll give you a call later.

Hi Susan!  Thanks for the info.  Sounds great to me.  We'll coordinate later.  If you get a chance, send me Julie's e-mail.  Is that her name?  I guess I deleted it from my e-mails.  Give me a call this week if you're planning on a re-match with Bronwyn ("Birdee").  A beer and a chat would be great.  Hope you have a great day at work and I'll talk to you later.

Hey...

so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision, and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive.  Frank told me this was a "good thing" for me and that he was jealous.  And Steve actually said he was proud of me.  anyway, it's gone much better than i had expected.  still don't know exactly what happens to me now.  so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store.  

i'm still checking into lodging etc. for this weekend/early next week.  i can fly in saturday or sunday, but maybe sunday morning would be best.  i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days (plus, i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday).  then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday....just a thought, feel free to share you own.

drop me a line when you get a chance,
SueBob....finally living up the name!

You are absolutely the BEST Tobin...

I think I'm flying back up to Seattle next weekend to have a second-round interview with Cascade.  However, I must admit I'm intrigued by you and your father's very diverse connections in that area of the country.  Hope you are doing well and that Merry Old England is treating you properly.  

No rush on getting back to me, I just wanted to make sure you received the email and had whatever answers I had to give.

BTW....I'm celebrating my first quarter century today!  Quite a milestone in one's life.  I have to love that I'm essentially unemployed and living with my parents.  Big pat on the back for that one. Ha.

Ciao,
Susan

Question:  Do you think you will return to the PNW when you finish with school...we hadn't really talked about your future plans and my curiosity is peaked.

Yup...I leave for the Caymans today.  Our flight out is at 1:45, so we'll probably be leaving the office around 11:45 this morning.  I am, understandably, very excited.  

We will definitely talk more about Tuesday night either Sunday or Monday.  As for Civil War, I'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets.  The going away party for Kenny should be really fun, I'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly.

Have a good weekend and I'll be sure to take lots of pictures.

See ya next week,
Susan

No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

Thanks for note shorty.  I hope all is well in gas trading land.  I will be joining the weather derivatives desk asap as the ag effort has been shelved.  But, this afforded me the opportunity to take a vacation last week which was cool (again the charmed life of Ted Noble).  I would like to hear about your time as a trader and I have a good book for you to read about interviews with the world's top commodity traders.

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.  You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up kayaking.  Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.  It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We also hit "the Bite" which was really neat.

Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

   hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
   message and ill call you back.

   very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

   oh, where are you staying?

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
have
   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan

Could you shoot me an email when you get a chance...I was hoping to ask you a few questions about the west curves that Keith Holst was in charge of collecting.

Thanks,

1:30pm sounds fine. Where do you sit? 

Also, just to confirm, we are looking for:
1. Table/list of gas curves and their primary, secondary and parent relationships;  
2. Volatility curve table/list for gas; methodology for system calculation of correlation
3. Volumetric poistion data by curve for gas as of 11/30/01 

Thanks,
Mike

Susan,

I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?

Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Chris Constantine and our main business user Bjorn Hagelmann to outline what the request is.

Thanks,

Wei

Man, what a deliciously relaxing vacation!  Little green monster be gone...
What are you off to this week?  Truly Miss Jet-set.

The weekend of the 12th sounds great!  Talk to the bunch tonight and see if
you can scare up a crowd.  :)  It'd be so much fun to see you again!

Hey there,

Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the
frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks
for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in
Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend
of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get
together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was
awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could
just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh
yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a
bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have
to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!

Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you
tonight.

Sue

I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So...

Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will
be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that
Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you
want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his
boss,
so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out.

However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next
two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours.
Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time.
And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate
to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is
really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend?

Stopped by Em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Austin this weekend.  She'd already talked to Katy and it sounded like Katy was interested in Austin tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Emily and Katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.

Hey Paul,

Jay's already left for the day so you'll probably have to get with him first thing tomorrow morning to get his bid.  I'll be sure to let him know about the deal if he calls to check in today or first thing tomorrow morning if I don't talk to him before then.  

Thanks,
Susan

oh im SOOO glad the weather was good.

i am not disappointed that you didnt go kayaking- are you kidding? ive
been here 6 months and havent done it yet!
so glad yall liked the market and "the bite"...

i think the seattle market is so neat. some of those people travel 2
hours every day to get to seattle to sell their fruits, flowers, etc.
alot of them are asian immigrants just trying to "make it" in america-
all the "stalls" where they sell fish, etc are great small business
success stories. that's why i like supporting it...

take care

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.
You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up
kayaking.
Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.
It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and
Vancouver.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of
time
outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled
shrimp
there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We
also
hit "the Bite" which was really neat.

Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me
know
the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

      hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
   when
      i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might
have
   info
      on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want
to
   try
      seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good
and
      helpful

      i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for
the
      weekend unfortunately....

      i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday
morning,
      and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
      night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want
to
      do!

      the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
   you
      never know.

      my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket
for
      sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
   believe
      me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
   could
      get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

      ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
      definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
   friday.
      the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
   anytime
      on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
      message and ill call you back.

      very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday
hopefully.

      oh, where are you staying?

      Hi Bonnie,

      How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
   have
      been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
   riding
      public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
   have
      some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in
Seattle.
   One
      of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long
weekend
   in
      your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope
you're
      still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It
looks
      like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good
thing
      for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
      offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
   live
      in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit
of
   a
      research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
   for
      restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great,
and
      maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a
drink.

      Thanks a bunch,
      Susan

Paul,

Got your message last night and since both nights work for Lisa and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky Alan.  

So Alan, it's all up to you...will it be Thursday or Friday?  If you're looking for a preference from Lisa or myself I think we would both be leaning more towards Thursday.  So just shoot us all back an email and let us know when.

Can't wait to catch up with you Paul.

See ya this week,
Susan

Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Houston the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.

Thanks, But No Thanks: Turning Down the Offer
by Carole Martin
	[IMAGE]	
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	
	[IMAGE]	

In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, "Thanks, but no thanks."
Great News; You've Got an Offer
George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?
It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.
How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?
Do What You Want
The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. "Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do," was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.
When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. "Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable," she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.
Making the Call
The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. "I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position," he told the manager. "I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future." The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.
It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.

I may cruise over to this place later with my work friend Monique...would you have any interest in going?  Regardless, I'd still like to get together for dinner or a drink after work.  Drop me a line and let me know if you're still up for doing something.

Dan Electro's Guitar Bar 
The bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years. 

Bar/Club Profile	
The Scene
The bar's large courtyard, canopied entirely by trees, makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on Houston's sultry summer nights. 

The Sound
Patrons ("real nice folks") can settle in among the guitars with $2 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music, from blues to alternative country, rock to folk. 

Electro-fying Blues
Thursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 10 years and shows no signs of letting up, especially since it draws the likes of Greg Allman and Richard Gere. If you're really lucky, you might even catch Jim, the owner, wailing away onstage on one of his own Danelectro guitars.

Trading'em up old chap....Jay was out Friday, yesterday and is still out today so the eastern rockies are all under my command.  It's been a bit on the chaotic side the last two days so I've really just been trying to maintain sanity.  As always, it is a pleasure to hear from you and I would love to gather sometime and flex the brain muscle on something other than bid/offer and spreads.

Ciao,
Susan

No LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.  Friday may a happy hour option though.

Sue

This is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me... so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home?

Paul's deal with Petrogulf is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

Thanks Theresa.

Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.

Hey Matt,

Just thought I'd let you know that I'm thinking about heading to New Braunfels tonight to see Emily.  We were wondering if you might want to get together tonight...we've missed you terribly.  You can shoot me and email back or just call Emily at the river house (830 -964-2494) or me on my cell phone after 4:00 (713-775-6472).

Hey Kasey,

I just got an email back from KJ and he seemed to think you're going to be in San Diego until Saturday or Sunday of this week...so, I thought I'd drop you a line and let you know I too will be in San Diego.  I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon.  If you have any free time give me a call on my cell phone, 713-775-6472, and we can try to get together.  I've got your number from your last visit to Houston so don't be suprised if you hear from me.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

Marion,

I apologize for not returning your call last night.  I was out to dinner when you rang and by the time I returned home it seemed too late to call back.  You should be able to reach me today without any problems.  If you would like, you could also just shoot me an email with a time you would prefer to talk and I could phone you.

Thanks,
Susan

Sounds perfect....  I'm also being a wimp about driving home tonight because
I've been feeling like I am about to get sick for three days. Someone told
me the mold count was high, which would explain it.

Leslie is moving to Houston tomorrow.  She is living at the Extended Stay
America near you.  (So is Joe.)  I will tell her to give you a call-- she
will be working at the DA's office.  Lots of single guys with social
consciences who know that money isn't everything....

Just heard from the Earl...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.  I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point.  

As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to Sierra's.  Needless to say it was a big night.  

Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have "get-up-and-go" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by).

I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.  Besides, Dean's is the ex's favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.  I'm sure after this response Ben will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case.

Cheers

I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on...

Oh I am so glad to hear from you! How are things? Been thinking about you---no not in that way. :)
No, actually, Daniel and I got back around 9:30 and I went into Farrago's to see if you were there....but you weren't. I looked like death warmed over after the game...it has been way too long since my playing days. To be true, I have the get-up-and-go, but I literally whiffed a few kicks...
Thankfully, Daniel played well. He had one pitch that was sweet!!
What are you up to this week? I am trying to get Ben to go with me to Dean's on Thursday. I love that place on Thursdays....wait, I digress...I like the ladies on Thursdays there. Want to go?
Let me know what the Earl says...I am a little disappointed in him as of late...not that he cares.....

Hi John,

I've been trying to get a hold of Julie this morning, but am not certain if she is in the office today.  My current situation has become somewhat interesting over the last several days and I was hoping to be able to talk over some things with her.  If Julie is in fact out of the office today would you mind if we talked at some point.  I'm under some deadlines around here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things with Julie or yourself.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

If you have time at some point today could you stop by my desk. We had
some problems running that GDOPT & SwapAvg Report file last week.


Cheers,

Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  

Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  

I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow?  I am coming in town tomorrow, but I

Hey Lisa,

Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.  Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable).

As for the "Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls", I would like to put my order in for a Turkey Breast sandwich on white.  I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here?

Love ya,
Susan

PS - I've mailed the receipt for your nightie so you should get it by Saturday...sorry it took me so long.

Girls-

Hopefully you got your itinerary in the mail.  Please email me first, if
you did not get it and second, what your order is from Zito's.  The menu
should be in there.

Thanks!
It's really coming up!!!

Love you!

thought you'd find this interesting.....

chrysalis (KRIS-uh-lis) noun, plural chrysalises or chrysalides (kri-SAL-i-deez)

   A pupa of a moth or butterfly, enclosed in a cocoon.

[From Latin chrysallis, from Greek.]

   "The climax of metamorphosis into an adult can be viewed almost daily.
   Butterflies usually emerge from their chrysalises sometime between 9:30
   a.m. and 11:30 a.m."

I'm sure it is...I'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as I get them.  However, I will warn you that I'm on vacation from the 14th-26th of August.  I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in S. Korea so it should be interesting.  Anyway, you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person.

Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI.  This details out verious aspects of the Texas retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Texas market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for EPMI to enter the Texas Retail market by January 1, 2002.  
	1)  Complete ERCOT LSE application
	2)  Review market requirements
	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
		Delivery Service Agreement
		Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Authorization
		Electronic Data Exchange Trading Partner Agreement

Please feel free to contact me at 712-366-3399 or page me at 888-912-1426, if you have any questions or if I can be of assistance in getting EPMI in the Texas Retail Market.

1)  Need to complete the ERCOT LSE application, copy attached.  ERCOT Contact for assistance:  Karen Berman 512-248-3171

3)  I have attached a copy of a Texas Market Analysis that I prepared for EES.  The general rules are identical for each TDSP service territory.  This provides details of the implementation requirements.
 << File: AEP - Texas Executive Market Summary.doc >> 
4)  EDI Implementation Guides (Version 1.4) to support the Texas Market Opening January 1, 2002, have just been released.  This Version will be the basis for Flight 1001 testing.  Additional information including scenario maps, change control process, etc., can be found at http://www.ercot.com/Tac/RetailISOAdHocCommittee/Customer/SET/keydocs/Keydocs.htm.

 << File: Version1.4.zip >> 
5)  There is a detailed EDI testing plan in place for Texas.  This testing process is administered by the Independent Third Party Testing Administrator (ITPTA).  The website where all of this information can be reviewed is http://itpta.intellimark-it.com/.  Attached is the Testing Signoff Worksheet that must be completed prior to beginning the testing process.  Tentative key testing dates for Flight 1001 (the last testing flight for January 1, 2002 market opening) are:
	August 30th		Mandatory Market Orientation for Trading Partners

back to reality with a vengeance, sometimes reality is no fun...I think the weekend in NB will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy.  I'm guessing I'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the Fabulous Satellite Lounge (I hate having a conscience!)  .

no contact with the guy...although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding...regardless, though it may not sound like it, i haven't been too focused on the situation.  on a another "playing with fire" note, went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch (the old boss) and ended up eating dinner with him as well.  he paid (although he tricked me into letting him, said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away...needless to say he didn't expense it).  we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt, but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons.

i'll see you when you get home.

Hey Holly,

I wanted to thank you for including Bonnie and myself Saturday night...we both had a great time.  It actually meant a lot to me to have such a fun evening w/ almost total strangers, makes the prospect of moving up there a little less daunting.  You have a nice group of friends, and I will definitely draw on both yours and their expertise on where to live, etc. should I end up moving.  Hopefully I will know some more in a week or so...and when I do I will definitely give you a shout and let you know how things are playing out.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

hey-got your message this morning- was out and about w/ nikki when you
called.  haven't been plugging the phone in lately b/c is not easy to get a
line out to the states still.  no planes to us still this morning, and of
course dad had to send one of his melodramatic doom and gloom emails about
me NOT coming, but am honestly not worried about it.  he's freaking out.
have my fingers crossed that maybe will make it out tomorrow....not much to
report around here- just kind of wandering in a fog, you know?  no longer
absolutely miserable, just numb.  ok- prob about to go back to sleep- had to
wake up at 5 this morn to see if BA was flying out this morning...to no
avail.  chat soon-
e

Cindy,

Sorry no response from me, I've been out of the country.  Being a novice, I forgot to look at the clock exactly when I crossed.  I know it was 30 mins and some odd seconds, so my best guess is 30.10 minutes  Hope this helps.
