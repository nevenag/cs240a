I sent you a letter today  To summarize I asked Lou Alexander to prepare an evaluation of the accounts at Morgan Stanley  I did not get the information I needed so I sent the securities off to be valued by a company that will turn it around in 5 days  Once I have the stock info I can complete the return- without the expenses unless I get them from you before then  We can deduct on the return any expenses you paid on behalf of your mother from date of death to present including federal and state income taxes  Send me a complete list as soon as possible  We can extend the return and pay an estimated amount of tax with the extension  I would prefer not to extend the return if possible because it is so close to being complete The VA attorney told me that the consents need to be notarized  I have re-sent them to everyone requesting that signatures be notarized  I dont know why he couldnt let me know that sooner Ellen -----Original Message-----From ElizabethSagerenroncom

Subject        Fwd Afghani-American writer Tamim Ansary Hi guys This is really good My friend Anjali sent this to me and well its worth reading I wish you all the best Have a good week -Bridget I thought this was a very thought-provoking piece Anjali   The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary  Tamim is an Afghani-American writer  He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life  When he writes I read  When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in -Gary T          Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do  Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for 35 years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan  Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan  The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997 Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan  When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps   Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are 500000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy no food There are millions of widows  And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves  The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets  These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done  Eradicate their hospitals Done  Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care  Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs  Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around  Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed  Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout  Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this  Read his speeches and statements Its all right there  He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers  If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view  Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary Descargue GRATUITAMENTE MSN Explorer en httpexplorermsnesintlasp

E Taylor Mark  Briggs Tom Long Chris Butts Bob Zipper Andy Subject09Re Draft Responses to FERC Staff Question109In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm ent or management would you please provide an explanation to the following   We understand that EOL requires that a counter party before accessing E OL to do business with Enron North America must undergo a credit worthines s evaluation   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price EOL doe s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction However Enron may not only buy from a counter party it may sell  What so rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util izing EOL to purchase from Enron Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p arty credit risk that Enron uses  If yes may we have copies  If Enron ut ilizes its own agreements please provide us with a copy All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct ed over the phone or through EnronOnline  Enron as the principal to all p urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t elephone or in writing requires counterparties to be creditworthy  In add ition Enrons risk management process is required to be approved by the En ron Board of Directors according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company  Enrons risk policies are provided in Enrons pu blicly available 10-Q audited financial statements filed on a  quarterly and annual basis with the SEC  Enron maintains a separate risk m anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron  trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies   This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C hairman of Enron Corp and has the authority to instruct the suspension of  transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded  In a ddition every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the y can transact through EnronOnline  The Credit Risk Management group appro ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em bedded within the EnronOnline database    Every transaction is passed thro ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterpartys bid or o ffer via EnronOnline such credit checks are done automatically and there i s no human intervention  As with all Enron transactions the credit limit  checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually   EnronOnl ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit  limits or breach credit limits  No further transactions are executed unles s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such that credit limit is still available EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters  into whether we are buying or selling  The transactions entered into on E nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter ms and Conditions which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity these are all available on the web-site  A Master Agreement i s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro nOnline  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline  transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count erparty chooses to accept or not online should the counterparty not want t o accept to language in the contract for credit or other reasons the Hel pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them Question 2    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system  However does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled   If yes does EOL col lect use or manage data regarding cookies It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system  It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customers mouse is 20 EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled 20 Question 309Also why doesnt EOL publish a ticker of completed trades  showing prices and quantities  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data  If yes when There are now several options for viewing historical pricingtransaction da ta from EnronOnline  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin e httpaboutreuterscomenrononlinequotes which also provides custom ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which  they acquire access  In addition EnronOnline provides a number of online  charts for products which graphically depict historical transaction prices   Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also all ows for administrative users thereby allowing the back offices of counterp arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li ne with their own systems Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices For e xample Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas  Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place this will commen ce on July 1 2001  At the end of each day EnronOnline makes available t o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day s transactions  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index Question 4 09In addition how does the data collection from EOLEnron Net works flow to the risk management groups  How is the information used EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen ding on the type of commodity transacted  For example the group that hand les US gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi an Power  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office  utilizing a bridge  a process that is capable of communicating transacti on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates The potenti al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom er with more efficient recording of the transaction The back office system s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions  such as invoicing preparation of financial statements risk management and credit  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all sources including EnronOnline the telephone other trading systems etc Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re gulatory rules regardless of the source of the transaction The Enron commercial employee who is offering to buy or to sell through En ronOnline does so through a price management software application this no tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed  The counterparty  the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi ed by the system at the same time 20 The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as information is used from any transaction completed by Enron When a transa ction is completed EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system  Enron  Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems  It does howeve r automate our deal capture system which improves the data feeds to our s ettlement and credit systems Question 509Also we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained  by EOL  If yes in what form and for how long EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database  The tra nsactions are bridged duplicated onto the various systems databases m anaging the underlying commodity the risk system associated with the commo dity  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos t a transaction completing for example deliveries finishing and this is  policy across all databases In general EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free real-time pricing information for approximately 1800 products for 13 comm odities including electricity and natural gas  EnronOnline utilizes e-com merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t ook place on the telephone and by fax   EnronOnline is a proprietary or  one-to-many trading platform On a one-to-many platform one entity suc h as Enron is the principal to every trade unlike a broker type platfor m 20 EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t he second  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both  the sell price and the buy price  For example on the telephone a buyer p reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month s but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices some prices cou ld have changed  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the bid and off er prices all the time to make more informed decisions The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight as follows   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC has enforc ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot ential manipulation  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale  20 The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over financially settled derivatives swaps and options  Moreover pursuant t o the Commodity Exchange Act CEA Enron can only trade derivatives with counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules  Suc h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract  Participants ECPsgenerally corporations partnerships and other entit ies that meet net worth or asset tests 20 EnronOnline is a proprietary bilateral trading platform on which Enron is  a principal to every trade  As such EnronOnline is not a trading facilit y as defined under the CFMA  As a proprietary platform EnronOnline uses  Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro n and its customers 20 From09Lisa YohoENRON on 06222001 1214 PM To09Steven J KeanNAEnronEnron Richard ShapiroNAEnronEnron Linda R obertsonNAEnronENRON Sarah

MalowneyEnronEnronXGate  Subject XOM09 Alas no agreement to execute at this point  We have come a long way howe ver and only 2 serious issues remain open  All the others are at least m ostly resolved -- see my 5101 revision w marginal notes made during my 5 201 meeting w them  This file is in my office with all the others XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions both of which  are problematic for Enron 1  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is designed to assure XOMs compliance w the US federal governments requi rements imposed on all government contractors  There are 2 categories of r equirements  environmental laws compliance and small business participatio n in federal govt purchases of goods and services  Since XOM has adoped a  General Commercial Plan to comply with such requirements XOM has promise d the US govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions  And  thats what the auditors from the US government would be looking to ascer tain in a review of XOMs compliance  As for Enron we do engage in busine ss w the US govt but we have not adopted a General Commercial Plan s o we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis  Taking the last para graph of this Supplement as an example addressing the use of women and min ority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under this con tract at this point Enron isnt really prepared to undertake such things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enrons abilit y to comply  Ive communicated w Michelle Cash George Wasaff and Cathy  Riley at Calvin Eakins direction on this topic and I asked Cathy Riley t o have her director Calvin Eakins phone me to discuss this further but h e did not call  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to this   XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec 1013 based on my 510 1 draft to add a final sentence The Federal Contract Supplement is attach ed as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to the e xtent appplicable  This certainly takes care of all of XOMs concerns bu t Im not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be  See for e xample Dave Nutts markup of the environmental provisions in the file a nd Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small busi ness requirements  We might be able to get some outside expertise on this  or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it 2  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials etc for bot h parties  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resultin g from the gross negligence andor willful misconduct attributable to its  managerial and senior supervisory personnel  You can see the full details of the provisions theyre looking for in the XOM language in sec 104 sam e draft the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last rou nd and which we generally dont mind giving them  But this impacts Article 7 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver applies to indemnities and of course XOM will not tolerate any exceptio ns to the liability of each party yes its mutual for the gross negligen ce of its managers etc  Theres a true story behind all this that dates b ack to the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline RFG  Mobi l hired a lab to do the testing the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing staff to fudge the results tons of RFG hit the market that  was not in compliance and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dolla rs lost were the result  And the contract provided that the labs damages  were limited to the testing fees and apparently that worked for the lab c ompany  So its a deal breaker for XOM  bc they say that if Enrons mana gers decide to turn off the lights at all the refineries for some specious  reason they need to have proper recourse against Enron   Ive argued wit h them about this based on the nature of this contract the power trading  business etc but to no avail   It would seem that Enrons language i n Art 7 w the following rather narrow change might work for both partie s but its up to you now 09UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONS EQUENTIAL INCIDENTAL PUNITIVE EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES LOST PROFIT S OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES BY STATUTE IN TORT OR CONTRACT  UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided however that nothing  in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Partys liability un der Article 104b 20 Let me know if you have any questions about this 20 Regards Janice EB3811 Assistant General Counsel Enron North America Corp 713-853-1794 Fax  713-646-3490

Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contr acts One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se rvices EWS manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights  This is par ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com modity lines including gas power coal steel pulp and paper each of wh ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty  This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat ed entities to trade the various commodities  Absent express contractual s etoff rights EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master  contracts 09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that  will substantially enhance EWSs credit position with counterparties with w hom we trade multiple commodities  This setoff language which is set fort h below must be in all EWS trading form contracts  Similarly when negoti ating on third party paper we should request that this additional setoff l anguage be added MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR20 EWS TRADING CONTRACTS 09A Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D ate the Non-Defaulting Party X may at its option and in its discretio n setoff against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party Y by X or a ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreements ins truments or undertakings any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of Xs Affi liates under this Agreement or under any other agreements instruments  or undertakings  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent  of any such setoff exercised by X andor Xs Affiliates  X will give Y not ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after  the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not  affect the validity of the setoff  For purposes of this Section  Owed shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable regardless o f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced as of the Early Term ination Date  09 09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section  may be conver ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t he rate of exchange at which X acting in a reasonable manner and in good f aith would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c onverted If an obligation is unascertained X may in good faith estimate t hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate subject to the releva nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained  Nothi ng in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other securit y interest except as may be provided under applicable law   This setoff pr ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff  netting off-set combination of accounts counterclaim lien or other righ t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled whether by operatio n of law contract or otherwise  Each of the parties represent and acknow ledge that the rights set forth in this Section  are an integral part of  the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties  would not be willing to enter into Transactions  The parties further ackno wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip al and with respect to this Section  as agent on behalf of its Affilia tes which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section  and oth erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section  09B Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre ement the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default ing Party any amount under Section  until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion which may  include an opinion of its counsel that all other obligations of any kind w hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag reements instruments or undertakings which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied 09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du e and owing as of the Early Termination Date but does not include future p ayments between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates triangular se toff after the designation of an Early Termination Date  This language ha s been reviewed by US bankruptcy counsel and is appropriate under US l aws for commodity transactions with US-based counterparties  Each group  will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability   In addition  prior to introducing this language into your forms changes will be require d to terminology andor to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default eg Affected Party under ISDA  Finally when  incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms please be aw are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term s monthly netting of receivables or the close-out netting procedures app licable upon the designation of an Event of Default both of which should  remain in the trading forms  Rather this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms  When incorporating this setoff la nguage into your trading forms you will need to review the forms to determ ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi ll need to be overridden andor coordinated  Finally in order to assist a ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties This explanation will be distribut ed shortly 09If you have any questions please contact me at 713-853-6544 or

Subject	Drafting tip Look at Californias spin on contract provisions preventing California from seeking FERC review of contract prices  California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power  Rather than protecting suppliers these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutiny---sch THE STATE Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking US Review of Prices Crisis The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations Consumer advocates want the agreements redone By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITERS October 15 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Buried in the fine print of the long-term contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the states right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances because its patently ridiculous said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are just and reasonable If the FERC finds otherwise it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits In recent weeks Loretta Lynch president of the state Public Utilities Commission has asked the FERC to review two of the states long-term power contracts The prices and terms of those contracts may be unjust and unreasonable Lynch said Neither contract had the no-challenge clause But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition Lynch expressed outrage They didnt want anybody looking over their shoulder she said From my perspective that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state    If they thought this was a reasonable contract why wouldnt they want FERC to uphold their deal States Bargaining Position Was Weak The companies with no-challenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing Dynegy Power Marketing Sempra Energy Resources Allegheny Energy Supply Co Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing  Trading S David Freeman the states chief negotiator on long-term power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis At the time the contracts were negotiated the states two largest utilities Pacific Gas  Electric and Southern California Edison had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January he said They were asking Is this a serious deal Is the state of California committed to it What are you going to say--no Then youre not going to get a deal The state began a hurried effort to negotiate long-term contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights The costs threatened to bankrupt the states utilities which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers State officials negotiated dozens of contracts some lasting as long as 10 years which offered prices ranging from 58 to 249 per megawatt-hour--a far cry from the 500 per megawatt-hour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time But by summer the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped California suddenly found itself paying more under the long-term contracts than the 15-to-30 per megawatt-hour offered on the spot market Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts They were pretty much desperate said Mike Florio senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco We were talking about windfall profits taxes and seizing power plants and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down which they have Michael J Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said the clauses provided the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say were willing to invest in California Its not that were superseding anything frankly its that weve said we dont want the party weve done the transaction with to try to derail it Niggli said He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review The question becomes Will FERC accept that or consider that  he said And then Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form  Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny Frankly I wasnt too concerned about the clause Freeman said I dont think its enforceable Enforceable or not Bowen said the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasnt an evenhanded situation she said I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances but that doesnt excuse officials from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now For information about reprinting this article go to

Zimmer Michael J Sent Wed 10312001 321 PM To Cc Subject E-Notes Risk Considerations for Enron Counterparties Failure to Exercise Rights May Constitute Waiver   OLEObj  E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy  and public utility law  October 31 2001  RISK CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENRON COUNTERPARTIES  FAILURE TO EXERCISE RIGHTS MAY CONSTITUTE WAIVER        The reduction by Moodys Investor Service Inc of Enron Corps  senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1 this week may be an  issue of concern for companies that are counterparts to Enron obligations  This downgrade may have immediate consequences under existing transactions  with Enron given that its current credit rating is now two levels above  non-investment grade  Any further downgrade into non-investment grade  levels could seriously affect relationships between counterparties and  Enron and possibly Enron counterparties and their counterparties        Enron is the principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and  natural gas trades in the United States  For Enrons power and gas  trading counterparties a credit event such as a downgrade by Moodys may  precipitate certain obligations under the terms of their trading  transactions  For example any downgrade not just a downgrade resulting  in a sub-investment grade rating may entitle a counterparty to require  Enron to provide additional credit in support of Enrons purchase  obligations  Counterparties should examine all power gas or other  commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess  this right  The failure to exercise this right may constitute a waiver  and foreclose access to critical performance and payment assurance  threatening to alter the risk assessment and mitigation considerations  upon which the transactions were originally based  Furthermore a failure  to declare a credit event or default against Enron could cause a default  on the part of the counterparty itself in collateral or ancillary  arrangements such as its financing  The potential for a domino effect  causing defaults or credit events in a series of transactions is  considerable        It is uncertain whether Enrons efforts to obtain new lines of  credit will be sufficient to overcome the current difficulties  Regardless it is prudent to review the terms of existing transactions  with Enron or its affiliates including any guarantees or other forms of  corporate credit support  It is also advisable to examine the terms of  transactions dependent on or otherwise ancillary to transactions with  Enron or its affiliates to avoid any consequential effects of the Enron  credit ratings downgrade        For further information on how Enrons current financial situation  could impact your firms transaction risk profile please contact Michael  Zimmer at 2024527055 or michaeljzimmerbakernetcom Jonathan W  Gottlieb at 2024527084 or

Triangular Set-Off Combinations 3  Mandatory Set-Off Language for EWS Trading Contracts -  Revision 1 bl acklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke 4  Clean copy of attachment 3 5  Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions and 6  Square Set-Off Provision This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment  At your r equest I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading  Contracts as well as the set-off language in the draft Master Netting Set-O ff and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of set-off that w ill be enforceable in Canada  For the moment I have considered the laws  applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner Kevi n McElcheran Unlike certain jurisdictions including for example Great Britain in Ca nada  a creditors set-off rights are generally preserved in an insolvency Section 973 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act RSC 1985 c B-3 a s amended and section 181 of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act SC  1985 c C-36 as amended both expressly reserve application of the law of set-off in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply  Contra ctual set-off provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provid ed the contract of which the set-off provision is part is itself enforceabl e ie has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privit y and consideration Set-off is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar -for-dollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent company  This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who wou ld otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the setting-off credit or to the insolvent company The essence of set-off is mutuality the setting-off of a claim and cross-c laim between the same parties  The difficulty with the expansive set-off t erms sought by Enron is that they would permit set-off as between Enron a nd its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party  My concern is th at such purported set-off is so different in substance from the common no tion of set-off which requires mutuality as to be set-off in name only  W ithout mutuality I am concerned that a court may not recognize such set-o ff of obligations relating to third parties as set-off within the meanin g of Canadian insolvency legislation  The concern is not only that a court may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolven t state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estates indebtedness to a cred itor  The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purpor ts to do that as something other than set-off known under the laws of Canad a  I am not however aware of any case law on point With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality I have incorporated language referred to in the materials as an aggregate liabi lity clause to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and cross-c laim will be between the same parties The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in squa re and triangular set-off  These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim  and cross-claim Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts att achment 3 I have the following comments 1    I have included wording to clarify that the option to set-off is to b e exercised jointly by X and its affiliates  The reason for this is to avo id the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to e xercise inconsistent set-off options  We must assume that this set-off pro vision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and va rious Enron affiliates  If the counterparty defaults on more than one of t hese contracts or if they contain cross-default provisions the Enron af filiate that is a party to each separate contract would be X under that c ontract and would have the option to exercise the set-off rights thereunder including the right to set-off against amounts it owes amounts that are o wed to any of its affiliates  Those affiliates may each in turn be X und er their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise set-off ri ghts  While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsi stently in exercising set-off rights making it clear that the option to se t-off must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates minimizes any atta ck of the set-off provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to set-off 2  With respect to the requirement that the set-off contract must have con sideration I have included an acknowledgement by the parties including af filiates that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants i nvolved  This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of con sideration but is helpful 3  Paragraph B is included to address the mutuality requirement by inclu ding an aggregate liability clause as discussed above 4  In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Co ntracts the changes to the sentence including limitation to have been ma de to clarify that the set-off provision is without limitation to any other rights which X or its affiliates may have  I was concerned that the with out prejudice language in the prior draft would leave it open to the defa ulting party to argue that the set-off provision cannot work to its prejudi ce 5  The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an att empt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved  In attach ment 3 I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is  not as clear and certain as it might be  I have also attached a revised tr iangular set-off provision attachment 5 which is clearer more certain an d about one page longer Finally I have included a square set-off provision attachment 6 which af fords Enron and any non-defaulting counterparty even better set-off prote ction  As discussed I will include this provision in the Master Netting  Setoff and Security Agreement form I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience Best

sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration -By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires 202-862-6647 BryanLeedowjonescom

running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing I like the proposal to merge the discussions but You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldnt consider merging the discussions contracting groups  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer Sharis name came up a lot he said he did not think it would ever work  Im all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members drafting committee and all would relish it as well  What do you think is the next best step ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK  Lets talk about this also Hoping not to stay the course again  Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 -----Original Message-----From 	Hall Steve C Legal Sent	Wednesday October 24 2001 1150 AM To	Yoder Christian Sager Elizabeth Subject	Faith-based contracting I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs munis and federal PMAs I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract its almost a religion  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran Whether its assimilation or merger or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract---Why should I change the agreements are virtually identical -----Original Message-----From 	Yoder Christian Sent	Wednesday October 24 2001 928 AM To	Sager Elizabeth Cc	Hall Steve C Legal Subject	FW Legal Discussion Elizabeth I am going to divide my presentation into two parts  One is going to be designed to give the marketers talking points  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach Unless you agree with and support this kind of How Enron views the WSPP policy I shouldnt be advocating it at the meeting Enrons view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements one that is almost like the other one  Valuable resource time is being wasted  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West dealing with the emerging California changes and open access in Oregon and Nevada   Right now the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour dLane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such  He wants to feel loved  Therefore  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization  but at the same time advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects  Rosman should say  Enron loves the WSPP  it has done a great job with the contract reformation  that task is done  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks  Lets get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess  Otherwise we pit Enrons clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result The world including our little western power world is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational  It is full of all of the conflicts of history ambitious tirades irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon  They are not going to go away  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front  As our headquarters commander I beg you to  let Steve and me as field operatives   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach   ----cgy -----Original Message-----From 	Rosman

Refunds In Pacific NW FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW 09242001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc WASHINGTON -Dow Jones- The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldnt order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices werent unreasonable and unlike California the market is a competitive market concluded Carmen Cintron the FERC judge presiding over the case The spiraling prices in Californias dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the regions high electricity prices which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought the judge said Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on Cintron said Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers the judge said The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc PSD and dismiss the case At issue were refund claims totaling more than 19 billion with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the states Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec 25 2000 to June 20 2001 In July FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct 2 2000 through June 20 2001 The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December Unlike California the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market Cintron told the commission Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market Cintron concluded This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard Cintron said California sought 1466 billion of the nearly 2 billion in total claims The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle 278 million Tacoma Wash 654 million Clark Wash 64 million Eugene Ore 397 million Sacramento Calif 46 million and Northern Wasco County Ore 4 million Also the Port of Seattle sought 94 million in refunds Cintron was persuaded by the ripple claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds Unraveling these transactions is to be mildly stated a complex task Cintron said The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the Pacific Northwest wholesale electricity market the judge said Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale she said The commission may either accept or reject Cintrons recommendations which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed In the event FERC does move to order refunds Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the regions bilateral contracts market While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration -By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires 202-862-6647 BryanLeedowjonescom
