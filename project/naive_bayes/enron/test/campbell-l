Thanks Larry for passing this along.  This is good news, if in fact the good doctor has isolated the solvent contact time (so the solution has maximum effectiveness as the entrained pigs apply it to the walls of the pipe).  That was one of the issues that bothered me most about the effectiveness of an application.  Would the solvent be uniformly applied and in the proper timeframe so that the PCB's would be absorbed and transported to an pre-determined extraction point?  It sounds like the model is ready.  After you receive the report and if you agree, I would be willing to discuss with Louie another no-cost extension.  John

Dear Larry:
It was good hearing from you a few days ago. We are wrapping up a progress
report on the project but I can tell you briefly what we have accomplished
so far. We have finished the PCB model development/modification to
incorporate most of the main ideas that we talked about when you, John and
your crew visited us. Specifically, we have been able to extend the model
significantly to include flow regime impact on cleanup efficiency and the
amount of solvent that will be required. We have looked at the issue of
contact time and contact area. These two and some of the other salient
issues turned out to be more challenging to handle than we had originally
anticipated but we have now nailed them. In fact, the new program finally
worked well and debugged only about 2-3 weeks ago. Since then we have been
doing shake-down testing and all is well so far. The results are exciting as
you would see in the report. There are two tasks that we would now embark
on. Now that the model has all the principal mechanisms incorporated, we are
now planning a comprehensive production runs where we will give you cleanup
options, etc with critical evaluations of those. That will probably take us
until the end of January. This is where I will need to talk to you very
often to determine what options make most sense to run so that we do not
just run millions of options.
	Along this line, we will need another no-cost extension letter from
you so as to continue the work beyond December. We can talk about how long
if you want so as to determine what you would really like to be the
concluding point. So, I will call you after sending the report, which should
be by Monday next week. Thanks and best regards.

David, I got hte same message from Don.  I found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Christ with him.  Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal Christian.  So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.  Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focused also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.     

It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.  The gossip and garbage going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.   Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  I hope that this turns many to Jesus.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.  

Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....

I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation. Although Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  Danny said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.  I will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports.

Sta. 3 and 4, I am sending to you via regular mail, the new air permits for the Redrock Expansion.  I will be contacting you in the near future about coming out and going through the permits to assign responsibilities between you and me.  If you get some time, I would suggest that you look over each permit as there is additional recordkeeping and reporting above that which is on your existing permit.  the old permit will expire when the facility begins operation of the turbine.  For Station 4, if a turbine is not installed at your location, this new permit wont apply.  But in the event it happens, you have the permit.

Bottom line, you need to keep this permit at each location.

Larry, 
Do you know if Enron is hiring for IS people?  My brother in law just  graduated with a degree in MIS and is looking for a job after the summer.   He is finishing up with his classes this summer.
 
He was saying he wanted to work with ERP...whatever that means.  And  People Soft, whatever that is too.
 
Can you help me out please.

I came across this web site and knew you would enjoy it... 
 
It's called realFamilies and has really interesting articles about parenting and marriage. You can check them out at http://www.realfamilies.com

It features a funny and insightful psychologist named Dr. Kevin Leman, and he also has a TV show that you can watch online too.

Scott, it seems that the letter we received from Danny is otherwise.   In the process of having the Navajo EPA take over the drinking water program for the Tribe, the EPA as overseer wants to be kept in the loop for a little while longer.  In light of this, we need to not only send to the EPA all monthly sampling reports for drinding, but also to the Yolanda Barney of the Navanl Nation.  I spoke with Danny about this and he said that the EPAs involvement would start  to deminish in the future but he didnt when.

Do we or do we not have send analysis results to Danny every month?  I thought you said to only send them to Navajo Nation EPA (Yolanda Barney) so that's what I was doing.

Ed I have been busy in Az and have neglected your email.  Sorry about that.  Is there a one page form that I can submit that will say that nothing has changed at a faility in the last 5 years for the below facilities?  Either that or I can write a one page letter stating this fact and reqeust that the OCD renew the permit again.  Which is best for you?

Here's a listing of the permits expiring over the next year or so:

	GW-89		Corona C.S.		Exprers 3/9/02
	GW-95		Laguna C.S.		Expires 3/9/02
	GW-109	Carlsbad C.S.		Expires 5/18/02
	GW-110	Mountainair C.S.	Expires 5/18/02
	GW-113	Eunice C.S.		Expires 6/19/02
	GW-283	Jal C.S.			Expires	6/24/02
	GW-285	Bisti C.S.		Expires 9/24/02

As you know, if you get your renewal applications in 120 prior to the
expiration date, the permit will not expire on the dates above, but will
extend until all paperwork is done on my end.

We need to go out and look at all of these at some point in time, but I will
get back with you to set up a schedule.

Take care and have a good Thanksgiving.

Subject:	RE: Draft, Flagstaff Spring meeting


Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

Randy, I tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered.  I thought you might have changed your address.  Guess I typed it in by mistake. (age does that to you sometimes).  Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.  I never thought I d see the Enron empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the Enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of Enron.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.  Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on Jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.

Sorry to hear that there is the word "reorganization"  in Hess.  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.  I hate this kind of stuff. I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.  Ill keep you in prayer. Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?  Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.  Just like Peter wrote, were just pilgrims in a foregin land, waiting for the trip home and promise of Christ's return.

Larry, 
I have been thinking of you a lot with all of the Enron stuff going on.  You
and your family are in my prayers because I know what a strain this kind of
uncertainty can put on a person.  We are also facing layoffs this coming
January.  We have a new president and are going through a restructuring.  So
we are all uncertain if we will have a job this coming February.  Keep me
posted on how things are going with you.  I will be praying for you.  At
least we have the knowledge that God is in control and that nothing happens
to us that is not first filtered through His everlasting love.

Your brother,
Randy

Rich, concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact Transwestern if Duke should direct the liquids from their 8" line into the pipeline liquids tank at Wt-1, I have a concern.  

The liquids that are generated in the 8" line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations (RCRA) as long as they stay in the Duke line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank.  Because WT-1 is a mainline compressor station, any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank.  Within the past few years, we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt-1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern.  Chemicals which producers and processing, upstream of Wt-1, have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal.  Unfortunately, there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials.

Based upon this, I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank.

Subject:	results of football pool

Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

John, Im in the office for a few hours cleaning out email and stomping out some minor fires.  The two RMEF persons we met with are Dan Walker and Allen Kerby.  Allen is the regional director for NM and TX.  Dan was the guy we picked up at the airport from Montana.  I think his title was VP of business operations?  His number is 1-800-225-5355.  Allen's number in Las Vegas NM is 505-454-9390.  Hope that all is well with you and the family.

Larry,

Just wanted to confirm what I told you on the phone this morning.  The
recent permit mods have no effect on when your annual compliance
certifications are due.  Those are always based on initial permit
issuance, which was April 25.

David got your voice mail last week.  Sorry about not getting to talk with you, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give Enron my vacation.  Im not going to give it away anymore.  I would have liked to talked to you.  Things are somewhat stressful around here.  Probably worse in Houston.  Enron is screening  e mails so everyone is a little tense. Lots of things are going on with Enron trying to bail itself out of this mess.  As you may have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and Don Stevens were among those.  Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on, so I really dont know much.  This was a good time to take my vacation.  This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying on Jesus, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort. Its a good feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine.

Hows Christmas in the desert? Were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree?  this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.

David, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry Christmas.  I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.  When we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.  I pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people  in Katar and remember the love of Christ that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.  I am thankful for our Great High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of Holies.  May God bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of His love and grace.

Merry Christmas, Your brother in Christ

Subject:	Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings

Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made "but for" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

Subject: Summary of Progress


Dear Larry:
It was good hearing from you a few days ago. We are wrapping up a progress
report on the project but I can tell you briefly what we have accomplished
so far. We have finished the PCB model development/modification to
incorporate most of the main ideas that we talked about when you, John and
your crew visited us. Specifically, we have been able to extend the model
significantly to include flow regime impact on cleanup efficiency and the
amount of solvent that will be required. We have looked at the issue of
contact time and contact area. These two and some of the other salient
issues turned out to be more challenging to handle than we had originally
anticipated but we have now nailed them. In fact, the new program finally
worked well and debugged only about 2-3 weeks ago. Since then we have been
doing shake-down testing and all is well so far. The results are exciting as
you would see in the report. There are two tasks that we would now embark
on. Now that the model has all the principal mechanisms incorporated, we are
now planning a comprehensive production runs where we will give you cleanup
options, etc with critical evaluations of those. That will probably take us
until the end of January. This is where I will need to talk to you very
often to determine what options make most sense to run so that we do not
just run millions of options.
	Along this line, we will need another no-cost extension letter from
you so as to continue the work beyond December. We can talk about how long
if you want so as to determine what you would really like to be the
concluding point. So, I will call you after sending the report, which should
be by Monday next week. Thanks and best regards.

Hey Larry,

I made some changes to 7-19...

695979.1 & 695995.1 - had extra hour (HE 23) - I zeroed this hour out (NYISO 5081505)
694766.1 - missing HE 11&12 per PJM & NYISO - I added these two hours in

Please check these changes and let me know if you do not agree with them.

Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

Charlie, when Butch had Getman's wife count the number of people using the water at Station 5, did the number of users not equal the public water system numbers (ie 25 people daily at least 60 days per year?)  I though we were always a public water system at Station 5?   We better discuss this, as we could be in some trouble if we do service 25 people and are not doing the sampling.....

Stations 3,4 and 5.  I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation. Although Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  Danny said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.  I will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports.

Subject:=09Why Christmas?



There was once a man who didn't believe in God, and he =20
didn't hesitate to let others know how he felt about religion and =20
religious holidays, like Christmas. His wife, however, did=20
believe, and she raised their children to also  have faith in=20
God and Jesus, despite  his disparaging comments.  =20
=20
One snowy Christmas Eve, his wife was taking  their children=20
to a Christmas Eve service in the farm  community in which they=20
lived.  She  asked him to come, but he refused. =20
=20
"That story is nonsense!" he said. "Why would  God lower=20
Himself to come to Earth as a man?  That's ridiculous!" So=20
she and the children left,  and he stayed home.  =20
=20
A while later, the winds grew stronger and the  snow turned=20
into a blizzard.  As the man  looked out the window, all he=20
saw was a blinding snowstorm.   He sat down to relax before =20
the fire for the evening. Then he heard  a loud thump.  =20
Something had hit the window. Then another  thump. He  =20
looked out, but couldn't see  more than a few feet. When the=20
snow let up a little, he ventured  outside to see what could=20
have been beating on  his window.  In the field near his=20
house he saw a flock of wild geese. Apparently  they had been=20
flying south for the winter when they got  caught in the snowstorm =20
and couldn't go on. They were lost and  stranded on his farm, with no=20
food or shelter. They just flapped  their wings and flew around the field=
=20
in low circles, blindly and  aimlessly. A couple of them had flown into=20
his window, it  seemed.=20
=20
The man felt sorry for the geese and wanted to  help them. The barn=20
would  be a great place for them to stay,  he thought. It's warm and safe;=
=20
surely they could spend the night  and wait out the storm. So he walked ove=
r to=20
the barn and  opened the doors wide, then watched and waited, hoping they =
=20
would notice the open barn and go inside. But the geese just  fluttered aro=
und=20
aimlessly and didn't seem to notice the barn or  realize what it could mean=
=20
for them.  The man tried to get  their attention, but that just seemed to s=
care=20
them and they  moved further away. He went into the house and came with  so=
me=20
bread, broke it up, and made a breadcrumbs trail leading to  the barn.  The=
y=20
still didn't catch on.=20
=20
Now he was getting frustrated. He got behind  them and tried to shoo them=
=20
toward the barn, but they only got more scared  and scattered in every=20
direction except toward the barn. Nothing he  did could get them to go into=
=20
the barn where they would be warm  and safe. "Why don't they follow me?!" =
=20
he exclaimed.  "Can't they see this is the only place where they  can survi=
ve=20
the storm?" He thought for a moment and realized  that they just wouldn't f=
ollow=20
a human. "If only I were a  goose, then I could save them," he said out lou=
d. =20

Then  he had an idea. He went into barn, got one of his own geese, and carr=
ied it  in his  arms as he circled around behind the flock of  wild   geese=
.  He then released it. His goose flew through the flock and  straight into=
 the barn--and one by one the other geese followed it to  safety.  =20

He stood silently for a moment as the words he  had spoken a few minutes ea=
rlier replayed in his mind: "If only I were  a goose, then I  could save th=
em!" Then he thought about what he  had said to his wife earlier. =20
=20
"Why would God want to be like us? That's  ridiculous!"  =20
=20
Suddenly it all made sense. That is what God  had done. We were like the=20
geese--blind, lost, perishing. God had His Son  become like us so He could=
=20
show us the way and save us. That was  the meaning of Christmas, he realize=
d. =20


As the winds and blinding snow died down, his soul became quiet =20
and pondered this wonderful thought. Suddenly he understood what  Christmas=
 was=20
all about, why Christ had come.    Years  of doubt and disbelief=20
vanished like the passing storm. He fell to his knees in the snow, and  pra=
yed his first  prayer: "Thank You, God, for coming in human form to  get me=
 out of the storm!"
=20

Please provide any helpful info you have as soon as possible.

HE 10 EDT - Just an FYI that the purchase price was changed to $41/MW from $42 at the request of Exelon to our Settlements group.  I went ahead and changed it due to the low value and because it is in our favor.  If you disagree with this or have any questions, please let me know.

FYI from Penn State on the progress of the model to remove PCB's from Transwetern's pipeline.

Dear Larry:
It was good hearing from you a few days ago. We are wrapping up a progress
report on the project but I can tell you briefly what we have accomplished
so far. We have finished the PCB model development/modification to
incorporate most of the main ideas that we talked about when you, John and
your crew visited us. Specifically, we have been able to extend the model
significantly to include flow regime impact on cleanup efficiency and the
amount of solvent that will be required. We have looked at the issue of
contact time and contact area. These two and some of the other salient
issues turned out to be more challenging to handle than we had originally
anticipated but we have now nailed them. In fact, the new program finally
worked well and debugged only about 2-3 weeks ago. Since then we have been
doing shake-down testing and all is well so far. The results are exciting as
you would see in the report. There are two tasks that we would now embark
on. Now that the model has all the principal mechanisms incorporated, we are
now planning a comprehensive production runs where we will give you cleanup
options, etc with critical evaluations of those. That will probably take us
until the end of January. This is where I will need to talk to you very
often to determine what options make most sense to run so that we do not
just run millions of options.
	Along this line, we will need another no-cost extension letter from
you so as to continue the work beyond December. We can talk about how long
if you want so as to determine what you would really like to be the
concluding point. So, I will call you after sending the report, which should
be by Monday next week. Thanks and best regards.

Steve, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the engine load was 89%.  If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testing for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.  My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it.

    Update:  

      I have communicated with Rick Stallings (Cubix Corp) about an hour ago and Rick recalls our past conversation concerning the horsepower & load discrepancies for unit 703.  Rick no longer has the data in his data base, but will be glad to make the necessary adjustments with attached explanations for our records in case their are any questions.

     The corrected torque load should have been 96 %.
    
Larry Wayne will this work for you?

Steve

Don I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God h=
ate to see pain hit a family member.  Even under the most dire and seemingl=
y impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will n=
ever leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and securi=
ty knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  Whe=
n you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many tim=
es we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because=
 he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to e=
mpty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill u=
s with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His =
spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work ever=
ything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and =
understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth b=
egins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very tem=
porary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation o=
f God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in =
your Christian walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportuni=
ties. =20

When you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.  Sharing Christ w=
ith someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations=
.  In Hebrews were told  to encourage the brethren.  I would consider it an=
 honor to hear form you again....keep the faith...  its all we have........=
.   =20

Subject:	Keystone Revision

Please respond to Mr. Campbell,

Based on the recent information acquired from Solar the Keystone turbine is
not subject to GG.  Argent has revised the renewal application to change the
GOP index # to a negative applicability code.  Since the GOP was revised
last year to add the GG code, this is classified as a revision to the GOP.
The following pages were revised;
1. OP-2 form Table 1
2. OP-REQ1 form pages 9 and 12
3. OP-UA11 form
4. Process description was revised to add a paragraph explaining the reason
for the revision
5. Add Appendix G: Solar Turbine Documentation
6. Revised Table of Content to add the Appendix G
7. Revised the matrix table changing the "Notes" entry for unit 3 from
"Subject to 40 CFR 60 GG" to "40 CFR 60"

Attached are the affected files.  Th eleven renewals for your area were hand
delivered to Mr. Child yesterday (November 27).  If Mr. Child has access to
Microsoft Word and an Adobe reader version he can replace the revised pages.
You can request that Mr. Child replace the revised pages or Argent can send
him another copy of the renewal.  Please let me know your preference.

Subject:	Wednesday's Conference Call

Due to uncertainty and proposed changes to the ETS safety/env conference that is to be held next spring it has been decided to pospone the conference call scheduled for Wednesday, until we are better informed as to the direction we will be required to go (i.e. there is a good chance the conference may be a shortened version held in Houston).  Until some of those decisions are made by upper management, it will be difficult to do a very good job of planning.  I will be glad to set up another conference call when conditions warrent.
