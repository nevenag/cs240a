Greg - here is Randy's resume. He is the guy I was telling you about on Friday as we were walking out of the building. I think he could make Enron a lot of money.

Get some time on my calendar to go over some of this stuff either this week or next.  
It looks like you've accomplished a lot in redirecting our efforts.  we should talk about what happens next and where you see the major opportunities.
Regarding your request for help, you don't need help to refuse to accept "dogs and cats" while the BU  tries to keep the good investments.  Just refuse to accept the garbage without conditions.  Don't waste too much time playing investment cop on the BUs.  You have more important things to do.  Also, refusing to negotiate with the BUs is like going on a hunger strike.

Subject:	Principal Investments Update

Ken, Greg, and Dave,

Please review update and provide any comments.

Where to begin?

Here are the items currently accomplished
Reduced personnel associated with investments from 55 to 31.  This was a very necessary evil to get things in control.
Reduced individuals actually responsible for pursuing investments from 15 to 4.  This will choke down investment flow to a manageable level.
Completed full day meeting with entire team to lay out complete integration plans and process standardization program.
Place a 60 day moratorium on any new investments, while we get our hands around the existing portfolio and develop new strategy.
New company number and cost center is set up and will begin on 7/1 (in 5 days).
Assigned any "stranded" or "orphaned" investments to a senior member of the team.  All companies have subsequently been contacted to notify of new investment manager.
Notified HEOF investors (women and minority fund) of change in strategy.  Will be meeting with investors to negotiate change to key man provision on Friday.
Found space.  We will all be moving to the 36th floor by mid to late July.

Here is what is in progress:
Searching across the organization for any additional investments residing in miscellaneous business units.  I am currently in London, where 4-6 investments currently reside (depending on what you consider an investment).  I expect there will be 90-100 investments consolidated into this group once I am through.
I am already having to fight a few battles to keep a few new investments from occurring.  This includes in EES and Enron Europe.  Bad ideas, bad deals, bad structures.  Basically, repeating patterns of past failures.
We are undertaking a complete revamping and standardization of all our investments processes, including deal filtering, modeling, due diligence, all back office systems, portfolio tracking, comparable company analysis, term sheets, approval process, etc.  Each of these is a major task, but we are targeting the end of August for completion.
Identifying and establishing other support functions for the group, including legal, accounting, RAC, HR, PR, etc.  This is going well and everything should be resolved within 2 more weeks.
Began budget preparation for last 6 months of 2001.  Should be completed within 3 weeks.

The only item that I need help on is support in shutting down certain developing pockets of investment activity, and making certain that all merchant investments get transferred.  Basically, there are a couple of groups that want to give me the dogs and cats and keep things with potential upside.  Also, there are some efforts to make a miscellaneous investment here or there.  I am not willing to negotiate with the business units on these issues.

Greg, the Call Center called me on Friday saying that your products had dropped off the WEB during the maintenance window on EOL.  The reason for this is that each month your product has a different Product ID, and your September product did not have the flag set to not suspend. I have set the flag in the database for product "53549, US WTI Swap Nymex LD Sept 01" so that it will not suspend in the future.  Also we have added a procedure in the Control Center to make sure we check for this near the end of every month so we set the flag appropriately for each new month's product.

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

The following are some PEP stats on number of meetings at year end vs. mid year 2001; number of feedbacks completed between those two periods; average user session length, and average length of PRC (only at mid year 2001 -- we do not have a comparison on this with year end).  
 
Hope these are of interest to you.

Given what our announcement next week is going to look like,  do you think it is a good idea to issue some options to some key players soon after the announcement.  as sort of a down payment on bonus perhaps.  i think it would be best to keep it to a reasonably small group.  lets try to talk tomorrow and see if you have anyone we need to do this for.

Not a problem, I'm sure it was just an oversight.  Your assistant left a msg on Friday asking me to forward another copy of invoice.  I don't have electronic copy but can fax hard copy to you.  Plse advise fax number.

 
On the Vitol front, they just celebrated their 35th anniversary last weekend with a companywide outing in Spain.  I'm having lunch with some of the guys on Wednesday and will give you brief on latest sentiment on strategic front.  Neil.

Subject:=09PRC Process



=09=09=09=09

=09I have long thought that the PRC Process needs to be changed in order to=
 better provide the appropriate feedback and motivation as well as rewards =
that a good review process should.  I hope you will consider my thoughts ca=
refully since I have had active involvement in the process from its incepti=
on and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered. =20

=09It appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing =
to the employee being reviewed.  Even those that do well are suspicious of =
the process and don't particularly like it.  It causes a great deal of stre=
ss on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people that=
 should be supportive of it.  There is a belief that the process is arbitra=
ry and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rathe=
r the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative succes=
s of any particular reviewer.  The biggest single complaint seems to be the=
 fact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are ex=
cellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse.  =
While the employee's performance may have suffered during that period of ti=
me, the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance ha=
s declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are not=
 as good as they were six months earlier.  We are mixing the message betwee=
n the worth of the individual and the results of their performance.  The fo=
llowing is my recommendation to improve on this system:

=09SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES  =20

=09
=091.  Employee Skill, Competency and Character  - This category measures a=
 persons inherent skill, talent, intelligence and commitments to Enron's va=
lues.  This determinant should not change drastically between each review p=
eriod since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change s=
lowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better=
 qualified employees.  In this category a person could be told whether they=
 are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunit=
y to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing =
that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires.  This parti=
cular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hirin=
g and training program.

=092.  Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is per=
forming the tasks of any particular job.  This measure could fluctuate much=
 more than the first since each person's performance can vary greatly over =
time based on many different circumstances.  This measure would also distin=
guish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or =
greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are=
 outstanding performers.  It should also help identify those who are under =
performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first ca=
tegory.  This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of p=
eople since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform abov=
e and beyond their own capability.

=093.  Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result =
of the effort of any individual employee.  I believe this criteria is most =
suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining fact=
or (but not the only on) in annual bonus payments.  This should be closely =
correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since s=
ome people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at som=
e future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by bein=
g in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it with=
out the appropriate effort.

=09In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descri=
ptions that are included in the PRC process.  I think it is a waste of time=
 to include clerks,  assistants, accounting personnel and other non manager=
 commercial support people in the process.  Very little is gained by them o=
r by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created. =
 I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and on=
ly focus on the first two performance categories at that time.  I would als=
o change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the s=
ummer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end wh=
en there is so much other business activity going on.  I think a March, Sep=
tember schedule would work much better.

=09There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am =
sure that you are working on them.  Please give my ideas some thought and s=
ee if they don't merit some consideration.

Greg,
     A suggestion has been made that the EBS "Competitive Analysis" unit (4 people) be added on to my group, and that it continue to support EBS research/fundamentals needs.  I'm fine with this, but based on your comments earlier today (re: hesitation of integrating EBS into EWS), is this something I should embrace?  

-Scott 

PS.  FYI, I'm working with Delainey to establish a Marketing Intelligence shop in EES.  I think we can help them fairly substantially, both with strategic marketing support and on the tactical deal level.  I've hired a guy who has worked for me in the past, Kevin Golden, to head up this effort and to begin to develop the necessary networks and infrastructure.  

PPS  In the meantime, folks are compiling the necessary information to examine the outsourcing to the technical group.  Several new projects seem to be materializing, which could be candidates for outsourcing:  gas storage/flows, refineries (operations and outages), and near-real time ship monitoring.

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

At the end of the Leadership Giving Campaign, EWS had reached $488,832 in pledges, which is 38.31% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000.  Enron's plan calls for Leadership Givers to represent 60% of the total pledge goal, so we are short 21.69% or $276,768.  Even more disappointing was the weak 7.85% participation rate by those employees in the Leadership level (i.e., over $90,000 in base pay).  While part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a Leadership campaign for EBS, most of the other business units/functional groups in EWS did not fare too well either.  

Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by functional group:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
	EA			$79,485		10.78%
	EBS			$14,555		1.31%
	EEOS			$32,143		18.18%
	EEL			$6,104		14.29%
	EGM			$74,030		11.53%
	EIM			$62,567		21.62%
	ENW			$77,960		3.82%
	EWS Bus. Analysis	$25,024		12.84%
	EWS Bus. Dev.		$13,438		75.00%
	EWS HR		$6,985		8.33%
	EWS Legal		$38,800		20.65%
	EWS Research		$19,080		23.40%
	EWS Treasury		$13,661		71.43%
	EWS TOTAL		$488,832	7.85%

From a corporate perspective, EWS is tracking fairly closely to the others.  Here are the other groups' totals:

	ETS			$146,466	12.92%

Tom,

i really do understand your concern, and i will try to expedite this process as much as possible.  i'm sorry that all of this wasn't worked out prior to signing the merger, but we put it together rather quickly.  we have built an incredible energy franchise here and neither of us, Enron or Dynegy, wants it to falter.  i will get you as much information as i can, as soon as i can.  i would be happy to hear any ideas that you have on providing more stability sooner.

thanks for sending the note, and i apologize for the uncertainty.

Subject:	Employee retainment

Dear Greg,

I appreciate you coming down to the gas floor and providing us some information about what is going on.

One of the questions that kept getting asked had to do with who will be retained, and what we will be paid when we are retained.  We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?

I understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.

What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. 

Scott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?

Getting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.

Please sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.

Tom Donohoe

I sincerely apologize if I said anything offensive, and really do appreciate everyone who is trying to help us solve our problems.  At this time we are suffering a severe crisis of investor confidence, and we were only trying to be honest about the things we have done as a company.  I certainly know as well as anyone else that many of these investment decisions were made by people who are long gone.  Hopefully those of us who are here can correct their mistakes.

I really do recognize and appreciate your work.

Subject:	... we definitely made some very bad investments ...

Ken and Greg

I am part of the Enron Tax Department, assigned currently to Enron Global Assets, previously to Enron India.  Your comment regarding the very bad investments Enron made in international assets is absolutely true.  Perhaps the assets themselves are not all that bad, Enron just over-paid, over-built or over-leveraged.  In some cases, I suspect we did all three!  

But that's not the point of this message.

When you make statements like you did in yesterday's Investor conference call it erodes EGA's ability to sell those assets (who wants to buy a very bad investment ?) and chokes the spirit of the employees who have remained loyal to Enron and continue to support the needs of EGA.  The 100 or so members in the EGA support group did not make the bad decisions.  Those were made by former and current executives, RAC, Enron's Board of Directors, and others who were well-qualified to make such decisions.  I cannot begin to tell you how hard Tax, Legal, Accounting, PR, etc. worked to make the best of what often-times looked to us to be a stupid if not bad investment.  

Many of those who remain have devoted several years to Enron's international experiment.  We've given up dinner with our families, weekend soccer games and campouts, in many cases we have even sacrificed our good health.  I suspect we will continue to make those sacrifices in order to close asset sales and efficiently return to Enron the remaining value.

Please, when you proclaim to the World the very bad investments Enron made, take some time to remind those of us who are left to unwind these investments that Enron is fortunate to have some very bright and dedicated employees diligently working to contain the damage already done.

Sincerely,

Mike Norris

Subject:        eNYMEX 

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

We have got people all over these things that know them inside and out.  This is all about managing the downside
since it all has been monetized away.  I would love to give them away but can not see any value to the
corporation in doing it at this time.  Once they have the other assets in order it might make sense to 
reevaluate.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Regards
Delainey

does this mean that on a volatility basis he thinks the options are attractively priced?  if so, i don't want him having any input to their pricing.

Crandall done 
Badeer done 
Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week. 
Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us. 
Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law. 
Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today. 
Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly. 
Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point.

On a serious note - it would appear that a fair number of folks get personal allocations for the corporate jet.  Do I get any allocation for personal aircraft usage above my current compensation level?

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

California counsel have advised us that, in view of the broad authority given the AG to investigate unfair business practices, a court will almost certainly order us to produce our contracts to the AG in response to the outstanding subpoena.  For the same reason a motion to quash the subpoena directed to PG&E, which seeks the identity of our customers and their status as direct access or on UDC service, would also likely fail.  They recommend that we voluntarily offer to produce the contracts and concentrate on protecting the more sensitive commercial documents (such as the type of documents Dennis Benevides develops) from disclosure.  Even with respect to those they are not very optimistic, given that the AG is willing to enter a protective order committing to keep the contents of those documents confidential.

Please let me know if you concur with this recommendation or would like to discuss on a conference call.

P.S.  If we do decide to produce our contracts we will first have to notify our customers pursuant to the confidentiality provisions of the contracts.

I'm sorry I haven't been more involved is setting this up, but I think the agenda looks kond of soft.  At a minimum, I would like to turn the schedule around and hit the hard subjects like Q3, risk management, and asset sales first.  I would also like to see a discussion on our funds flow, cash flow, and our balance sheet.  If we don't get these things right, none of the rest of it matters.
 
Also, I notice that Cindy Olson and Beth Tilney are in attendance.  This should only be for presentation, as they are not members of the management committee.  It also seems a bit unusual to have Beth Tilney present for a discussion on company image and presentation, and not have Mark Palmer.

do you know that your receivables have been increasing over the past few months?  currently i understand that you have about $800mm in outstanding receivables.  i don't know what the aging looks like, but it seems like a big number.  we found this while we were trying to find out why we are having a hard time getting a handle on funds flow.

Greg Piper has asked for daily access to the DPR via the Executive Viewer.  In keeping with our policy of limited access to the data, I thought that it would be best to check with you on this request.  Greg appreciates our diligence in monitoring requests for access and understands that I am running this request by you.  Let me know what you would like for us to do.  Thanks.

John,

Video is 3 minutes

Bottom line: No weather-related reasons that would preclude military operations next 72 hours (from 8am tomorrow forward)

Excellent weather (clear skies, clean frontal passage, good temperature differentials for IR target tracking as well as optics)

Subject:        eNYMEX 

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

I just saw this e-mail and I assume this is why you were looking for Mark on our floor a few minutes ago.  He is in London this week.
 
Mark wanted to talk to Mr. Lay and I encouraged him to talk to you instead.  I assured Mark not to read too much in to the omission and that you told me you valued technology and operations, but I still think he is somewhat concerned.
 
Sally is still somewhat concerned as well but she and I had lunch and she is fine.
 
I assure you I have taken you at your word and I am moving on.

Greg/Mark,

Firstly, many congratulations on your promotions, you are the best guys for the job.

I spoke to Greg Piper yesterday about his conversation with you over the management committee and would like to add my comments. I would appreciate your feedback on this and would also ask that you pass it by Ken.

I saw the recent message about the formation of the new Enron management committee. With Jeff's recent departure I understand the need to quickly reassure the shareholders, analysts and employees that we have great strength in management depth.

Given this I was surprised that there was no representation of Enron Net Works on the committee. I'm sure you will have wanted to keep the group to a manageable size, but I think that you should have at least included our CEO, Greg Piper. Here's why:

1)      EnronOnline is probably the best eCommerce application in the World. Enron have publicly milked the praise for this flagship IT system, and it is now core to Enron's trading business globally. Undoubtedly this system will be driven by the business in a multitude of directions as we seek to use it to our advantage in the future. We therefore need to be where the decisions are made.

2)    EnronOnline is only one of many world class IT systems we have developed at Enron. It gets the headlines because it is externally facing, however, all of the other internally facing systems are driven by the business too. There are things we can do and things we can't. We need to be represented at the management committee to ensure that the many management decisions that rely on IT are made with clear understanding of the IT implications.

3)    Many progressive and innovative companies now view IT as the backbone of their organisation (I think we have said this a number of times in public) and ensure there is board level IT representation in the company. Analysts will look at Enron and ask why we are not the same, especially given EnronOnline.

4)    Enron Net Works will be spending about $750,000,000 of Enron's money in 2002.

5)    Two and a half thousand Enron Net Works employees will already have read the management memo and will be asking why Enron Net Works is the only Enron unit not represented at the top. They will be asking what this tells them about their management (Greg and I) and also be wondering if they are again to be second-class Enron citizens. In this post-Skilling period, we need to be motivating our employees, not putting more doubts into their minds.

6)    Whilst keeping the management committee to mainly the larger revenue generating units, I see that there is representation from Accounts, Legal, Controls. IT should be up there too.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope that it may make you reconsider having Greg Piper in the commitee.

 

Best regards

MRP

I understand, but this is a difficult measure to build into a budget system, other than simply limiting the amount of capital you have available to meet your IBIT target.  We can't allow a dicision to cut IBIT by 90% and capital by 95% and call it a success.  The easiest way to control deployment of capital is thru a deal approval process.

My perception is that the Q4 and 2002 bugets are still only focused on IBIT.
I can easily make my numbers if I use a bunch of capital.  But how are we doing sending out the
additional messages to reduce capital deployed and to increase net income.  From this corner of
the world my perpsecptive is this needs more focus.  For all your free time....

got your message on cta.   it usually gets picked up in the analysis, but i guess tax usually does too.  this tax issue seemed to surprise everyone.  hopefully we can get a handle on the true impact of any sales soon.  \
by the way, i guess ken told someone today that we would make the numbers.  we need to be careful until we know what the numbers are.
 
are you around on wednesday?  we should talk about a few things.

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim
