are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they would net out post-petition fees  Our business people feel that we have used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense  An amount equivalent to the pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the pre-petition amounts   All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America   -----Original Message----- From 	Mark Ellenberg MarkEllenbergcwtcomENRON  Sent	Friday February 15 2002 822 AM  To	Nemec Gerald  Cc	melaniegrayweilcom davidwolnermanweilcom Mann Kay  Subject	Re FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services  He is wrong on just about every point  In the few instances where he has  stated correct legal principles he has misapplied them     the bankruptcy code expressly cuts off interest on unsecured claims as     of the petition date     refusing to act under the contract unless prepetition debt is paid is a     violation of the automatic stay  in this regard it should be noted     that obligations maturing postpetition are still prepetition debts to     the extent they arise from a prepetition contract such as here     both set off and recoupment require that there be a debt owed to the     debtor by the counterparty and a debt owed by the debtor to the     counterparty  here the unstated premise of centanas position is that     centanas obligation to return gas is a debt owed by it to to enron     this is wrong  centana is merely a bailee of the gas and its return     obligation is not a debt  this is clearly established in the cotton     warehouse cases i have previously sent you the cites for     section 365d3 on its face only applies to leases of nonresidential     real property  a gas storage agreement is obviously not such a lease     the court has already ruled that enron deserves time to determine     whether to assume or reject executory contracts  in addition the court     has ruled that parties to executory contracts are not entitled to relief     from the stay or adequate protection     centana should be placed on notice that they are violating the stay by     demanding prepetition debt and by refusing to turn over property of the     estate  this exposes them to a contempt citation and damages  we     should thank them for providing a smoking gun in the form of richards     e-mail  in addition they are in breach of contract for refusing to     comply with enrons withdrawal requests  this exposes them to breach of     contract damages claims based on the decline in the value of gas     they are entitled to be paid as an administrative expense for storage     charges based on storage actually used since december 2  you should be aware that we resolved a similar standoff with ngpl by  agreeing to immediately reject storage contracts and paying post-petition  administrative storage charges if they cooperated in the sale of gas to a  third party via in-ground transfer  maybe that would work here                      Nemec                      Gerald               To markellenbergcwtcom

  Nemec Gerald   Cc           Greg A Swidensky   Subject           Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services   Importance        High     Gerald this e-mail will serve as a follow-up to our telephone  conversation   from the other day  There are a number of arguments we believe we have   with respect to our entitlement to pre-bankruptcy lease payments under  our   storage lease with Enron    These arguments include our rights under our   storage lease agreement common law setoff rights recoupment   rejectionassumption and adequate protection  issues  These issues are   briefly addressed below        Under the terms of our September 1 2001 Gas Storage Agreement Enron  is      obligated to pay monthly interest in the amount of 15 for past due      lease obligations  Currently Enron is past due for both pre-and      post-bankruptcy lease obligations to us  Under the terms of the  lease      we are authorized to suspend withdrawals until all past due  obligations      including interest are paid      We believe that under Texas law we are entitled to common law  recoupment      andor setoff rights      We dont know whether Enron intends to accept or reject our storage      lease  If Enron rejects our 3 year lease we calculate the rejection      damages for anticipatory breach to exceed 36 million which is in      excess of the value of the gas  Recoupment rights are generally      available to determine a just liability on the claim of one party      against another with respect to a single indivisible contract      If recoupment is not available setoff enables us to  offset our  claims      under the lease against Enrons claims for the gas subject to the      automatic stay  because mutual debts may be offset against each other      to achieve a just result  Official Comm of Unsecured Creditors v      Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co In re Bennett Funding Group 146      F3rd 136 2nd Cir 1998      Section 365d3 of the Code requires that a debtor-in-possession      timely perform all of its obligations under an unexpired lease until  it      is assumed or rejected  Therefore not only rent but also other  fees      taxes and attorneys fees to the extent provided for under the  lease      must be paid under Section 365d3  Courts have held late charges  for      postpetition pre-rejection lease payments to be obligations that must      be paid as administrative expense claims  See eg In re MS Freight      Distribution Inc 172 BR 976 Bankr WD Wash 1994      We believe that we are entitled to the setting of an early deadline by      the court for Enron to determine whether or not to accept or reject  this      contract in order to protect our recoupmentsetoff rights and we  believe      we are entitled to relief from the automatic stay to permit the  exercise      of the setoff rights if recoupment should be found not to apply      Pending such determinations we believe that we are entitled to hold  the      gas to preserve our recoupmentsetoff rights  See eg Citizens  Bank      v Strumpf 516 US 16 1995     Our preference is to work out a deal with Enron for the purchase of this   gas with a credit against the purchase price for both pre- and post-  bankruptcy lease obligations  We believe we should seek bankruptcy court   approval to the extent this involves pre-bankruptcy obligations    This

9600 area If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade picture needs to change you may have heard the last utterance of anyone saying they want a strong USD The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was 1125 bln  So the US has to attract 3750 bln per month to keep this in balance   to do so either asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower  both is happening Well the US trade deficit is getting closer to 45  of GDP  Just the deficit and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit So the EUR just popped up over 9600 and a boatload of stops were just done into the 9625-30  And now will have settled in at 9610 There are no retracements in the EUR just quiet periods of consolidation Until we get a screaming need to own US equities there appears to be no need to own USD and no retracement of the EUR Japans trade surplus with the US 68 bln  The game continues USDYEN 12350 and no Bank of Japan I think it would not be in the best interest for the Japanese to be seen intervening right after this monster of a trade deficit Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715 yy Anything that climbs over 700  is not normal most of Japans trade surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626 But every month  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about 7 bln USD just to keep the YEN stable against the USD  as the current imbalance in trade creates pressures for a firmer YEN  Who knows maybe  a few voices in Asia could clamor  that the YEN is too weak Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over 400 bln these days and climbing I think 406 bln in April and 419 bln in May Maybe Japan will someday dollarize Canadas trade surplus with the world is up 110 to 52 bln Automotive exports the key  The CAD trade surplus with the US was 82 bln and a deficit with the rest of the world at 30 bln The US commerce department has the CAD surplus at 41 bln SGD at 17775 firmest level since last October Its moving on its own no sympathy move with the YEN so either the YEN has to play catch-up or the YEN is going to weaken against the rest of Asia Thai baht is also firm at 4200 against the USD  Korean won still at 1210 Asia definitely looks better with the US trade deficit Venezuelan bolivar a record low at 1305 to the USD since May 1 the VEB has devalued 52   Not much more to say Everyone have a great day the above thoughts are for your reading pleasure Any questions call me All the best This publication is for information only and the comments and forecasts are intended to be of a general nature as of the date of issue The above commentary is not to be construed as an offer to buy or sell investments American Express Bank Ltd whilst considering the contents to be reliable takes no responsibility for any individual investment decisions based thereon

News httpbizyahoocomnddnyhtml such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader The deep pockets of the second-largest US oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp Other OTC ENRNQPK httpfinanceyahoocomqsenrnqpkdt - News httpbizyahoocomneenrnqpkhtml ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place said Fadel Gheit an oil analyst at Fahnestock  Co After all this are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a vested interest in Dynegys success but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take The company owns 265 percent of Dynegy a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as 300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week even as US and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company Already Dynegys credit rating is in danger of falling to junk levels Credit rating agency Moodys Investors Service has put Dynegys credit rating in on review while rival credit agency Standard  Poors has placed Dynegys short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch If Dynegy is downgraded to junk theyll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco said Gene Gillespie an analyst with Howard Weil Labouisse Dynegy shares fell 57 cents or 58 percent to an almost three-year low of 931 ChevronTexacos stock has not been rocked by the power trading sectors woes Its shares rose 215 or 24 percent to 9010 BOARDS ROLE Dynegy is also the subject of several probes including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal Project Alpha that cut the companys tax bill by 80 million Another probe is looking into wash trades intended solely to boost trading volumes ChevronTexacos silence since Dynegys troubles have come to light has worried analysts When credit rating agency Standard  Poors placed Dynegys short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week it said it was concerned about the lack of any public statement of support from ChevronTexaco in this period of market tumult for Dynegy If the situation deteriorates I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy said James Elliot a portfolio manager with Dominick  Dominick Advisors Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegys board including Chief Financial Officer John Watson It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing said Gheit I hope not because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco He added that bailing out Dynegy would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco  Chevron acquired the stake in 1996 before its merger with Texaco when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp bought Chevrons natural gas business ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming 15 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegys planned purchase of Enron Additional reporting by Janet McGurty and Paul Thomasch in New York Email this story httprdyahoocomfinancenewsarticleemailhttpmtfnewsyahoocommailtourlhttpbizyahoocomrc020513utilitiesdynegychevrontexaco1htmltitleChevronTexaco20faces20tough20choices20on20Dynegy20stakepropfinancelocaleus -

Tuesday February 19 2002 1232 PM To Proctor Shemin V Mann Kay Cc markellenbergcwtcom Subject FW FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Kay  Mark is aware of this transaction  The following is his response to Centanas counsel email  I did discuss with Mark this morning the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they would net out post-petition fees  Our business people feel that we have used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense  An amount equivalent to the pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the pre-petition amounts   All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America   -----Original Message----- From 	Mark Ellenberg MarkEllenbergcwtcomENRON  Sent	Friday February 15 2002 822 AM  To	Nemec Gerald  Cc	melaniegrayweilcom davidwolnermanweilcom Mann Kay  Subject	Re FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services  He is wrong on just about every point  In the few instances where he has  stated correct legal principles he has misapplied them     the bankruptcy code expressly cuts off interest on unsecured claims as     of the petition date     refusing to act under the contract unless prepetition debt is paid is a     violation of the automatic stay  in this regard it should be noted     that obligations maturing postpetition are still prepetition debts to     the extent they arise from a prepetition contract such as here     both set off and recoupment require that there be a debt owed to the     debtor by the counterparty and a debt owed by the debtor to the     counterparty  here the unstated premise of centanas position is that     centanas obligation to return gas is a debt owed by it to to enron     this is wrong  centana is merely a bailee of the gas and its return     obligation is not a debt  this is clearly established in the cotton     warehouse cases i have previously sent you the cites for     section 365d3 on its face only applies to leases of nonresidential     real property  a gas storage agreement is obviously not such a lease     the court has already ruled that enron deserves time to determine     whether to assume or reject executory contracts  in addition the court     has ruled that parties to executory contracts are not entitled to relief     from the stay or adequate protection     centana should be placed on notice that they are violating the stay by     demanding prepetition debt and by refusing to turn over property of the     estate  this exposes them to a contempt citation and damages  we     should thank them for providing a smoking gun in the form of richards     e-mail  in addition they are in breach of contract for refusing to     comply with enrons withdrawal requests  this exposes them to breach of     contract damages claims based on the decline in the value of gas     they are entitled to be paid as an administrative expense for storage     charges based on storage actually used since december 2  you should be aware that we resolved a similar standoff with ngpl by  agreeing to immediately reject storage contracts and paying post-petition  administrative storage charges if they cooperated in the sale of gas to a  third party via in-ground transfer  maybe that would work here                      Nemec                      Gerald               To markellenbergcwtcom                      GeraldNemec        cc

 Subject           Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services   Importance        High     Gerald this e-mail will serve as a follow-up to our telephone  conversation   from the other day  There are a number of arguments we believe we have   with respect to our entitlement to pre-bankruptcy lease payments under  our   storage lease with Enron    These arguments include our rights under our   storage lease agreement common law setoff rights recoupment   rejectionassumption and adequate protection  issues  These issues are   briefly addressed below        Under the terms of our September 1 2001 Gas Storage Agreement Enron  is      obligated to pay monthly interest in the amount of 15 for past due      lease obligations  Currently Enron is past due for both pre-and      post-bankruptcy lease obligations to us  Under the terms of the  lease      we are authorized to suspend withdrawals until all past due  obligations      including interest are paid      We believe that under Texas law we are entitled to common law  recoupment      andor setoff rights      We dont know whether Enron intends to accept or reject our storage      lease  If Enron rejects our 3 year lease we calculate the rejection      damages for anticipatory breach to exceed 36 million which is in      excess of the value of the gas  Recoupment rights are generally      available to determine a just liability on the claim of one party      against another with respect to a single indivisible contract      If recoupment is not available setoff enables us to  offset our  claims      under the lease against Enrons claims for the gas subject to the      automatic stay  because mutual debts may be offset against each other      to achieve a just result  Official Comm of Unsecured Creditors v      Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co In re Bennett Funding Group 146      F3rd 136 2nd Cir 1998      Section 365d3 of the Code requires that a debtor-in-possession      timely perform all of its obligations under an unexpired lease until  it      is assumed or rejected  Therefore not only rent but also other  fees      taxes and attorneys fees to the extent provided for under the  lease      must be paid under Section 365d3  Courts have held late charges  for      postpetition pre-rejection lease payments to be obligations that must      be paid as administrative expense claims  See eg In re MS Freight      Distribution Inc 172 BR 976 Bankr WD Wash 1994      We believe that we are entitled to the setting of an early deadline by      the court for Enron to determine whether or not to accept or reject  this      contract in order to protect our recoupmentsetoff rights and we  believe      we are entitled to relief from the automatic stay to permit the  exercise      of the setoff rights if recoupment should be found not to apply      Pending such determinations we believe that we are entitled to hold  the      gas to preserve our recoupmentsetoff rights  See eg Citizens  Bank      v Strumpf 516 US 16 1995     Our preference is to work out a deal with Enron for the purchase of this   gas with a credit against the purchase price for both pre- and post-  bankruptcy lease obligations  We believe we should seek bankruptcy court   approval to the extent this involves pre-bankruptcy obligations    This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its

Reuters Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday send ing shares of independent producers and traders falling The downturn was t riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal WSJ of a financing arr angement used by Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN which prompted unwelcome compariso ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos NYSE WMB 20 Analysis Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th e recently hard-hit independent power producers IPPs more unwanted bad n ews has once again plagued this sector In addition to Dynegy and Williams companies such as Calpine Mirant and AES have had significant news in the past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los ses lowered credit ratings softening energy commodity prices and questio ns of accounting practices Lets take a look at the latest developments fo r these companies20 Dynegy shares closed at 2879 per share down by about 4 percent as the m arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegys use of off-balance-sheet transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c ash flow and net income Project Alpha as it was called was blessed by Dy negys former auditor Andersen and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers  Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of business practices that Enron engaged in Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph asized The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w ith a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit  Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved Dynegy sto ck was not used to back the loans and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn egys financial reports last year In 2000 the company reported unrealized gains of 354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts increasi ng the gap between its profit and cash flow Trading companies include the  estimated value for derivative contracts they use for future buying and s elling of commodities in net income as unrealized gains A special purpos e entity SPE was formed in April of last year with a 300-million loan fr om Citigroup Inc The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called DMT Supply LP in which Dynegy held a stake According to Dynegy during t he first nine months of operation DMT bought gas from the entity at below-market prices and resold the gas at a profit But during future years of th e project scheduled to end in 2006 DMT will buy gas at above-market gas pr ices generating unrealized losses By arranging transactions in this manne r Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by 80 million But according to WSJ higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho se assigned to cash transactions which creates a disconnect between repor ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice20 Williams shares also dropped by 45 percent on Wednesday to close at 2308 per share on news from WSJ which reported that the SEC is looking into th e companys third-quarter results In reaction Williams clarified that it  had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform ation concerning the companys 2001 third-quarter results but was told afte r a review that no financial adjustments were needed Williams spokesperso n Jim Gipson said We received an informal confidential request for infor mation by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q They asked a couple of questions we responded in writing they called back in seven  days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required Gips on emphasized that We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t he SEC Williams reported a third-quarter net income of 2213 million up from 1765 million or 27 cents a share earned in the same quarter one y ear ago The quarter included a one-time charge of 71 million for the comp anys investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group On Mar ch 7 Williams announced it had taken a 21-billion charge in the fourth q uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications  Williams reported a loss of 4777 million for the fourth quarter20 Calpine shares were down 626 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n ews that Moodys had downgraded Calpines unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1 al ong with a negative ratings outlook Approximately 124 billion of long-te rm debt instruments are affected This follows a March 29 report when the  company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company disc overed that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not  actually available In a press release Calpine said 2001 earnings would be lowered by 115 million after tax from the 6596 million reported on Jan  31 The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extra ordinary items by 3 cents a share to 18720 Moodys sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine s high leverage limited financial flexibility and substantial ongoing cap ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program Ca lpines debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin ues its development of committed projects While Calpines total electric s ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants it is expe cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions Moodys anticipated  that lower spark spreads the difference between electric and fuel prices  will lower in the near term Moodys warned that the negative outlook refle cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpines liquidity pos ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations Calpine plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expa nsions during 2002 and 2003 Moodys also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine s 2 billion of senior secured credit facilities According to Moodys the Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpines collateral p ackage A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpines equity in terests in Saltend and nine US power plants A principal part of the coll ateral package is Calpines natural-gas properties which may be subject to fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices Moodys  claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven20 Mirant also continues to experience hard times Its shares were down 621 p ercent to close at 1360 per share Although yesterdays downturn may have largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector Mirant has been involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to try to shore up its balance sheet On April 1 it was reported that Mirant  has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl and up for sale Queenslands government-owned CS Energy currently 40-perc ent owner of Kogan Creek is reported to be a potential buyer as are MIM a nd Macarthur Coal In a separate transaction announced on March 27 Cleco a greed to buy Mirants 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the companies are building in northeastern Louisiana The merchant power plant is owned by a joint venture between the two companies Cleco said it would assume Mirants 195-million equity commitment and pay 48 million to ret ire Mirants project debt Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co mbination of new common stock and debt20 AES has also fallen on tough times Although the companys stock was up yes terday to close at 896 per share the company continues to struggle Earl y this week AES sent a shockwave through the UK market when it announced its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant locate d in Wales into receivership The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 w as funded with a 2145-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche  Bank Richard Hill joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London who is charged with selling the asset says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non -recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet  to be fully determined Similar to the US market wholesale prices in the UK reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spri ngs new bilateral trading system Accordingly one report claims at least  a dozen project loans are either in technical default have broken their co venants or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio20 In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purch asing AESGeners 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion de Energia Electrica Sigen services company for an undisclosed amount G E already owned 60 percent of the joint venture AESGener controlled by AE S posted losses of Pesos 5027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos  2275mil in 2000 Operating results were down by 125 percent to Pesos 70 241mil on sales declining 238 percent to Pesos 347009mil The performanc e of AES Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes and selling o ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses Rece ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company  will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chil e20 The fallout of the Enron debacle lowered credit ratings and weak commodit y prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the r opes struggling to make the bell The companies are aggressively working to put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales p ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs But as qui ckly as these companies fortunes have nosedived they can rise once again Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world20 An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom httpsecurescientechcomissuealert20  20 I am an avid fan of your

Legal Opinion My view is that we cannot return this without court approval  I assume that the funds paid into Company 1647 HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept into Enron Corps centralized cash accounts  Given the cumulative size of these payments I dont think we should go forward without court apporval Also a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp  I wouldnt want to allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started In addition are we certain that Exxon doesnt owe ENA or Corp any amounts due and owing  If it does I think that further complicates the analysis Brian if you disagree let me know but as it stands we would need court approval to return these funds  Thanks Gray Barbara N BarbaraNGrayENRONcom on 02202002 041453 PM cc    Denetsosie Troy TroyDenetsosieENRONcom Subject    FW AEP Refunds -

package from us so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package Were there just certain products you were using For example our basic package which includes the 1-15 day maps the 16-city forecasts the 30-day outlook and phone access is 450month The noon update would be an additional 150month Since you are a smaller group I can apply a discount as wellperhaps as much as 20 Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put together a package and quote for you fairly quickly Im attaching our standard price sheet for your reference as well Take care Matt Rogers Energy
