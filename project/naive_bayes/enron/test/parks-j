Gentlemen,

Attached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the Texas book.  We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing.  Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps.

Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.  Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.

Louis, I, for now, have requested wholesale basis positions(price equivalent) be keep out of the price report. Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained in the price report. I would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price.

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.

Subject: Centana Transaction


Gerald/Chip,

Could you tell me how to proceed on this deal.  This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.

By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).

The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.

Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

Please advise at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

Chip - please put the following transaction in front of the Cash Committee for approval.  As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.
 
As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.  
 
Call with questions.

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

 <<Redline_.rtf>> 
Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
taking "let me see it and I'll let you know" approach so let me know if
you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.

Subject:	DEC. MRT GAS



ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

T
he first detailed allegations that Enron
abused mark-to-market accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided
by a professor and former deriva-tives
trader who reviewed the Enron case
for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
Those charges, along with allega-tions
that have surfaced that mark-to-market
accounting was misused by Enron
Energy Services, the company's retail
energy and services unit, are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemak-ers
for much more disclosure on mark-to-market
accounting practices and the
impact of mark-to-market accounting on
earnings trading firms' earnings.
In testimony Thursday before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty
of San Diego Law School, said it
appears that Enron traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements.
"In a nutshell, it appears that some
Enron employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate
false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives
Enron traded," said Partnoy, who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committee's request. "It appears that Enron
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves, typically in order to hide losses."
"Traders are compensated based on
their profits," he observed, "so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves, he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus."
Partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem.
"For each trade," he testified, "a
trader would report either a profit or loss,
typically in spreadsheet format. These
profit-and-loss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality. Frequently they
did not. Instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column, some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns. The first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent
financial statements. The second col-umn,
ironically labeled the 'prudency'
reserve, included the remainder."
Partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation, "Enron's 'prudency'
reserves did not depict economic reality,
nor could they have been intended to do
so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time. The portion of prof-its
recorded as 'prudency' could be used
to offset any future losses," he said.
He recommended that investigators
question Enron employees who were
involved in these transactions "to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete."

Joe,

Take a look at the mini-dash I've thrown together.  Let me know what comments or corrections you have.  I want to get this to Stuart for his approval this evening so we can have it teed up for tomorrow morning.  The attached is just the verbage, but I think it may make sense to attach your spreadsheet and possibly some support for our Bridgeline valuation as appendices.

Thanks,
Jon

Thought you would find this guy's FX write-up interesting today...

 

From: Michael F McGuinness on 06/20/2002 10:09 AM

 

 

Simple thoughts.....

 

US assets get sold... (mostly equities).... and then the USD is sold.....

 

It's not the other way around.

 

The world is losing confidence.  Everyday we get more terrorist activity around

the world. (sorry Reuters.... it's terrorism....)

 

 Uncertainty is higher...... Risk is higher...... People around the world want

their money close to home. So off they go to sell their investments here in the

States, sell the USD and buy their home currency.

 

US April trade deficit came in at $35.94 bln..... a record. Here's the part

that's amazing..... the trade imbalance in goods.... US deficit in goods

only.... $39.92 bln..... $40 bln goods imbalance in just one month....

 

And where are we importing from.....

 

China.... $7.55 bln and this is a natural phenomena since about any product

sold these days under $100 in the US these days is made in China......

compliments from Mark....  China has a competitive advantage, and trade rules

will dictate that goods will originate from China until the cost structure

adjusts...... say in 25 years......

 

Western Europe...... $7.244 bln..... yeah the standard of living in Europe must

be the same as China....... with higher short term rates in Europe..... growth

in many industries in Europe is from the US. How can anybody in Brussels think

that a trade surplus with the US almost equal to China's (and one that is

larger than Japan's...) is a proper economic condition.......   As I said on

Tuesday.... I believe that the purchasing power parity level for the EUR is up

over $1.0800. (this is based on some long term thoughts.... that the old DEM

for PPP was 1.80 against the USD....)

 

The EUR is undervalued by 12.5%. That's why I think it's funny that European

politicians and the press feel that the EUR is strong up here the .9500 - .9600

area.

 

If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade

picture needs to change...... you may have heard the last utterance of anyone

saying they want a strong USD.......

 

The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was $112.5 bln....  So the US has to

attract $37.50 bln per month to keep this in balance......   to do so either

asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower......  both is

happening.....

 

Well, the US trade deficit is getting closer to 4.5%  of GDP.  Just the

deficit.... and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit.......

 

So the EUR just popped up over .9600 and a boatload of stops were just done

into the .9625-30.  And now will have settled in at .9610. There are no

retracements in the EUR, just quiet periods of consolidation.

 

Until we get a screaming need to own US equities..... there appears to be no

need to own USD, and no retracement of the EUR.

 

Japan's trade surplus with the US..... $6.8 bln.  The game continues.....

USD/YEN 123.50 and no Bank of Japan...... I think, it would not be in the best

interest for the Japanese to be seen intervening right after this monster of a

trade deficit.

 

Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715% y/y.......

Anything that climbs over 700 % is not normal...... most of Japan's trade

surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626%......

 

But every month,  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about $7 bln USD

just to keep the YEN stable against the USD,  as the current imbalance in trade

creates pressures for a firmer YEN.......  Who knows, maybe  a few voices in

Asia could clamor....  that the YEN is too weak.....

 

Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over $400 bln these days and climbing,

(I think $406 bln in April and $419 bln in May)........ Maybe Japan will

someday dollarize........

 

Canada's trade surplus with the world is up 11.0% to $5.2 bln. Automotive

exports... the key.  The CAD trade surplus with the US was $8.2 bln and a

deficit with the rest of the world at $3.0 bln. (The US commerce department has

the CAD surplus at $4.1 bln....)

 

SGD at 1.7775.... firmest level since last October. It's moving on it's own, no

sympathy move with the YEN.... so either the YEN has to play catch-up or the

YEN is going to weaken against the rest of Asia....

 

Thai baht is also firm at 42.00 against the USD.  Korean won still at 1210.

Asia definitely looks better with the US trade deficit.

 

Venezuelan bolivar a record low at 1305 to the USD, since May 1 the VEB has

devalued 52%.   Not much more to say.....

 

Everyone have a great day....... the above thoughts are for your reading

pleasure. Any questions call me. All the best.

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

$1000 (per couple) not including food.  Our thought are to leave on June 13
and return on June 16 so we would be there over our anniversary.  I am

THIS IS AN INTEREST STATEMENT "foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?"

Subject: Flows


In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

(NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader. 

	

The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall. 

But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>) 

"ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place," said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. "After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?" 

San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a "vested interest" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November. 

Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company. 

Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to "junk" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch. 

"If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco," said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse. 

Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10. 

BOARD'S ROLE 

Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, "Project Alpha," that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into "wash trades" intended solely to boost trading volumes. 

ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts. 

When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was "concerned about the lack of any public statement of support" from ChevronTexaco "in this period of market tumult" for Dynegy. 

"If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy," said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors. 

Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson. 

"It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing," said Gheit. "I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco." 

He added that bailing out Dynegy "would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco ." 

Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business. 

ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.

Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my "in box". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying "thanks".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

Spoke with Chance on friday, he believes that the wholesale data is clean. I also sent an email to Chance, Pat and Scott that raised the issue of PV'ed positions. I am waiting for a response. 
 
I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts. I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas. Any questions give me a shout.
Joe

Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet. 

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?): 
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  

2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis. 

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Thanks

Attached is the information that we discussed last evening. 

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index. 
        The tabs that indicate "OXY II Only" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.

        The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity. 

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

Ed, 
Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. Who would you like for me to hand these over to?
Duke/Centana 
Money wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 
Ponderosa Energy Partners 
I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over. I  recommend Chris to help manage this, if that works for you.
Pace Energy 
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000. 
General Land Office. 
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal deal sheet for the natural gas volumes.

I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen =
that 10 point I shot "on the hoof", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out low=
er jaw for inspection, you would have said "Damn, that's an old deer."=20
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler form=
ation (9" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2=
, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had=
 about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass w=
as more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by=
 side, the younger one looked like a "thoroughbread Horse", while mine look=
ed like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think t=
hat we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria tog=
ether about what "formula" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say t=
hat My 10 point was "Mature and on his way down" while the young one (Same =
deer that Keith has seen, too) is "Mature and on his way up". The last thin=
g I have to say about that was that the "Young" deer of the two was definit=
ely the "dominant" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my "ol' ba=
stard" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was pass=
ed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older =
one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger =
sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to "pour the Chili" =
while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the "stud", =
ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stu=
d, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anyth=
ing. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a=
 Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and=
 doesn't "disappear" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from =
year to year.=20

THIS IS AN INTEREST STATEMENT "foreigners want to add to their holdings of
US assets when they already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of
corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?"

Subject: Flows


In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 
Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.

Joe,
I spoke with Centana's attorney. According to him, they are not opposed
to the escrow account, just the hassle of paper work, but he is checking
with his commercial person and will get back to me today. I told him ENA
wants to do the deal, ENA is willing to open the escrow account, but
that's the deal. So I expect to hear from him shortly.

Attached is the email from Centana's attorney. At the very beginning of
Mike Richards' email he lists all of his claims.

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.  

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.

Subject:	Bridgeline Working Gas

Spoke with Joe Parks this p.m.  Bridgeline will require gas retention to cover December and January storage and transport fees (approx. $1.32 million).  Assuming a $2.35 fixed price for the gas, we should be able to liquidate a little better than 1 Bcf.  It will take (at most) 9 days to withdrawal given our firm withdrawal rights of 150,000 MMBtu/d.  The storage contract has interruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.

Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Agreement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the event the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it across the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transport fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.

Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail which stated "he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald."  

Questions:
1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter?
2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?

Let me know.

Paul
	Paul, thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other nice people over there this afternoon. They seem like a great group to work with. The position sounds very interesting and like it would be a good opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out. Again, I really appreciate your efforts.


Thanks
Joe

Tom, 

How was holiday? It was nice spending time with the family for the holidays. The kids had a great time. When you get a minute, could you get Donnie's phone number at prebon, and Missy's number at APB, I would appreciate it.

Thanks

Joe

Subject: Deer Lease Report

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

e.

Gentlemen,
 
 
            Please access www.mertzranch.com <http://www.mertzranch.com/> and witness my photographic skills and Joe's obvious hunting skills as a picture of Joe's 9 point is being proudly displayed on Michael's web-site!!!! Methinks using Joe's deer and my photographical skills as a shameless plug for Michaels ever expanding  Outfitting Monopoly?.should grant us (hunter and photographer) certain royalties normally associated with this sort of unlicensed usage of this form of media. Basically, we need a price break for use of picture!!!! Anyway, pretty cool seeing your very own photo displayed on a website!!!!

Subject: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT


Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and "grapes" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for
being most "in" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

 <<IENER010702BSOW.PDF>>

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 01/07/02.

Recent energy investment sentiment could be characterized as a fear-driven,
cautious psychology that has led to a generally under-owned condition for
most energy stocks.  A major contributor to this negative psychology has
been the underlying belief of investors that "energy stocks always bottom
several times before a sustained upward move."  While that was true in the
1998/1999 downturn, we are convinced that today's energy fundamentals are
far different than those experienced in the downturn several years ago.  In
fact, we believe today's environment is much more similar to that
experienced in the 1972/1974 timeframe, when energy stocks experienced a
two-year run-up followed by a recession and subsequent nine month sell off.
In the 1974 downturn, however, the stocks experienced one bottom in the
late fall and never looked back.  Likewise, we are convinced that energy
stocks have already seen their lowest levels and as strong commodity
fundamentals become visible later in the first quarter, the stocks will
begin to run.  In other words, we believe the energy stocks are near the
bottom of a cyclical downturn within what we believe is going to be a
longer-term secular upswing.  That means that now is the time to be buying
energy stocks!

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Lets use whatever bank is easier. Wish me luck on finding someone else to buy this gas. Lets hope we don't have to go that route.

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

Yes, in harris county, looking to put a coffee stand in the new county court building/law center. They have no concessions. By the way, how are you and the family?

You're talking about Harris County not Cook County I assume. What kind of concession stand?

Who do you think I would need to call about setting up a concession stand in a county building? "The county" is not an appropriate response.

We're finalizing our Mini-Dash for Bridgeline and would like to have the latest gas prices.  Could you update the numbers you sent me?  I need just the nymex strip (April-September) and I can drop it into the document.

Thanks,

Joe-

I spoke to legal.  Other than the non-solicitation agreements some former employees may have signed companies have not been informed that they may not hire Enron employees.  Particularly in the case where an employee seeks out employment with another company the other company is in no way liable for speaking to or employing that employee as long as the employee is not under an employment contract.

FYI

Joe Parks just completed the sale of the gas in storage at the Centana Facility.  Below you will see confirmation of our receipt of the sales price.  Joe will send to me (and I can forward to any interested party) the methodology for the sales price calculation.  Of this amount, approximately $225,000 will be escrowed (these are for pre-petition obligations under the storage agreement with Centana) subject to some future resolution.  My understanding is that Ed McMichael and his team will be evaluating what to do with the Centana Storage Agreement (accept or reject).

Ed,wants me to get this deal closed. I spoke with Stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the MRT gas. He seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ENA is counterparty to both. Of course we would need to add language that would require Centana to show that it has paid Duke Field. Lets Discuss.

Technology is not quite where it needs to be yet. I s/b able to simply think
about moving $$ and making an investment, as I don't seem to have time these
days to get online and do it!  I just watch the virtual gains slip away...

By the way, I'm still looking to get out to KC this weekend, but I can't
seem to figure out what the weather is going to do.  The San Antonio
forecast looks different than KC's, so I can't tell what the chances of rain
are on Friday and Saturday.  Want to make sure it's worth while.  What do
the "models" say?

Of course, if you don't go, I'll probably blow it off anyway (no pressure).

Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet.

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?):
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  
2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis.

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Thanks

Attached is the information that we discussed last evening.

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index.
	The tabs that indicate "OXY II Only" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
	The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity.

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.



2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.



3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.



4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.



5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. "Dante's 4th Circle of Hell." You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.



6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the "Infinite Nutsmacker"You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp "Ready to Rock" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your "hello kitty" pajamas.....

Shemin, attached below is your last draft of the letter agreement with our
additional comments.  Some of the comments we previously discussed on the
phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron
management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out
of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional
changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood
that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

By the way, I'm still looking to get out to KC this weekend, but I can't
seem to figure out what the weather is going to do.  The San Antonio
forecast looks different than KC's, so I can't tell what the chances of
rain
are on Friday and Saturday.  Want to make sure it's worth while.  What

Of course, if you don't go, I'll probably blow it off anyway (no

Doug, 

Are the cash committee's activities in some way monitored by the court?  If so, then we can likely proceed with the payment.  If not, how do we proceed in the manner proposed below?  I will work with accounting to determine if there are any offsetting liabilities.

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

Daily Market Commentary October 25, 2001

TRADERS SKEWER ENRON . . .

 Natural gas futures retreated in busy trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Much of the volatility was the result of trade and commercial accounts seeking to profit from a perception of market weakness by a prominent trade and commercial account. Other trade and commercial players bid the cash market higher with the intent of forcing liquidation of underwater short positions. Today's activity is not seen as significant in the determination of longer term price trends, and short term traders see the market working higher. . .
 
 At the end of the day, the November futures fell $.043 to $2.938 per MMBtu. The December contract eased $.068 to $3.103 per MMBtu. . .

 "This was called the 'get Enron day'. Many customers said that Enron was short the market and at first traders ran the cash market higher. For a while the cash market was ahead of the futures by as much as 10 cents, and as soon as the gap was (partially) filled on the December charts at $3.25 to $3.30 (August 24), the bottom dropped out and when prices fell below unchanged, it got ugly," said a New York floor trader. . .

 "Basically Enron was taken to the cleaners. Traders knew that Enron had to get out of positions. There was talk of funds needed to pay an SEC fine, and
traders took advantage of that." . .

 "There was no sympathy for Enron anywhere. Traders knew they had them on the run." . . 

 "I believe if prices can hold the $2.80 to $2.82 in the November, the best
plan is to come back and buy again," he said. . .

 "The activity today was just a 'get Enron' tactic. Other traders were hearing the same thing from their customers."

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 5/28/2002.

Over the past several weeks, numerous analysts' reports have suggested
there has been a massive destruction of gas demand, as gas prices have
recently moved above $3.50/mcf. We believe the foundation for many of these
reports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that
weather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day
implies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001,
when prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching
incentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic
incentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down
plants in an improving economic environment. The current economy is very
different than the deteriorating economic environment in early 2001.

When: Thursday 2/28 at 7:15 pm.
 
We will wait until Zander is able to attend, to try the Tampico place. Would rather go w/ someone who knows the drill.

Had a nice weekend with the family down at KC.
Wrapped up a deposition in San Antonio at at about 1, eat and headed to KC. 
Arrived at about 4. shot limit at 100 acres. Not alot of birds, but enough. 
Birds very wise. Had to hide well. Lots of birds across the road feeding in 
the field, lots hanging out on wire. few moving over our ponds.
Saw lots of coyotes. 4 at 100acres, two at 500.
heavy rain at 7 pm. cool front.
Sheila came down with boys on sat. caught a few fish at 100 acres, shot 7 
birds. Suprised many still in area with rain and north wind. Harder to hide 
with two wiggling boys.
Never got to scout 500 acres, by mark hunted it last weekend according to 
his note and shot only two birds. I saw a decent number in the area of 
between our gate and road to Opiela's house. The field across the road from 
the front gate is stacked with sunfowers. They have not dropped seed yet, 
still yellow. in a week or so, could draw birds. still lots feeding across 
road from 100 acres.
John, saw a few deer tracks around your feeders, and lots of really big pig 
tracks.
If someone is going down in the next two weeks, please let me know. I left a

pistol at the house, Ms. Opiela went over and got it for me. She will hold 
onto it until I can get some one to pick it up.

Subject: Deer Lease Report

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

My Uncle lives an "alternative lifestyle" as well...I really don't much being around him either, but its not b/c of his sexual orientation, or lack there-of. I would enjoy consensus for once, however...

I love long walks in the woods, riding in your pickup truck,

Men:

The dreaded time has come. Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.

In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last 
hunting season.

I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.

Erik.

Spoke with my contact at TXU. She said we should speak with Jerry Burt ( head of credit 214-875-9350 ) about getting payment directed to the appropriate accounts. However, he will be out of the office until Wednesday.

I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?

Joe

[News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an=
d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, send=
ing shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was t=
riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arr=
angement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome compariso=
ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB).=
=20

Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th=
e recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad n=
ews has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams,=
 companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the=
 past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los=
ses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questio=
ns of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments fo=
r these companies.=20

Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the m=
arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet=
 transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c=
ash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dy=
negy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers=
. Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of=
 business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph=
asized, "The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w=
ith a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit=
." Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy sto=
ck was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn=
egy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported "unrealized=
 gains" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasi=
ng the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the =
estimated value for "derivative" contracts they use for future buying and s=
elling of commodities in net income as "unrealized gains." A special purpos=
e entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan fr=
om Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called=
 DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during t=
he first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-=
market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of th=
e project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas pr=
ices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manne=
r, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according=
 to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho=
se assigned to cash transactions which creates a "disconnect" between repor=
ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice.=20

Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08=
 per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into th=
e company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it =
had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform=
ation concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told afte=
r a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperso=
n Jim Gipson said, "We received an informal, confidential request for infor=
mation by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked=
 a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven =
days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required." Gips=
on emphasized that, "We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t=
he SEC." Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up=
 from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one y=
ear ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the comp=
any's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On Mar=
ch 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth q=
uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. =
Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter.=20

Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n=
ews that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, al=
ong with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-te=
rm debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the =
company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company disc=
overed that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not =
actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be=
 lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan=
. 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extra=
ordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87.=20

Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine'=
s high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing cap=
ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Ca=
lpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin=
ues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric s=
ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expe=
cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated =
that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) =
will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook refle=
cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity pos=
ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine=
 plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expa=
nsions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine'=
s $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the=
 Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral p=
ackage. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity in=
terests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the coll=
ateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to=
 fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's =
claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven.=20

Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 p=
ercent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have=
 largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been=
 involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to=
 try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant =
has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl=
and up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-perc=
ent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM a=
nd Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco a=
greed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the=
 companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant=
 is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would=
 assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to ret=
ire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co=
mbination of new common stock and debt.=20

AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yes=
terday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Earl=
y this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced=
 its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant locate=
d in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 w=
as funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche =
Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is=
 charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non=
-recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet =
to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the=
 U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spri=
ng's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least =
a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their co=
venants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio.=20

In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purch=
asing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion=
 de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. G=
E already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AE=
S, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $=
2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,=
241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performanc=
e of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling o=
ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Rece=
ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company =
will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chil=
e.=20

The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodit=
y prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the r=
opes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to=
 put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, p=
ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as qui=
ckly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again.=
 Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.=20

Executive Search Partners Inc.

 

 

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I appreciate the opportunity to introduce myself to you.  As you are well aware, a quality recruiter can be an invaluable resource to you, especially with the current state of energy industry.

 

Executive Search Partners, Inc. provides national recruiting services across diverse business sectors. I specialize in the placement of Traders and Risk Management positions within the financial services and energy industries. Having spent over 15 years in the trading profession, including a position as one of the top Head Long Treasury Traders for Merrill Lynch Canada and an owner-operator of a Commodities Trading Company, I know the industry and am qualified to assist you in your job search. The relationships with my client firms in the energy industry have helped me successfully place candidates at all levels in the risk area. 

 

We understand the need to receive proper representation from your recruiter as it is a reflection of you in your job search.  With intensive and daily exposure to the market, we seek potential job opportunities and most often know of positions before they're posted. By analyzing your own needs and objectives, career goals and philosophy, we develop with you a target profile for an ideal company and position.  Candidates have found that having us assist during final discussions and negotiations with the prospective company provides them third party sensitivity and objectivity, so often necessary to close the deal.

 

Our proven methods for helping people will give you a step up on other candidates in this ever-changing market, where time and timing are everything. As someone that knows and understands your business, I feel strongly that I am qualified to help you. I look forward to working with you to explore job opportunities that can enhance your career.

 

Sincerely,

Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?
 
If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.
 
Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?
 
Chad, the time in the "stall" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

How about this?  It may be too formal, but I don't know how well you know
this guy.  Call me before you send it.

Paul,

Thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other
nice people over there this afternoon.  They seem like a great group to work
with.  The position sounds very interesting and like it would be a good
opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out.  Again, I really
appreciate your efforts.  

Joe

Gentlemen,
 
 
            Please access www.mertzranch.com <http://www.mertzranch.com/> and witness my photographic skills and Joe's obvious hunting skills as a picture of Joe's 9 point is being proudly displayed on Michael's web-site!!!! Methinks using Joe's deer and my photographical skills as a shameless plug for Michaels ever expanding  Outfitting Monopoly?.should grant us (hunter and photographer) certain royalties normally associated with this sort of unlicensed usage of this form of media. Basically, we need a price break for use of picture!!!! Anyway, pretty cool seeing your very own photo displayed on a website!!!!

Could you please get 3 broker quotes for the volumes & locations in the spreadsheet below ?

We need the quotes for the purposes of validating our internal curves and making E&Y more comfortable with our OXY valuation.

Thank You.

Subject: Enemy Lawyers Struck Down Once Again


The Lord works in wonderful ways.
My dear opposing counsel failed to appear at docket call this morning for 
our December 3rd, 2001 trial setting on the case you have heard me talk 
about so much.
The court dismissed their case for want of prosecution on the spot for no 
showing. While they have 30 days to try to get the case reinstated, the 
bottom line is that I will not have trial looming over my head while we hunt 
and you will not have to listen to me drone on about this ridiculous case 
(unless you want me to and at least for now).
Sincerely, Lawyer Boy.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.

Subject:	Centana

Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the 
Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next 
morning. 21" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed 
that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to 
fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have 
lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

It all should work fine now. Sorry for the confusion on our part.

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

www.earthsat.com/misc/bridgeline

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail
if you have any problems with the website.

The webmaster is Darren Prager (dprager@earthsat.com).

Thanks again!!

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

Matt,


My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks


Greg Schockling

ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

Joe,

The guys who teach auto for us said that if I do have to go with gas,
that the 502 is a much "healthier" engine than the 454.  Any idea of the
cost of 502's?

Thanks

These are your cost.

Here is a response from Shemin regarding the gas that we received on MRT from Duke Field Services. I would like to know if I can seek the necessary approvals to pay Duke for the volumes.

Thanks

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 3/25/2002.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are
scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be
volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only
sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what
happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that
U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter
than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the
extent of this tightness, as more "normal" weather over the past several
weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.
This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into
the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas
injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be
the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.

Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary
numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to
surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice, we
can steal some of Henry's.

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

www.earthsat.com/misc/bridgeline

login: bridge
password: cajun

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail
if you have any problems with the website.

The webmaster is Darren Prager (dprager@earthsat.com).

Thanks again!!

Matt

The contract looks fine, my only question is do we have to wait till the
20th to get web access?  Just explain to me when we can begin receiving the
service.

Good afternoon. I'm attaching a contract agreement, which includes a
discount for the smaller number of users. Please let me know if you have any
questions or concerns regarding the contract.  Otherwise, please sign and
fax back to (301)231-5246 or 5020 at your earliest convenience.

Thanks again!

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Matt

Matt,

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

Matt,


My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks


Greg Schockling

There is another list, one that reflects traders bonus.  Rumors were that it was 800K average, 60MM disbursement.  It was ear tagged via Dynegy merger announcement, hence it didn't hit press.
