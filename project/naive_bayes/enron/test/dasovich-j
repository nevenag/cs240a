Californias malaise deepens Gray Davis standing plummets Published Oct 7 2001 A year ago Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo Davis high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings Today a dark cloud has descended on the state A sharp decline in the economy particularly high-tech sectors a stubborn energy crisis and most recently the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security and theyre looking for someone to blame Davis approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation And they have continued to sag thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months The seriousness of Davis decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that at the moment most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis Davis chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings State tax revenues are in a nosedive running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups How big the state budget hole will become is anyones guess Theres a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project Some analysts believe that Davis problem could rival the 14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991 Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history However large the states fiscal problem may be it will be much much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue And the 125 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administrations demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review Its apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive which is why Davis own appointees to the PUC are balking Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place Or he could accept the Legislatures proposal contained in legislation on his desk that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities purchases must receive But Davis is insisting that hell veto the measure The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts as well as Davis months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game will undermine the governors claim for a second term He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting That and Californians increasing apprehension about their future will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned The Bees Dan Walters can be reached at 916 321-1195

has been discussing the prospects of state agencies eg the CEC pursuing a long-term 1-2 year strategy of re-introducing centralized Integrated Resource Planning in California  Indeed some CEC staff have used sought to obtain planningmodelling authorities that could lead to dispatch instructions or perhaps identification of generation units for retirement The CPUC is opening a rulemaking OIR to return to integrated resource planning  The BRPU returns  Anyway we will be discussing this further at the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes available -----Original Message-----From Andy Brown mailtoabbeslawfirmcom Sent Thursday October 25 2001 1036 AM To Steven Kelly doug kerner Jan Smutny-Jones Subject highlights from CPUC meeting Importance High FYI  Highlights from todays CPUC meeting  It is still in progress with few energy items remaining  Regular results memo to follow CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to integrated resource planning with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update BRPU proceeding  Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options including new asset construction power purchase agreements conservation transmission etc CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes lines to NV AZ and MX  Will begin new phase re economic projects CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge ALJ ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts  CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes but that they must move forward on ordinary review process  This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCEs CPUC rejects PGEs call for market valuation of retained generation PGE argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates  CPUC rejects argument  Duque will concur but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets and fact that PGE still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation  It is also unclear notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement --Andrew Brown Sacramento CA andybrwnearthlinknet

Richter Jeff Parquet David Subject	Californias 125 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged Official Says DWR Contract Renegotiation Is Key Californias 125 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged Official Says Sacramento California Oct 10 Bloomberg -- Californias 125 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts a state regulatory official said The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the states power costs using utility rates The commissioners favor another approach opposed by Davis that would give them more authority over the states 43 billion of power contracts Some commissioners would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governors part to renegotiate those contracts said Geoffrey Brown who was appointed to the PUC by Davis Were not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall Theres got to be some give here Moodys Investors Service on Friday said Californias 316 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year in part because of the delayed bond sale Californias budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach 93 billion if energy costs arent repaid state Treasurer Philip Angelides said The state has spent 104 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PGE Corp and Edison International utilities which are insolvent Davis Willing to Discuss It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman Davis will consider Browns offer especially in context of any refunds from generators that may be ordered Maviglio said State officials claim power generators have charged too much and are asking federal regulators to order refunds Power generators are willing to discuss it but I wouldnt want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum a group representing power sellers Any companies willing to talk might want something else in return and who knows what that might be The planned bond sale the largest municipal debt sale in US history would repay the states general fund for a 61 billion power loan and cover other power costs The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders A Blank Check Under state law the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts The Department of Water Resources the state agency buying the power has sole authority to determine its revenue needs PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts They also said the DWR has been given too much authority In the past the PUC has set utility rates It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers bills The proposal would let the PUC review the water departments revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities Davis opposes that plan Its dead on arrival Its still going to be vetoed said Maviglio The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims the governors office said in a statement last week The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds Making a change now would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied the governors office said in the statement Critics of the long-term power contracts say the states economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come No matter which approach the state takes the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway Burton said And some of the generators have said theyre willing to do it

which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators all of which were to attend th e meeting20 Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu res of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine mont hs are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st ructure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to dev elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and pr ocedures20 ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC20 The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines wh ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from 20 If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an au dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated  the market Wolfmans office said20 As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud it of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement  division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could  lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated20 The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po wer first20 The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe r at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the  second letter says20 The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and decl ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays me eting20 Generators Confused20 Generators including Mirant Corp  MIR httpquickenexcitecominvestm entsquotessymbol3DMIR news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnew ssymbol3DMIR msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymb ol3DMIR Reliant Energy Inc  REI httpquickenexcitecominvestment squotessymbol3DREI news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnews symbol3DREI msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol 3DREI Williams Cos  WMB httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotes symbol3DWMB news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol 3DWMB msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DWMB  Duke Energy  DUK httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol 3DDUK news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DDUK m sgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DDUK and Dyne gy Inc  DYN httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3DDYN news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DDYN msgs htt pquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DDYN have bought app arently inexpensive power in the ISOs spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher Thats because according to the allegatio ns the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as out-o f-market purchases that arent averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see20 DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISOs request DW R operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs long-term contracts20 The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive however According to t he ISOs August market report the average out-of-market price for peak hou rs was 5590 a megawatt-hour compared with 2649MWh on the ISO computer ized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th e out-of-market prices for months20 None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record20 The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Ca lif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meet ing isnt open to the public20 The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and  operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro ve the market20 The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to  by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra ctices Wolfman said in the letter20 -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjone scom mailtojasonleopolddowjonescom

PGE Corps plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas  Electric unit Californias biggest utility is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the states utilities in red ink now is no time to abandon state oversight Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC called the plan a regulatory jailbreak and a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation by transferring assets to unregulated PGE affiliates The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies transferring the hydro network Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PGE The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout said Bob Glynn chairman president and chief executive of PGE It would provide creditors with about 91 billion in cash and 41 billion in notes EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas  Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties which make up the worlds largest privately held hydropower system Elected officials from 28 counties in PGEs sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept 20 The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro systems rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters PGE spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC and avoid state laws on the asset transfers Lockyer said that in the past PGE had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny Despite PGEs claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agencys approval is required under state law FIRE SALE PRICES PGEs goal is clear They want to transfer most of the utilitys valuable assets to an affiliate company at fire sale prices so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation It is a deregulation plan not a reorganization plan Cohen said PGEs plan conflicts with Californias interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system Deregulation has failed the public and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation said Doug Heller of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights PGEs Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PGE would continue to own and manage power production and transmission Tremayne said however the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company PGEs plan would give the utility 45 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about 13 billion in debts including 9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs The CPUCs Cohen and consumer groups said PGE should receive far more than 45 billion from the assets They point to the value of the hydro network Last fall the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for 28 billion because the system was undervalued in todays market and could fetch a much higher price through an auction The PGE utility and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors

FERC generator hearings -----Original Message-----From McEvoy Bridget mailtoBridgetMcEvoyElPasocom BN  1806 Talks Between California Generators End No Accord Correct Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to result disagreements adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph Washington July 9 Bloomberg -- A judge who oversaw two weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two sides no closer to an accord In 15 days you cant work miracles said Curtis Wagner FERCs chief administrative law judge The numbers were too far apart California says it is due a refund of 89 billion because the companies charged excessive prices Other western states are also requesting money A group of power sellers offered 510 million to California during the negotiations scoffing at the states method of calculating the refund Wagner said Other parties to the talks offered about 206 million bringing the total offer from generators to 716 million On Saturday the state brought in analysts who explained how the state calculated its estimate He wasnt convinced by Californias arguments that it should receive 89 billion said Wagner who wouldnt provide his own estimate of how much should be paid Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price caps on June 18 The caps are based on the costs of the highest priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct 1 Wagner said He wouldnt provide an estimate of the size of such a refund saying it would require research into fuel prices from that time period Michael Kahn Californias chief negotiator said the judges recommendation was a victory for his state Wagners formula would give his state a refund of several billion dollars and California will sue to get the rest he said The judge said were entitled to our money without releasing any of our claims Kahn told reporters Generators were mixed on what Wagners recommendations meant though they agreed the state asked for too much Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with to justify the 89 billion refund we would be owed money because we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in question said Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron Corp one of the power sellers taking part in the negotiations Thats shows how ridiculous this is Houston-based Enron didnt participate in the offer to refund 510 million Palmer said without being more specific Nothing Ive seen suggests that California cares about a settlement Palmer said What they care about is shifting blame What they care about is a witch hunt Duke Energy Corp is very pleased by the judges recommendations said Brent Bailey vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company The judges plan fixes problems with Californias methodology for calculating the refunds he said Californias two biggest utilities have piled up almost 14 billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when the states plan to deregulate its electricity system failed The state began buying power on the utilities behalf in January and has spent close to 8 billion --Amy Strahan Butler and Jeff Bliss in Washington 202 624-1975 or jblissbloombergnet and

about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before That sale reported by the California Independent System Operator and confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on Californias power crisis On Monday the Department of Water Resources the agency that has been purchasing Californias bulk power needs in lieu of the states cash-strapped utilities released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the LADWP charged the state an average of 242 a megawatt-hour for power from Jan 18 through May 31 this year That price is about 35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators Gov Gray Davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration however is that the LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman who in April became Davis top energy adviser Steve Maviglio press secretary to Davis said Texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the states two largest utilities Anywhere they wear cowboy hats they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind he said The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators Freemans trademark is a white Stetson The former LADWP chief who last September quipped that a blind pig could make money under Californias faulty deregulation setup didnt return calls for comment Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state Power To Sell According to the DWR report the LADWP brought in 331 million selling power to the state between Jan 18 and May 31 this year The LADWP which didnt take part in the states deregulation debacle and which isnt under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators also cashed in throughout 2000 The utility has 7000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5500 MW to serve its retail customers freeing it to sell as much as 1000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators were charging The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down 200 million in debt and will reduce its customers rates in 2002 It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it Freeman said in an interview last year Last July ratings agency Fitch concluded that Californias electricity shortage provided LADWP an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal systems coffers According to a report by the ISO manager of the states electricity grid the LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001 by as much as 20 million Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility On Tuesday an LADWP spokesman defended the utilitys power prices saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly 9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001 On Monday settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down Other municipal utilities including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to California at the last minute -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjonescom END Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01 1557EDT AP-DJ--07-10-01 1557EDT TICKER EIX PCG SRE SUBJECT EUTL CA COBO MU PETR Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones and Company Inc Received by NewsEDGELAN 71001 1257 PM

SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS 07102001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-1 Copyright 2001  The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- Californias energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records show During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas  Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power the report shows Their average prices ranged from 498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to 292 an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period Those companies average prices ranged from 146 to 240 per megawatt-hour according to an analysis of the documents The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period You have to look at the whole picture Maviglio said The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were 100 to 400 above last year    Just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatt-hour doesnt change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or Charlotte The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1700 pages of documents on Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the years first quarter The records detail how the state spent nearly 8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from 316 in January to 243 in May Spot prices fell from an average of 321 per hour to 271 the reports show In the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies For example Houston-based Enron one of the nations biggest power traders charged an average of 181 per megawatt-hour And Atlanta-based Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of 706 million charged an average of 225 per megawatt-hour By contrast a Calgary Canada firm TransAlta Energy averaged 335 a megawatt-hour and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of 330 per megawatt-hour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas  Electric said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reached Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agencys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market Still the state had to purchase 321 million in power in April and May about 10 more than Davis analysts had projected Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under 100 a megawatt-hour A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy Copyright  2000

a critical step before they could be marketed to investors Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the states energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers But the PUC said the administrations proposal might prove inadequate over time leading to future rate hikes The PUC also said the administrations plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue The PUC which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates did not want to cede that authority It rejected the Davis plan Oct 2 on a 4-1 vote led by its president Davis appointee Loretta Lynch Davis earlier said the commissions approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market The plan now under review however would bypass that The DWR would not directly set rates but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates Ive been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves then great Lynch said But to dedicate rates it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law a statutory set-aside It takes one of those two things The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislatures version of the payback plan By law the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx by Senate Leader John Burton D-San Francisco Davis opposes Burtons bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid followed by the energy suppliers The power companies contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute If Davis signs the order soon the bonds could go to market early next year Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected 4 billion to 6 billion shortfall in other income This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s Any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited If you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to Enron Corp at enronmessagingadministrationenroncom and delete all copies of the message This e-mail and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between Enron Corp or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise Thank you

Consider this In Memoriam for those who lost their lives in the tragic events of September 11 2001 Today Dress Wounds  Tomorrow Redress Grievances Revised by Michael Rectenwald httpwwwlegitgovorgsept11woundshtml At this time let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain in need in emergencies and in unfathomable grief  Let us focus in the immediate on the spirit the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to address with loving hearts minds and hands our physical moral and spiritual wounds which wounds are so deep and many tonight We are all suffering tonight but others suffer more than we do Let us help them Let us suspend our grievances for a brief time to focus on the well-being of our fellow human beings Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day and both have arguably contributed the day is ours and we must gather its bleeding members and wrap ourselves around them as bandages around lacerations Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today who had arms legs and parts of people falling on our heads Our nation is poorer our lives are lessened and our hearts are heavy tonight We who love democracy and value the lives of all people equally find ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally behind a leader who we know is not our leader a leader who has we believe already inflicted wounds on our nation a leader who has our nations fate in his hands and who has already endangered us Our anger towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --is justified We have warned and warned Bush is dangerous domestically and abroad Now under Bush we have experienced another unprecedented assault on our nation following the first one delivered on Jan 20 -- the worst act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation We do not think that this attack under Bushs command represents a meaningless coincidence Rather the events are linked part of that inescapable web of mutuality that Martin Luther King referred to There was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative consequences in and for the world The Bush political legacy from GH to GW on down has contributed greatly to the ire directed at our citizens That tensions in the Middle East have been exacerbated by the laissez faire policies of the unilateralist Bush that Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bushs non-stewardship the situation has approached anarchy not many in the movement and indeed the world doubt We must in very short order resume our assault on Bushs international policies of unilateralism bellicose posturing and treaty-breaking and soon before more casualties occur as a result But at the present moment and I mean in the very immediate moment let us address a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life liberty and the peaceable pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs Lets tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to those nearest us Therefore for the brief duration of our imperilment lets show some restraint with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose in our outrage at the ships captain and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism for example will not help either the nation or our movement it will hurt those in pain and alienate those who might otherwise concur with us However when delivered from this hopefully short excursus into Hell after reaching relatively safe harbor we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate captain   Our commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather it will take on a deeper significance  We will have purified ourselves to a degree and will then be more fit for direct action We will make sure our hearts are in the right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best interests of our nation at heart Let us then attend to our own and care for the nation displaying our own deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too much to contribute to bellicose international posturing and that also cares too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human beings The evils of today are more than enough for today Sincerely Michael Rectenwald Founder and Chair Citizens for Legitimate

X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst In another surprise move the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote  This item was not on the Commissions agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edisons SVP of Regulatory Affairs and heres a summary The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off 33 B in Edisons past due accounts the so-called undercollection If Edison collects the 33B prior to 2003 then rates can change If Edison has not collected the 33 B by the end of 2003 the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005 Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the 33 B undercollection Edison can keep 10 of any refunds received after the 33B is paid off Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the 33B Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs ie if DWRs costs go up the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edisons rates The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edisons capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1 the filed rate doctrine and 2 the so-called TURN accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place Edison agrees to cooperate with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them Best Jeff -----Original Message-----From 	Dasovich Jeff Sent	Tuesday October 02

Richard Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Higgason Kelly Whalley Greg Mellencamp Lisa Subject	California Update--100201  PUC Turns Down Davis Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the California PUC today voted down Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC The vote was 4-1 with the two Republicans voting with Davis hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood Davis proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis proposed rate agreement What is Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs no questions asked What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis proposal With the vote it remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the DWR power contracts The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably It remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the 125 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months Under the structure devised by Davis the revenues flowing from the CPUCDWR rate agreement would be used to both 1 pay for the DWR power contracts and 2 service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay Californias General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January In short there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds Safe to say that todays PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis and left his approach to solving California electricity crisis in shambles What Next A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill 18XX that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support The bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the 125 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget The bill is silent however on how California would pay for the DWR contracts and the bills opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill  The left-right coalition from Nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get Davis to sign it Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel Given todays vote however Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another special session next Tuesday If you have any questions just let us know Best Jeff

CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought  I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention 1  According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions 2  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy Real-Time auction first  CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section 862 d  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy  If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as 000  Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR 3  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as 000  Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it 4  While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis  Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts  Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO 5  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of 000 expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to 000  These SCs are in for a big surprise  According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as 400MWh for imbalance energy  Where is the price mitigation here 6  Who benefits under this scam  Davis and CDWR  Who loses under this scam  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy 7  Sources  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also 8  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no real-time price transparency We may see an hourly ex-post price of say 15 but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets 9  Here is the

Legal Cc     DL-Portland Volume Mgmt Subject        487 Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487 487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds 15000mwh 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO  His response was this  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS  In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS -Kit

mailtoMDayGMSSRcom Sent Monday September 17 2001 1245 PM To Jeff Dasovich Enron SF Cc Sue Mara at Enron SF Subject Status of CPUC Proposed Decisions on Direct Access Suspension Jeff At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access program  There are two pending draft decisions at this time the first is the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett Item H-7 on the last agenda which was modified by a changed version submitted by Pres Lynch at 245 pm on 9-5-01 the day before the last meeting  This version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order which would have been Sept 6 and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective Sept 6 2001 specifically naming that date  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of Sept 6 if it had been voted out that day  The other item Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda is the Bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds and does not suspend direct access at this time Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on Sept 20  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date  All that is required to make this change is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the Commission meeting  Thus it is important for all direct access supporters to continue to urge the Commission especially Commissioner Brown to support a suspension date later than Sept 6 because it is so easy for the date to be altered under Commission procedures Please let me know if you require any additional information on this subject Mike Day

Rosman Stewart Scholtes Diana Semperger Cara Stokley Chris Swain Steve Swerzbin Mike Symes Kate Walton Steve Williams III Bill Subject	FW FERC Meeting Summary Importance	High Todays FERC meeting was a big deal   Some of the key actions are DSTAR and RTO West are to be married  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12101 or possibly 1215 not sure of date  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided below Alan Comnes The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues  The following is a summary of the meeting  The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks  1 organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like and 2 substantive -- once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No 2000 into RTO structures  To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October 15-19 in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as  congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No 888 transmission tariff  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation  Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO  If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis  Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs  Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there  In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops End of October -- further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December 15 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers  As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers  As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers  As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it  We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues  Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days  In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over  Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

Dasovich Jeff 	Cc 	Subject Re Dissent from Commissioners Bilas and Duque Opposing Suspension of DA 	I have a new description of PGEs reorg plan-- it is the ultimate 	expression of their longstanding affliction with Enron-envy Now that 	theyre cutting loose the UDCLDC they can fall flat on their faces with 	no safety net except the hydro of course   MIKE 	At 0443 PM 9242001 -0500 you wrote 	   Commissioners Henry M Duque and Richard A Bilas dissenting 	  	  One could say that this order is consistent with the Administrations 	  present third world country mentality We are punishing the very 	  consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric 	  restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the 	  dysfunctions in the wholesale market 	  	  We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources DWR bond 	  ratings depend on killing direct access  This notion is a scare 	  tactic and a smoke screen Direct access comprises such a small 	  percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a 	  threat to the sale of the bonds Direct Access should be seen as a 	  benefit to DWR  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net 	  short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing 	  responsibilities sooner 	  	  Something else is going on here We think that the DWR does not want 	  direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it 	  will make DWRs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear The Commission 	  should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR 	  Finance and the Treasurer  Instead the Commission is making an ill 	  informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions 	  later 	  	        DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if 	  DWR is making prudent energy purchases Only if DWRs contracts are 	  too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in 	  lower direct access prices Indeed retaining direct access as a way 	  to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place 	  pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases This is a very 	  important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any 	  prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in 	  order to repay the bonds If there is no yardstick how can anyone 	  measure DWR performance The answer is one cant unless SB 18xx is 	  signed into law 	  	        We think that additional review of these issues before 	  suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in 	  the long run 	  	  For these reasons we must respectfully dissent 	  	  	  	  	  s HENRY M DUQUE                              s RICHARD A BILAS 	          Henry M Duque 	  Richard A

directed by the man who heads the states energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter the president of the Independent System Operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge Winter defied his own board and Gov Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps records and interviews show I dont know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said Dunn The subpoenas will force those involved including Winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over e-mails personal calendars and memos Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of Winter The governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis Maviglio said Winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunns committee will find no criminal conduct The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on At the time generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps It was an emergency Fishman said We had to take action What became known as the palace coup began on Oct 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power The restrictions would drive prices as low as 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier They electricity generators grinned and beared the 750 price cap but this new plan by ISO was too much said Dunn whose committee has been investigating since March All hell broke loose Records show that on Oct 31 power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission demanding that the new plan be killed The letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators If not removed immediately the ISO price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws In the Oct 31 letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps werent removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market The generators got their way The next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan What was left in place was a 250 price cap established five months earlier Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldnt make a profit even under these constraints They began to withhold power from California and on Dec 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis Winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO submitted a 50-page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the 250 price cap Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government Neither the ISO board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of Winters actions until the cap had been removed In fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request Charles Robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made He didnt mention anything about it In retrospect we should have told them Robinson said With the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governors key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment Maviglio said It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant This action accelerated the utilities move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business Prices for electricity jumped from an average of 249 a megawatt to 700 a megawatt within three days ISO records show Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded 30 billion Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians Prices he said did not spike as a result Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern Robinson said In our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund Jan Smutney-Jones who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted Terry did this by himself said Smutney-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions Some board members pushed to have Winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governors spokesman Maviglio said James J Hoecker the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman defended making the December decision and also defended Winter They filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let California go dark Hoecker said They ISO management did what any independent system operator would do What Dunns committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winters Dec 8 actions should provide vital clues We dont know why he did what he did but we are eager to find out Dunn said Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians but I find that argument has no basis in fact

X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst On another food for thought note  Eldon and Nancy  Heres the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude credentialed lib and Quaker--on just wars  Sort of thought-provoking Best Jeff October 11 2001 Commentary Even Pacifists Must Support This War By Scott Simon the host of National Public Radios Weekend Edition With Scott Simon Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals They prepare for the last war not the next one Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to todays war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade They put on old familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now Pacifism has never been exactly popular But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches fasts and boycotts that were nervy ennobling and effective Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction I worked as a war reporter but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage those details struck me as critical to explaining war I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America the Caribbean Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions In fact most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten wasteful and useless El Salvadors civil war killed 70000 people over nine years It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months But in the 1990s I covered the Balkans In Sarajevo Srebrenica and Kosovo I confronted the logical flaw or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw of nonviolent resistance All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers neither does militarism About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war I dont consider this reprisal or revenge but self-defense protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them Some peace activists their judgment still hobbled by shock seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters terrible unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur This is wrong We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations with none being more gloriously speckled than the US People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation Resolved that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germanys new chancellor Hitler The West will not fight for its own survival Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender In short the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones and a dictatorship founded on racism tyranny and fear And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace Should Americans impose a unitary religious state throw women out of school and work and rob other religious groups of their rights so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the US were still trying to placate Hitler Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the US in time of war But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place It calls on Americas military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent Only American and British power can stop more killing in the worlds skyscrapers pizza parlors embassies bus stations ships and airplanes Pacifists like most Americans would like to change their country in a thousand ways And the blasts of Sept 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact peaceful change -- seems most possible It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them -----Original

final   exam  Thanks     HS       Guidelines for MBA Case-Study Alternative          Instead of taking the final exam in this   course you have the   option of writing three short papers analyzing  case   studies of   transactions Your grade will be determined by the   best two of the   three papers you hand in At least two of the   studies must be   individually authored One may be submitted as a   group project if you   have classmates you wish to collaborate with  There   is no requirement   however that you participate in a group  projectyou   may do all three   on your own          Coverage At least two of your papers should   address case   studies from the Masten book You may cover case   studies we have   already discussed in class or you may choose cases   we skipped or have   not yet covered If you wish one of your three   papers may address a   case study from another source or from your own  work   experience It is   important however that the case involve   transactional issues   Examples of appropriate cases are those involving   procurement   negotiations make-or-buy decisions contractual   bargaining or   renegotiation and structural transactions like   mergers acquisitions   or spin-offs          Your paper should be structured around  several   questions 1   what is the phenomenon to be explained and why is  it   interesting 2   What explanations does the author of the study  offer   for the observed   facts Or if an outside case why did the  parties   involved do what   they did 3 Do you find the authors theory   convincing Why andor   why not 4 What alternative explanations would  you   want to   investigate for the empirical evidence Are there   any explanations you   think are likely to be as or more important And   5 what applied   value does the study have in the business   settingie what are the   useful take-home lessons for managers You need  not   restrict yourself   to these questions or strictly follow the above   structure It is just a   suggested guideline for the kind of coverage I   expect          Deadlines The first paper will be due  October   31 the second   is due November 28 and the third is due December   12 You may submit   the papers in Word or Wordperfect format by e-mail   or in person In   order to give you guidance on grading and   expectations I will return   the October 31 papers in class the following week          Length There is no set length although I   expect it will take   5-7 double-spaced pages to cover the suggested   analysis Some of you   may wish to write more and in some cases you  might   do a good job in   fewer pages But 5-7 pages is generally what I  have   in mind Please use   12-point font and standard 1-inch margins            Do You Yahoo  Make a great

For Montana Power a Broadband Dream May Turn Out to Be More of a Nightmare By BILL RICHARDS Special to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL BUTTE Mont -- This is a gamblers town More than a century ago Marcus Daly turned a bet on a copper vein under Butte into the giant Anaconda Co The gambling game Keno was invented here for bored miners In 1974 stuntman Evel Knievel a Butte native made headlines betting -- unsuccessfully -- that he could jump the Snake River Canyon on his rocket-powered motorcycle Now Bob Gannon another Butte native and chairman and chief executive of Montana Power Co is betting he can pull off his own breathtaking stunt He plans to turn his staid 89-year-old utility into a high-tech high-flier gannon httpinteractivewsjcompublicresourcesimagesGannonBob-FM23808212001221914gif In one dizzying two-year stretch the Butte-based utility has sold just about all its assets -- power plants transmission lines dams gas coal and oil fields -- pouring much of the 16 billion take into a coast-to-coast fiber-optic network By the end of this year Mr Gannon boasts Montana Power will have 26000 miles of fiber in the ground a new corporate name Touch America and it will be among the nations largest half-dozen broadband companies So far Mr Gannons gamble seems to be following the same trajectory as Mr Knievels The joke around here is that at least Mr Knievel wore a parachute Indeed while plenty of companies have been hammered by the telecommunications bust few have taken a more severe beating than Montana Power Under Mr Gannons leadership the company sold out of the energy business just as electric rates were taking off and bought into broadband as it was poised to tank Now only 5 to 10 of Touch Americas fiber is being used Mr Gannons makeover of the venerable utility has touched off warfare here pitting Montana Power against regulators investors consumer advocates and its own former corporate customers The companys stock which hit a high of 65 a share five days after Mr Gannon announced his decision to dump the utility business in March of last year has spiralled downward since At 4 pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday it was at 790 The decision by Montana Powers board to authorize a 66 million share buyback during the plunge didnt boost Mr Gannons image either The spree cost the company 2048 million the purchased shares are now valued at about 52 million But perhaps most galling to Montanans are the huge gains made by PPL Corp the Pennsylvania utility that bought Montana Powers electric generating plants PPL has sold nearly a third of the plants power out-of-state at a huge markup producing record profits Meanwhile state utility regulators angry at Mr Gannons refusal to share proceeds of the asset sale with customers have locked his company into a painful contract Montana Power is required to continue supplying power to its 288000 customers until 2007 even though it owns no more power plants That has forced the company to purchase electricity from PPL Montana Power which is barred from raising customer rates has been losing money on the transactions Long Expensive Fight The five-member utility commission could decide to let Montana Power boost its rates next year But the high price of providing power has already drained the companys coffers To cut back on its expenses Montana Power agreed in June to pay 625 million to cancel the last year-and-a-half of a long-term supply contract with one of its biggest commercial customers Butte-based Advanced Silicon Materials Last week in an unusual lawsuit filed in state district court in Helena eight Montana Power shareholders charged the utility its board and its senior executives and consultants with a breach of fiduciary duty for failing to get shareholders approval for the companys transformation The suit seeks a rollback of Mr Gannons makeover charging the effort has cost shareholders 3 billion It also seeks to return to shareholders what it calls PPLs illegal gains from power sales Were trying to salvage the pension funds of thousands of Montanans who are wrapped up in this company says Frank Morrison Jr a former state Supreme Court justice and one of the attorneys filing the suit Six of the states largest law firms collaborated on the suit Mr Morrison says because we anticipate a long expensive fight Montana Power would not discuss its reasons for not seeking shareholder approval for the makeover but says it has done nothing wrong and will defend itself vigorously All this has tattered Mr Gannons reputation as a hometown genius Just last year Wall Street analysts and media praised his bold makeover plan He was cheered during the companys annual meeting a folksy conclave held at Buttes Mother Lode Theater that is part business session part homecoming party More than a third of the companys registered shareholders live in Montana But this year angry shareholders and customers have picketed the companys headquarters and Web sites are springing up across the state to rally voters to punish Montana Power Earlier this month Michelle Lee a Democratic legislator from Livingston launched Dumpthedealcom wwwdumpthedealcom httpwwwdumpthedealcom1 a Web site urging a referendum to repeal deregulation of the electric industry in Montana She says the site drew more than 1000 visitors in its first two weeks A lot of people here just cant believe whats happened to Montana Power says Ralph McCaughy who retired from the companys data-processing department three years ago Mr McCaughy who is 62 years old and has throat cancer says he and his wife Jean had planned to use some of their Montana Power shares and dividends to buy a new car to replace their wheezy 1993 Honda and take a trip to Hawaii Montana Power stopped paying dividends last year as part of the makeover Mr McCaughy says his spending plans are on hold I dont know whether Gannon and the bunch running the company couldnt stop themselves or what he says Enduring Hecklers These days strangers sometimes blow raspberries and heckle Mr Gannon during his daily two-block trek from his office to Gamers a local luncheonette that features a Butte specialty -- pork-chop sandwiches The fact that Montana Power -- always one of the states most powerful political forces -- led the lobbying drive for deregulation in the state hasnt helped his popularity Deregulated electricity prices soared so high here last summer that several large Montana companies that had elected to buy power on the open market closed or cut back operations Steven Walsh president of Montana Resources which operates part of Anacondas open-pit mine in Butte says he shut the mine and laid off 322 people last summer after his electricity bill jumped to 627 a megawatt hour from 26 an hour in a week Prices have begun to come down but the mine is still shut I dont hold any animosity toward Bob Gannon Mr Walsh says But around here I guess the general feeling is they made a big mistake Despite the companys battered stock price some Wall Street analysts say they still have hope for the transformation and they note that Touch America -- which expects to have 16 billion in assets including 350 million in cash -- has a stronger balance sheet than most of its telecom competition Defending His Position Mr Gannon denies rumors that he has been punched out in several Butte bars but Montana Powers Internet message boards are sizzling with rants by angry investors threatening to show up at this years Sept 14 annual meeting with tar feathers or worse Bobs a decent human being and I still like the guy says Paul Cote the owner of Gamers But I have heard people bad-mouthing him Theres a lot of people upset with him right now Mr Gannon who can see the house where he grew up -- beyond the Hock-It-To-Me pawnshop -- from his office window defends his makeover decision Energy deregulation during the late 1990s doomed smaller regional utilities such as Montana Power he says while fiber optics was becoming a glamour industry The company had begun laying fiber-optic lines in the 1980s As the business began to take off in the 1990s Mr Gannon and others believed they had a solid head start Theres a lot of second-guessing taking place now he says But we were the ones sitting in the chair and we made a decision that was absolutely correct and justified Others blame Montana Powers problems on overreaching by Mr Gannon and the utilitys management as well as on strong salesmanship by Goldman Sachs Montana Powers investment bankers Critics of the deal have suggested that Montana Powers 11-member board -- stocked with seven Montanans -- might not have fully appreciated the risks and challenges of the fiber-optic business They were intoxicated by their stock price and Wall Street was telling them Hey youre on a roll  says Robert Anderson a Public Service Commission member These were utility guys What did they know about the telecommunications business Mr Gannon and other senior officials who were part of the Policy Leadership Group a Montana Power internal decision-making team say that until shortly before last years makeover announcement they hadnt decided to turn Montana Power into a telecom At first Mr Gannon says the group had been comfortable with a more limited step an initial public offering of the Touch America unit The group also considered spinning off Touch America to Montana Powers shareholders or continuing to build it up within the company he says Goldman Sachs which has worked with the utility for 17 years urged the companys management to drop its power business entirely company officials say Goldman specialists from New York Los Angeles and Chicago made more than 100 visits to Butte camping at the Copper King Motel and advising the utility executives on their options As the discussions went on company officials say divestiture of the power business seemed the most logical choice Mr Gannon and others say Goldmans bankers warned that the IPO market was losing its luster and urged them to sell their power-making assets quickly to get the best price Matt Darnell a Goldman managing director who advised Montana Power on its move toward telecommunications declines to give specifics of Goldmans recommendations to either the policy group or Montana Powers board There were numerous options explored he says but we certainly supported the thoughtful and deliberative approach the board took Of the subsequent downward turn of events Mr Darnell says The telecommunications industry has taken a turn no one expected For its advice Goldman will get 25 of the gross payout from the asset sale or about 142 million a Montana Power spokesman says Goldman officials say they are no longer advising Montana Power on its business plan Mr Gannon scoffs at the notion that his company made the wrong move In a strongly worded letter last week he urged shareholders to approve the final pieces of his makeover plan at the Sept 14 annual meeting He warned that if the shareholders rejected the measures Montana Powers board would seek to accomplish the divestiture of the utility business through unspecified other methods Demand for fiber-optic networks will regain strength before long Mr Gannon says When it does Touch America could have an advantage over its debt-laden competition Mr Gannon says his company will emerge as one of the telecom industrys strongest national players with no debt and a state-of-the-art technology There are a lot of suggestions in watering holes around this state that Goldman was flying around the West looking for a bunch of guys to dupe and that we were a bunch of rubes from Montana who got taken in he says Thats the stupidest thing I have ever heard -----Original

Swain Steve Brodbeck Kelly Cc     Keeler Jeff Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Subject        CEC Report on Natural Gas Supplies Adopted The CEC just approved a report drafted by staff that states there will be adequate natural gas supply this winter for electricity generation needs  It does qualify this statement by discussing where potential bottlenecks in delivery might occur and recommends actions to address the bottlenecks  See below for a link to the report Mary Schoen Environmental Strategies Enron Corp 4157827803 phone 4157827854 fax For immediate release October 3 2001 Contact Claudia Chandler  916-654-4989 Energy Commission Report Projects Improved Natural Gas Supplies For the State Sacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000s average price the specter remains of last December when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates Now as winter approaches industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report  adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission gives a qualified yes to the question of adequate supplies this winter It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand For this reason the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year The newly adopted report points out that Californias natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winters peak heating demand An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity however has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future said Energy Commissioner Michal spelling correct Moore Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document To help resolve possible supply problems the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines  those within our States borders  can receive As a result there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved Pacific Gas and Electric Company PGE and Southern California Gas Company SoCal Gas are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints According to the report planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook It also suggests that the Energy Commission along with the Public Utilities Commission should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas The just

Station   CNBC Location  Network Program   The Squawk Box Mark Haines co-anchor Joe Kernen whats going on Joe Kernen co-anchor Weve got to shift gears into this Enron situation which has just been--youve been talking about it quite a bit David--how could you not talk about it  Seventy-six million shares yesterday down fifty percent in the last two weeks  This is a company with--what--a hundred million in revenues James Cramer guest market commentator Maybe Kernen  Yeah right  Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses Enron Online so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and Cramer  Go ahead say it  Say what youre thinking  No one has said it yet  We know the truth  We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze  They knew every single number in this gas situation  They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it  Thats my bet  My bet that this--they had--look they were the market maker  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you  I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there were going to discover this Kernen  Lets see what happened Haines  Now wait a second David Faber co-anchor Whoa whoa whoa  The Justice Department Jim  Now is that new  Is that something--Cramer  No that would be if I were a prosecutor something Faber  OK so they are not being investigated Cramer  Well no Im actually being a little forward thinking Kernen  The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr--Faber  Which is very different from what Jim is talking about Cramer  No Im saying that this is what if I were an enterprising prosecutor I would say Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up Kernen  Well lets talk about the actual news  Heres yesterdays trading--Haines  Wait a minute Kernen  Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now Thats the new news here  Did you read--did you know that Fastow after four--Faber  Late yesterday Kernen  Yeah after four oclock Fastow is gone  Whats interesting--Faber  Hes the CFO--Kernen  But hes a new CFO Faber  --who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships Cramer  Mark you know Im not on thin ice here Im not on thin ice Haines  I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory Cramer  This is my theory Haines  OK Cramer  It is just a theory  It is my opinion  But I think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred Haines  OK Cramer  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated Kernen  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr Fastow was doing business apparently  So now hes back as CFO and well whether that calms the market down Faber  Well what they need to do-- Joe they need to come clean  I mean that is what all the investors in Enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted  Lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know  And as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about Kernen  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal  Anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading Faber  Well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades Kernen  I guess you would wouldnt you Faber  Right  Not that they arent but why would you--if you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there Kernen  Now why would--Faber  And that would hurt their core business Kernen  Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right Because of something that could unravel--Faber  Because of something related to these liabilities they may have--Kernen  That they dont know about at this point Faber  --that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership  Will it be a liability They dont know  But thats one of the reasons--Kernen  Were talking hundreds of millions or billions Faber  They dont know Kernen  But there were billions of dollars in limited partners Faber  Yes  About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated Kernen  This is a pretty big number Faber  Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves Kernen  I use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks  You got to look at here  But if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for Enron  Now were at sixteen Faber  Everybody else took a hit yesterday  Dynegy got hurt Kernen  Well I got Dynegy next  Dont--  Here we go Faber  Im sorry  Im getting a little excited Kernen  You are Faber  Enthusiastic about your charts Kernen  Theres a weekly chart of Dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you  Now Im worried about the utility average  Ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career  Mark now the utilities have replaced my worries  Im angst-ridden  Did you see this chart  Were breaking below the--Cramer  Thats a positive not a negative Joe Kernen  Whats wrong with Cramer today  What happened Cramer  Im all fired up Faber  He really is  My God hes got the DOJ getting all crazy the FBI the CIA  You going down to En--you going down to Houston yourself Cramer  I may just have to  I may have to clean up that whole city Kernen  Jim why would the--thats the--now getting down to the lows I mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the post-attack lows the utilities are retesting those  Thats not something to worry about Cramer  No because I think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues  I think the economy is showing signs of getting better  The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought  The base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong  Much stronger than before Kernen  All right  In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though  I dont--were talking about four hundred to two-ninety at this point  Thats a long way Cramer  This average has got a lot of problems to it but I still think that--Kernen  Its no longer the--Cramer  --you sell this as safety  We dont want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality

PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote  This item was not on the Commissions agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edisons SVP of Regulatory Affairs and heres a summary The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off 33 B in Edisons past due accounts the so-called undercollection If Edison collects the 33B prior to 2003 then rates can change If Edison has not collected the 33 B by the end of 2003 the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005 Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the 33 B undercollection Edison can keep 10 of any refunds received after the 33B is paid off Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the 33B Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs ie if DWRs costs go up the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edisons rates The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edisons capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1 the filed rate doctrine and 2 the so-called TURN accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place Edison agrees to cooperate with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them Best Jeff -----Original Message-----From 	Dasovich Jeff Sent	Tuesday October 02 2001 245 PM To	Kean Steven J Belden Tim Sharp Vicki Blachman Jeremy Comnes Alan Tribolet Michael

Update--100201  PUC Turns Down Davis Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the California PUC today voted down Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC The vote was 4-1 with the two Republicans voting with Davis hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood Davis proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis proposed rate agreement What is Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs no questions asked What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis proposal With the vote it remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the DWR power contracts The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably It remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the 125 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months Under the structure devised by Davis the revenues flowing from the CPUCDWR rate agreement would be used to both 1 pay for the DWR power contracts and 2 service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay Californias General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January In short there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds Safe to say that todays PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis and left his approach to solving California electricity crisis in shambles What Next A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill 18XX that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support The bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the 125 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget The bill is silent however on how California would pay for the DWR contracts and the bills opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill  The left-right coalition from Nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get Davis to sign it Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel Given todays vote however Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another special session next Tuesday If you have any questions just let us know Best Jeff

httpwwwsacbeecomaboutuslegal20 Dan Walters Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m emory Published Aug 29 200120 Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in  decades in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics 20 The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov Gray D avis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining its larger cousin Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy court That is  odd unto itself since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented20 Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated around the Capitol ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea ched agreement with John Bryson chairman of Edison International the util itys parent corporation The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft er PGE rejected Davis overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court Bo th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta il rates20 Edisons -- or perhaps Brysons -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a spect of the issue given the almost cheerful manner in which PGE placed i tself in receivership Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying ad vertising and other forms of political persuasion trying to nudge the Legi slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to  do20 Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson Or as some s uggest does it stem from Edisons tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin ancial fire wall between the utilitys assets and those of the parent holdi ng company Edison International Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft er bankruptcy loomed but financial analysts are uncertain that its as str ong as PGEs20 The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal ly odd following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians do what they do Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E dison issue and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd s One example Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou t for the utility while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme  because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed  under state control20 Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis or dinarily the most cautious commitment-averse of politicians is making suc h a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court Why would Davis put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition  that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g overnor and polls indicate is not popular with voters20 Harvey Rosenfield the consumer gadfly who has established a war room nea r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme believes that Davis unusual effo rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St reet would blackball him if Edison follows PGE into bankruptcy court20 Another possible explanation is Davis decades-long relationship with Bryso n The two served together in former Gov Jerry Browns administration Bry son was Browns Public Utilities Commission president and both have strong ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b y Reps Henry Waxman and Howard Berman who in effect allowed Davis to la unch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 198220 The most influential member of Edisons board of directors is Warren Christ opher a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state Bryson a nd Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to tak e command of the energy crisis allow utilities to raise rates and staunch  the red ink Davis refused and nearly a year later finds himself trying to keep Edison out of bankruptcy court20 We may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison but we will know v ery soon whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face 20  20 The Bees Dan Walters can be reached at 916 321-1195 or dwalterssacbeec om mailtodwalterssacbeecom -----Original

gets to Appropriations  Subsequently 20 Hedy and I spoke to DJ Smith at Jeff19 s request  DJ agreed that the  bill20 needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA20 contracts but specifically asked that we Enron not speak to Richard abou t20 it  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying 20 amendment  If we request it he thought Richard would be less likely to20 believe its clarifying since he believes our motives to be too20 self-serving  Also we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct20 access  We suggested that 1C shall1D be changed to 1C may1D in order t o give more20 leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension  He didn19 t necessarily op pose20 the policy but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can20 totally rewrite it which he later attempted to do20 A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to20 push Edison into bankruptcy along with the Canadian government if this20 bill passes20 There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor19 s 20 desk20 The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 130 pm to vote o n20 additional amendments and

business a corporate bailout and a bad deal for consumers Davis responded by saying 1 the Assembly did a good job 2 the Senate failed to do its job and 3 Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldnt take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim A press account and Davis statement are attached Best Jeff GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win approval in the California State Senate I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness Unfortunately however the Senate has not gotten the job done It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3000 Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers We worked hard to bring this energy which was crucial in avoiding blackouts back on-line earlier this summer I will call a Third Extraordinary Session which will begin in approximately two weeks so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy Edison has assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its creditors will continue to show restraint California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility JENNIFER KERR Associated Press

early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy and Gov Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session a 200 million program to help the states neediest schools won approval So did bills to give drivers licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds But senators remained cool to Davis idea of bailing out Southern California Edison They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly which also adjourned early Saturday We didnt take it up because we didnt want to embarrass the governor said President Pro Tem John Burton It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation The deals quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April saying the state would pay 276 billion for Edisons transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its 39 billion debt Without the deal Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co the states largest utility The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after amassing about 89 billion in debt due to last years sky-high electricity costs Edison says it has accrued 39 billion in debts The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday Unfortunately however the Senate has not gotten the job done The new school-improvement program would provide grants of 400 per student to schools with the states lowest test scores They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work tools paid for by the employer and toilets lights and water in housing It also would put into state law a 1050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders While legislators toiled Tuesdays terrorist attacks were never far from their minds Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks The Legislature approved sending 1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal Here in California our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance said Davis 2001 Associated Press

X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst Dan Walters Davis vs Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor When Gov Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUCs president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers All of that occurred however before California was plunged into the energy crisis an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics economics power supply and distribution and such uncontrollable factors as the weather When the first strains were felt 1 12 years ago Davis and Lynch reacted as one might expect in tandem and as later experience proved poorly They refused in effect to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis Last January when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts Davis and Lynch were forced to act But within a couple of months the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart at least publicly At Lynchs behest the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own without his knowledge It was widely seen at the time as a ploy one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary without forcing Davis to publicly change position Since then the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison for example working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad A lengthy article in Mondays Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and in effect endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis That may be true but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that its just another ploy aimed at protecting the governors backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation Polls indicate that its the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year thus making his re-election next year less than certain By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again Holding up approval of the administrations bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and if implemented will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade Davis needs to dump them but if he acts directly hell have to admit that he made a mistake If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor

4th Ive read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language too Im proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill  I would appreciate your feedback  The amendments would be as follows Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power Jan 17th and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes should be exempt from paying for the bonds In short customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP and once from DWR  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldnt be fair to require them to pay for it Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed no more and no less For example if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan 17th thru April 30th I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks  Or if we didnt explicitly agree during the talks they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now And rather than leave the issue hanging which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers obligations are  Your thoughts are appreciated In addition we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in  Providing 20KW and above customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1 reduce the net short position that the state and ultimately consumers have to finance thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility  2 reduce electricity purchasing costs and 3 reduce the burden on the state budget With this in mind Im also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st Finally it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill  If a dedicated rate component is created that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access  And if thats the case would it make sense to delete that language from the bill Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the corenoncore proposal Best Jeff This e-mail is intended solely for use of the individual to whom it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged

Dasovich Jeff Non-PrivilegedDasovich JeffSent Items X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic perfect storm and an election looming Gov Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the states expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away  who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any new contracts asked Peter Cartwright president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp a major supplier of California power And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state which in turn supplies California customers through various utilities Good luck former Republican Gov Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governors plan Davis however has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years perhaps decades This could save billions of dollars said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis power contract renegotiation plan Barry Goode Davis legal affairs secretary said the administration is not targeting every contract because the pacts have been extremely valuable in keeping the market stable The governors aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies whose contracts dont require them to reopen negotiations with the state The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than 40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the states power demands The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years Though the contracts provide power at an average 69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade the current market has dropped to less than half that rate And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses The long-term contracts harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year The liability is compounded due to the pacts potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing perfect storm of fiscal calamities The state Public Utilities Commission principally citing a desire for less costly power has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the states most powerful Democrats Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC Burton has called for Californians to be freed from egregious unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts The deadlock is holding up a 125 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund Californias future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency short-term electricity purchases It would be the largest municipal debt sale in US history Without the bond issue a projected general fund deficit of up to 14 billion next year could grow to a staggering 20 billion-plus forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services according to state finance officials The projected deficit of up to 14 billion in Californias annual budget of about 100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy further chilled by the Sept 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast Against the backdrop of fiscal woes analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes tax increases or both But some analysts are pessimistic like Wilson The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes The Western Power Trading Forum a group representing suppliers and brokers has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers Were not going to say no Wed certainly sit down at the table with them and say Lets see maybe we can do this maybe we can do that said Calpines Cartwright If state officials simply broke some of their contracts not only would penalties be very very severe but also they would have completely blown their credibility and no one would negotiate with them Cartwright said His comments coincided with reports that Calpines third-quarter profits more than doubled despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California one of its main markets Analysts said Calpines performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state Heller one of the states most vocal consumer advocates said Davis is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate or even throw out many of the contracts Last spring Heller said power companies had a gun to the governors head and with staff that already had conflicts of interest the administration signed some terrible deals

which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators all of which were to attend th e meeting20 Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu res of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine mont hs are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st ructure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to dev elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and pr ocedures20 ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC20 The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines wh ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from 20 If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an au dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated  the market Wolfmans office said20 As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud it of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement  division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could  lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated20 The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po wer first20 The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe r at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the  second letter says20 The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and decl ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays me eting20 Generators Confused20 Generators including Mirant Corp MIR httpquickenexcitecominvestme ntsquotessymbol3DMIR news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnews symbol3DMIR msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbo l3DMIR Reliant Energy Inc REI httpquickenexcitecominvestments quotessymbol3DREI news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssy mbol3DREI msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3D REI Williams Cos WMB httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessy mbol3DWMB news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DWMB  msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DWMB Duk e Energy DUK httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3DDUK news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DDUK msgs htt pquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DDUK and Dynegy Inc  DYN httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3DDYN news ht tpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DDYN msgs httpquick enexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DDYN have bought apparently i nexpensive power in the ISOs spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher Thats because according to the allegations the I SO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as out-of-market purchases that arent averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p articipants see20 DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISOs request DW R operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs long-term contracts20 The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive however According to t he ISOs August market report the average out-of-market price for peak hou rs was 5590 a megawatt-hour compared with 2649MWh on the ISO computer ized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th e out-of-market prices for months20 None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record20 The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Ca lif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meet ing isnt open to the public20 The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and  operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro ve the market20 The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to  by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra ctices Wolfman said in the letter20 -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjone scom mailtojasonleopolddowjonescom20  File 092101PCGpdf

California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07062001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate 43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year Gov Gray Davis D said part of the 89 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis Weve made suggestions weve offered various ways in which people could get us 89 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money However you want to do it its just got to net out close to 89 billion The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr according to sources close to the negotiations Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise What Im trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters In the event were unable to do that Friday at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday Wagner FERCs chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California s largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at swords point with generators that help keep the states lights on Last Friday Wagner rebuked Daviss chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the states power grid manager -- indicating that the states demand for nearly 9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said Wagners settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said The suppliers have offered to refund 600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said Wagners leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERCs commissioners FERC has tentatively called for 124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California s electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe Daviss tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals California s energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the states electricity bills In response Daviss aide S David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers The 43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about 70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years Thats well under the average of 250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the states controversial demand for the 89 billion refund Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagners negotiations Industry supporters say Daviss refund figure is impossible to justify Theres no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates The states advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the 9 billion figure Its not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagners conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said

PM To Dasovich Jeff Smith Mike Mara Susan Steffes James D MDay Williams Robert C Cc Sharp Vicki Higgason Kelly Maynard Michelle Subject RE Extensions of CA Deals I also agree  Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation issues are resolved there is a signficant probability that the utilities will insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement and will go screaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any portion of the agreement was executed after Sept 20  As indicated in previous calls that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept 20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms but it cannot be extended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct access without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension IF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept 20  At this time we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues although as Sue Mara has reported there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which will likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the commission on these issues  Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural schedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues Bottom line  The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by means of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after Sept 20  Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the existing agreements can be signed but will remain at risk untilthe renewal or extension issue is addressed by the Commission  Post Sept 20 amendments to the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the pre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered Let me know if you have any other questions Mike Day -----Original Message-----From Dasovich Jeff mailtoJeffDasovichENRONcom Sent Thursday September 27 2001 1006 AM To Smith Mike Mara Susan Steffes James D mdaygmssrcom Williams Robert

Subject	Extensions of CA Deals  CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION  Id like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a  consensus pretty quickly  We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA  deals that we executed on the Master in June  Understanding that  new deals struck after 920 are and extensions of existing deals  may be at risk it seems to me we have three basic options in order  to effect this extension and I want to make sure we evaluate and  choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is  invalidated  Note that DASRs have been submitted for the subject  accounts under the original Transactions  The 3 choices I see are  1  Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add  the extension and new price for the extension  In this case the  extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after  920 but effective in June  2  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and  price  This would be a separate document  3  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term which would  be effective when signed but the services and price under which would  not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction  The  existing Transaction would stay in tact as written  It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall  The  amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is  dated back to June  However if a regulator were to peel it back the  conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and  therefore the whole transaction was invalid including the original  structure  I think that choice 2 though creating a separate document  for the extension could fall into the same trap  In that sense  choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not  at risk  If the extension is invalidated that determination would  likely not claw back to the original deal  The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are  moving fast  Please let me know your thoughts asap  If we need to  have a quick call I can set something up  Thanks  MDS This e-mail is the property of

Evelyn Kahl Subject RE Angelides Oct 19th Letter to L Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date Great question  If you think it would be useful I can back channel to Loretta and find out  Im of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides so that his wild assertions dont go unanswered in the court of public opinion  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides instead On the other hand I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools processes etc necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand and ensure that theres not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other  In the publics view this has been painted as an eitheror issue Either we end direct access or granny faces death and destruction  And thats just not the case In fact I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isnt in the cards period But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views Let me know if youd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her Could find that out in pretty short order Best Jeff -----Original

Power Authoritys own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short despite DWR contracts and DA stampede which should leave one to believe that contrary to Angelides letter the more the

AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority Power Authority was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources DWR rate agreement stalemate has been resolved Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commissions rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts to contract for peaker generation andor to implement demand side programs The Power Authority relies upon DWRs credit to fund these programs and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley as well as 400 MW generated by wind With the Current Glut of Contracts Why Do We Need Additional Reserves Kellan Flukinger Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing

public  Davis is likely losing his mind  Can Ron Carroll or Dan Watkiss search these filings down at FERC  Thanks Best Jeff State PUC seeks to void Daviss power contracts Deals gouge consumers agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine Californias hard-won control of the power market state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov Gray Davis The state Public Utilities Commission in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governors power strategy is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the states power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices and it wants some of those prices cut The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if theyre not renegotiated Commissioner Richard Bilas said I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Its definitely not something thats a favorable thing to have happen to us said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources which negotiated the contracts Hidalgo said the long-term contracts even though more expensive than current market prices are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out Hidalgo said If thats the goal then were back to square one Prices would start to creep up The state is paying an average of 69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators Peak prices for electricity last week were less than 30 Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned 125 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases Over the past three months lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc Alliance Colton LLC Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp subsidiary said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher SEMPRA CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements some of which last 20 years In all California has committed to spending at least 43 billion for electricity The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the 1 billion contract one of Davis energy consultants owned stock in the power suppliers parent company Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldnt comment until it had studied the PUC submissions The PUCs challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governors three appointees The commission has rebuffed Davis attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned 125 billion bond issue STATE TREASURERS WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUCs actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a 9 billion hole in the state budget next year PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer We should not through the instrument of the bonds lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years Lynch said last week We should stay as flexible as possible Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commissions challenges to the contracts Commissioner Jeff Brown Lynchs fellow Davis appointee said the filings dont rule out Davis bond financing deal Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts he said But federal action could help the state improve the deals he said The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract he said Even if we renegotiate well renegotiate within the confines of the contract Hidalgo however said he doubted the state could modify the contracts Under power granted by the Legislature he said the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable Jan Mitchell a spokeswoman for ScottishPower parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations Now another California agency is disputing it Mitchell said We obviously disagree and well continue to work with FERC making sure the contracts are honored PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year 1 billion deal with the company July 6 That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts the PUC says News reports suggest that the water department paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers the PUC said An energy consultant to Davis Vikram Budhraja admitted in August that he owned as much as 10000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out Budhraja sold the stock July 30 and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the states energy picture While the issue has slipped from the public eye Davis solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edisons finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing While officials fight among themselves the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation

State Senate I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness Unfortunately however the Senate has not gotten the job done It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3000 Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers We worked hard to bring this energy which was crucial in avoiding blackouts back on-line earlier this summer I will call a Third Extraordinary Session which will begin in approximately two weeks so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy Edison has assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its creditors will continue to show restraint California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility

httpwwwsfgatecomcgi-binarticlecgifnewsarchive20010915national0541EDT0485DTL 09-15 0257 PDT SACRAMENTO Calif AP --The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy and Gov Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session a 200 million program to help the states neediest schools won approval So did bills to give drivers licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds But senators remained cool to Davis idea of bailing out Southern California Edison They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly which also adjourned early Saturday We didnt take it up because we didnt want to embarrass the governor said President Pro Tem John Burton It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation The deals quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April saying the state would pay 276 billion for Edisons transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its 39 billion debt Without the deal Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co the states largest utility The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after amassing about 89 billion in debt due to last years sky-high electricity costs Edison says it has accrued 39 billion in debts The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday Unfortunately however the Senate has not gotten the job done The new school-improvement program would provide grants of 400 per student to schools with the states lowest test scores They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work tools paid for by the employer and toilets lights and water in housing It also would put into state law a 1050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders While legislators toiled Tuesdays terrorist attacks were never far from their minds Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks The Legislature approved sending 1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal Here in California our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance said Davis 2001 Associated Press

Rehearing Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commissions Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access  Although we have prevailed at least for now on the issue ofr etroactivity the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision it must file an application for rehearing within ten days  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28 meaning that it would be filed next Friday The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 17085f The Commissions reliance on material outside the record violates due process The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commissions authority The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority The Decisions purported findings are not supported The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort I look forward to seeing your comments

story  Should add to Davis migraines  Couldnt happen to a nicer guy  The pressure on the contracts is likely to heat up Best Jeff 8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals Energy The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long a study finds Immediate renegotiation is urged By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers September 30 2001 SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated according to a new detailed study The biggest problems are so-called take or pay clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it the study said The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price according to the analysis which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer environmental and renewable energy groups Between January and September the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the states three investor-owned utilities which have been unable to buy power on their own The longest of the contracts would last 20 years and overall the pacts are estimated to cost 43 billion over the next two decades Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts we will consider it said Joe Ronan a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp But he said the company has no intention of asking for renegotiation on its own Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers a trade association for electricity generating companies said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation So far he said I dont see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table Wed take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations he said For his part Gov Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations said his spokesman Steve Maviglio but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table Would we love to get a better deal Maviglio said Of course we would but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts wed be the first ones at the table S David Freeman who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements When the state began negotiating contracts California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat he said Insurance is insurance and it costs a little bit said Freeman but its a good thing to have But William B Marcus chief economist for JBS Energy which conducted the three-month study noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a 200000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation It was conducted by JBS a consulting group The study singled out for criticism  A deal with Sempra Energy parent company to San Diego Gas  Electric which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts Over the life of the pact he calculated Sempra would earn 12 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost The contract lasts until 2011 For each year it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether its needed or not  A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co that have yet to be built The plants will be peakers designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight such as on hot summer afternoons The state agreed to pay Calpine 90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity They get 90 million a year on plants that cost 250 million said Marcus Thats huge You get your money out in three years If a utility had built these power plants they would have charged half as much  A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County The deal commits the state to pay 207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity  An agreement to pay 150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of 69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area  A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp a private utility based in Portland Ore Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of 70 per megawatt-hour That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winters crisis but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed  Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts the study said One of the marketers Allegheny Energy Supply Co agreed to sell from 150 to 1000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight 61 per megawatt-hour But a second marketer Williams Energy Marketing  Trading Co got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for 6250 to 87 per megawatt-hour When you compare those two contracts Marcus said you know youve got a dog here I think Williams showed up earlier and the state was desperate  An agreement with Dynegy Corp of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firms California-based plants The contract puts no ceiling on those costs Marcus said and it is unclear how high they are likely to go  A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore The state agreed to a price of 58 per megawatt-hour but is obligated to take all of the power 24 hours a day seven days a week Marcus a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys He said 96 of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices The state has agreed to buy too much power often for too long a period at too high a price and much of this power is simply too dirty said V John White executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies To make matters worse almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel natural gas When the state began negotiating contracts in January electricity prices averaged 177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than 1000 per megawatt-hour By June the average price had fallen below 100 Lately prices hover around 30 per megawatt-hour similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003 The price of natural gas the main fuel used to run power plants in California began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring Another weakness of the contracts Marcus said is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas For the prices California will pay under these pacts residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper he said Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes he said Renewable sources

contempt finding By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published Sept 14 2001 State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929 Following hours of closed-door meetings Enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines Under the deal Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over It took too long to bring this to resolution said state Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana who chairs the committee I cant help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt As part of the deal however Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman Karen Denne She said the company is still considering its options Were pleased theyve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges Denne said Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11 The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds including those with specific details -- prices quantities and capacity -- of the companies transactions in the states wholesale electricity market Enron officials balked at the request saying they didnt want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets Ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate Thursday morning the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committees contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate along with suggested punishments in the form of fines After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences At 6 pm Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies In addition the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD was among 11

state reach agreement on papers The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market September 14 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents While delaying the decision Senate Leader John Burton D-San Francisco ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets Lets hope cooler minds prevail said Rules Committee member Sen Ross Johnson R-Irvine as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting The contempt proceedings for now have been dropped said Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nations two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California said Dunn who asked for the counsels review and recommendation Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS September 13 2001 SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committees quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt In June the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the states wholesale electricity market Enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected The judge agreed however that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana chairman of the select committee said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators With that agreement Dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt He asked Sen John Burton D-San Francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against Enron for each day they didnt comply with the subpoena The daily fines would start at 1000 doubling each day for 10 days Then the company would be fined 1 million a day Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them But Dennis Murphy a lawyer for the select committee said Enron didnt tell investigators where the depository was located The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case he said Weve been trying to get into the depository for a week They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said Kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents The two parties havent met since the judge ordered the protective order and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the orders details Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order Sen Ross Johnson R-Irvine said Dunns push to have Enron found in contempt smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate A contempt finding against Mirant Corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committees investigators If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron it will be the first time since 1929 when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state

Wednesday September 26 2001 252 PM To Friends of PennFuture Subject PennFutures E-Cubed - Straight to the Source PennFutures E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market ---------------------------------September 26 2001 Vol 3 No 18 Straight to the Source Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news Importantly the merger settlement provided 32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania This year the companys wholesale trading and marketing unit Power Team presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement and are not included in the 32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms two of which will be operational next month The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week Mike Freeman the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible gave us some insight into Exelons renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into Americas power grids ---------------------------------Whats in Power Teams renewable portfolio We have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage 150 MW of wind 100 MW of landfill methane 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste 20 MW of wood waste and 16 MW of scrap tires All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as new resources All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e but only 10 MW is new generation Of the hydro all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e but the biomass plant is Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio There were two principal reasons a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel emissions and cost Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business I dont think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases Part of the hands-off approach was due to I believe a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation not changing the power system in any way Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system For me thats the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable and that demand for these products could be sustaining Will this encourage new development Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location but is also willing to talk about additional new projects Over time other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same If this chain of events occurs I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter just like other energy products now How do renewables fit into Power Teams overall business strategy We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy More specifically we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards but also because of natural demand The average person may not think of it this way but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements Why Wind Theres no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998 and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand including supply-side and demand-side solutions We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal The first is probably the need for a long-term contract Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period We dont have a problem with long-term deals per se although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well We dont want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else In my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length In fact our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built Beyond the long-term contract the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating Exelon Generation is rated A- by SP so we are a natural counter-party for project financing Right now there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have Will that always will be the case No If were right about long-lasting demand I think other large companies including distribution companies will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects Weve teamed up with a retail marketer Community Energy to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it In the development of conventional generation it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built For example a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods And in some cases the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing Is there a financial advantage for wind If ones view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project outside of significant advances in technology Over a long period of time 15 or 20 years I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio With conventional generation and firm transmission paths a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets whether they are hourly daily monthly or longer Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing amount and ultimate sink of expected output The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100 of the time as possible so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesnt match scheduled energy The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio Were one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix How does intermittent generation add complexity A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency even for an experienced organization like ours because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind You dont have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand In PJM where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis and receive or pay market-clearing prices depending on actual generation wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties An obstacle and were working with PJM on this right now is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity For purposes of regulating the system PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand This will not be practical with wind generation Wed literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do In the must-run scenario wed still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators Either way wed have to predict output which is a dicey proposition Does that make wind generation unreliable Not at all Weve got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time such as a full year Those predictions underlie our contracts But its another thing to tell the wind when to blow The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what Ive described In PJM a 54000 MW system this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as negative load instead of generation Which is to say when the plant is generating electricity the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating When the plant is not generating the load will increase A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve In this unique circumstance which of the ancillary services apply to negative load and at what level Were working with PJM on these questions Im uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way Other countries and the western US transmission systems have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation and so can we Are you working on other approaches Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market to a control area that does have such a market The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment However notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach Will PJM resolve these problems Yes PJM is progressive and innovative and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the schedulingimbalance issue Its hard now because were breaking new ground I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed How big might your renewable portfolio get Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy well continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy Id like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market such as PJM to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on If we execute a contract successfully wed like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp and National Wind Power What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage Perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy ---------------------------------E-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Authors are available

Raising questions about the constitutionality of transferring rate-making authority from the Public Utilities Commission PUC to the Department of Water Resources DWR Secretary of State Bill Jones today expressed his outrage at the prospect of losing all public accountability and oversight of Californias electricity rate-setting process The PUC is expected to vote on Thursday September 20 2001 to accept a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer that would transfer its ratemaking authority to the DWR Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis setting rates without public oversight asked Jones  The Governors record on energy has been abysmal  He has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the states best interest to give Gray Davis and the DWR a blank check said Jones AB1X specifies that DWR be entitled to recover the costs of its energy purchases after advising the PUC of the costs  Most recently DWR has informed the PUC that their purchases for energy through 2002 will reach 126 billion  If the PUC accepts the draft decision DWR will now be the state agency making the determination of whether its own purchase costs are just and reasonable Pure and simple its a rate scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional  If the PUC refuses to do so California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the DWR said Jones - MORE -BJC272 As our state weathers this energy challenge and faces great economic uncertainty with a budget deficit looming in the future never before has it been so important for the PUC to responsibly perform its vital oversight duties acting in the best interest of Californians said former Governor George Deukmejian who joined Jones and past PUC Commissioner Stan Hulett today in criticizing the pending PUC action As a former California Attorney General Deukmejian also expressed strong concerns regarding the legality of the PUCs abdication of authority The PUCs power to review rate increases is a power expressly granted to it in our California Constitution  The Legislature cannot simply delegate this power to another state agency by passing a simple statute  This transfer of power can only legally occur if a constitutional amendment is passed and AB1X is not a constitutional amendment said Deukmejian Former PUC President and Commissioner Stan Hulett also raised serious questions regarding the shift of constitutional responsibilities from the PUC to the DWR Even something as seemingly innocuous as relocating the PUCs headquarters from San Francisco to Sacramento would require a constitutional amendment according to the opinion we received from former Attorney General John Van de Camp when that issues arose some years ago Hulett said  A shift of responsibility of this magnitude would clearly and unambiguously require a constitutional amendment given the enormity of the proposal Secretary Jones implored the PUC to suspend action on the draft decision until these extraordinary constitutional questions are addressed California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government  For all our sakes and for the future of our state we must not allow that to happen said Jones - 30 -Remarks by Secretary of State Bill Jones Regarding the Unconstitutional Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the Public Utilities Commission to the Department of Water Resources As Prepared Good morning Thank you for being here today   As you know tomorrow the California Public Utilities Commission will be voting on an extremely important issue that will affect all Californians for years to come The PUC will consider abdicating its ratemaking responsibilities to the Department of Water Resources based upon a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer I am here today because I have grave concerns that if the PUC adopts this decision they will be violating a major provision of Californias Constitution As California searches for ways to deal with our continuing energy situation it is incumbent upon each of us to examine the ramifications - both short and long term - of every decision we make  This past weekend the California Legislature chose not to bring legislation affecting the pending bankruptcy of Southern California Edison because many members of the legislature believed that the legislation was severely flawed Lets examine for a minute why this issue and vote will be taken tomorrow  This decision rests wholly on the new rate scheme embodied in Assembly Bill 1X AB1X Since January of this year the DWR has purchased electrical power on behalf of cash and credit poor Southern California Edison SCE Pacific Gas and Electric PGE and San Diego Gas and Electric SDGE  AB1X granted this authority to DWR AB1X specifies that DWR is entitled to recover the cost of these purchases and that DWR is to advise the PUC of this amount  DWR has recently estimated that it will require 126 billion to cover the costs of power purchased through 2002 AB1X further stipulates that the PUC will approve rates designed by DWR and paid by the consumers to cover DWRs expenditures for its energy purchases Under the law as laid out in AB1X DWR and not the PUC will make the determination as to whether its purchase costs of 126 billion are just and reasonable under the law Pure and simple it is a scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional If the PUC refuses to do so California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the Department of Water Resources This is a dramatic and extremely troubling break from the current role of the PUC  For decades the PUC has aggressively performed the vital task of oversight through public hearings to ensure that rates charged Californias electrical energy users are just and reasonable  Now that indispensable oversight authority would be delegated to a bureaucratic state agency the DWR with no public oversight and no independent decision making authority Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis setting rates without public oversight  The Governors record on energy has been abysmal and he has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the states interest to give Gray Davis a blank checkbook DWR and Gray Davis would become the sole arbiter of whether the cost of their own energy purchases has been just and reasonable Through AB1X the Legislature has diminished the PUCs role so greatly that its function is to simply allocate shares of the 126 billion revenue requirement to the three utilities This is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house - it must not happen The PUC must not vote to accept this illegal transfer of authority The PUC must vigorously defend its role  It must not allow the Legislature to abolish the crucial role it performs reviewing the reasonableness of the overall purchase costs before they are passed along to ratepayers As I noted earlier the reimbursement scheme set forth in AB1X is a violation of Californias Constitution The Legislatures attempt to strip public accountability for the reasonableness of rate increases from the PUC and give it to DWR is appalling  Nowhere in AB1X is it specified what a reasonableness review conducted by DWR will now be Will senior officials at DWR and Governor Davis gather at a conference table behind locked doors and declare their own power purchases reasonable Will they hold public hearings and subject their expenditures of billions of dollars belonging to the people of California to the scrutiny of the people of California Looking at their track record the answer is no The PUCs power to review rate increases is not merely based on statute  It is explicitly set out in the California Constitution This is a very critical distinction The Legislature cannot transfer or delegate this critical power by a simple statute It can only be done by constitutional amendment And AB1X is not a constitutional amendment According to California Courts the PUC is not an ordinary administrative agency but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers Article XII section 6 of the California Constitution states the general grant of authority for the PUC to fix rates Section 6 provides The commission may fix rates establish rules examine records issue subpoenas administer oaths take testimony punish for contempt and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction Thus the Constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities including the power to fix rates establish rules hold various types of hearings award reparation and establish its own procedures This is basic California law reaffirmed time after time by our courts These constitutional powers are based firmly on the authority to make factual inquiry into the reasonableness of the rates to be fixed  In one notable case PGE v Railroad Comm the federal court reviewed natural gas rates set by the Railroad Commission predecessor to the PUC  The court discussed the duties of the ratemaking body to make sure that the rates it fixes be reasonable Because the PUC has the authority to fix rates it therefore has a corollary duty to make sure that the rates it fixes are reasonable This must mean that there is a constitutional duty and right to examine the costs underlying those rates  AB1X cannot alter or eliminate that duty  AB1X also cannot strip the core component of any reasonableness review the close and open-minded examination of those facts being used to justify a rate increase The Legislature cannot deny the PUC these constitutional powers By depriving the PUC the authority to examine underlying costs in the exercise of its duty to fix rates the Legislature has improperly sought to modify curtail and abridge the constitutional powers of the PUC  To that extent AB1X is invalid and unconstitutional In a startling break with Californias past history AB1X allows DWR to retain title to the energy it purchases and then resell it directly to consumers The utilities then collect the energy costs from their retail customers and return to DWR the portion of the revenues DWR has said it must have as reimbursement By any other name this is a tax It is an enormous sum of money being paid out by the people of California According to our courts the power to set taxes is a legislative function  DWR is an agency within the executive branch of government The California Constitution specifies that the powers of one branch shall not be exercised by another branch The following example highlights the impropriety of the Legislatures delegation of authority to DWR to determine the reasonableness of its own energy purchases The Legislature assesses Californias highway and transportation needs and then sets the rate for the gasoline tax Drivers purchasing gas in California pay the tax on a cents per gallon basis whenever they buy gas The Legislature cannot delegate to CalTrans the authority both to determine its own highway construction budget and to set a gasoline tax rate calculated to fund that budget This situation is identical to DWR The Legislature has directed DWR to purchase power as it needs at prices it is willing to pay The Legislature has further directed the PUC to authorize rates without any review to determine their reasonableness in order to reimburse DWR The PUC cannot legally - and must not under any circumstances -- abdicate its responsibilities to the people of California This is a decision based on the unconstitutional scheme laid out in AB1X and its unconscionable for the PUC to vote away its own most precious function providing accountability for just and reasonable rates for the people of California For these reasons I cannot urge in stronger terms that the PUC take the following actions tomorrow on the draft decision 1      Suspend action on the draft decision until the extraordinary constitutional questions are resolved 2      Seek immediate resolution of these constitutional questions by initiating a lawsuit against the Legislature and the Governor 3      Adopt regulatory and statutory changes to ensure that public oversight and accountability for just and reasonable rates continues California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government  For all of our sakes and the future of our state this must not be allowed to happen -

Dasovich Jeff Non-PrivilegedDasovich JeffSent Items X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst See story below State completes historys largest municipal-bond sale Californias treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in US history Tuesday -- a 57 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the states energy crisis The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited 125 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the states budget in the next fiscal year With the Sept 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1 2002 The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis could force Draconian budget cuts Angelides said We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003 he said and that was before the tragedy of Sept 11 Now if falling revenues are added to the 6 billion hole well have deficits akin to the early 1990s Angelides said noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services Earlier this year the state advanced 62 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas  Electric Co Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the 125 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday This year weve been taken to court probably five times more than weve been taken to court last year partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because its been trying to make them so fast she said But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002 Besides raising the budget concerns that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year he said citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action Tuesdays bond sale to meet the states cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes The notes are fixtures on Californias cash-flow landscape In 1993-94 for example the state sold 8 billion through multiple offerings No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus But a year earlier in fiscal 1999-2000 1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record Tuesdays sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes Tuesdays debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers It speaks to overall quality of the states credit and the way the state is perceived particularly in light of Sept 11 said Peter Taylor senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros As senior manager on the sale Taylor and Lehman Bros coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms There was wide acceptance from a range of investors retail buyers mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations Taylor said The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than 2 billion That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 225 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state an annualized 222 percent The notes mature June 28 2002 Overall yield counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance is only 217 percent Had the 62 billion in general-fund money been repaid Angelides said the need for Tuesdays short-term debt issuance would have been substantially less  if not eliminated Even so Angelides said the state was fortunate to move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year

about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before That sale reported by the California Independent System Operator and confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on Californias power crisis On Monday the Department of Water Resources the agency that has been purchasing Californias bulk power needs in lieu of the states cash-strapped utilities released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the LADWP charged the state an average of 242 a megawatt-hour for power from Jan 18 through May 31 this year That price is about 35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators Gov Gray Davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration however is that the LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman who in April became Davis top energy adviser Steve Maviglio press secretary to Davis said Texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the states two largest utilities Anywhere they wear cowboy hats they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind he said The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators Freemans trademark is a white Stetson The former LADWP chief who last September quipped that a blind pig could make money under Californias faulty deregulation setup didnt return calls for comment Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state Power To Sell According to the DWR report the LADWP brought in 331 million selling power to the state between Jan 18 and May 31 this year The LADWP which didnt take part in the states deregulation debacle and which isnt under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators also cashed in throughout 2000 The utility has 7000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5500 MW to serve its retail customers freeing it to sell as much as 1000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators were charging The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down 200 million in debt and will reduce its customers rates in 2002 It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it Freeman said in an interview last year Last July ratings agency Fitch concluded that Californias electricity shortage provided LADWP an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal systems coffers According to a report by the ISO manager of the states electricity grid the LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001 by as much as 20 million Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility On Tuesday an LADWP spokesman defended the utilitys power prices saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly 9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001 On Monday settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down Other municipal utilities including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to California at the last minute -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjonescom END Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01 1557EDT AP-DJ--07-10-01 1557EDT TICKER EIX PCG SRE SUBJECT EUTL CA COBO MU PETR Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones and Company Inc Received by NewsEDGELAN 71001 1257 PM

Stull Stull  Brody and Bernstein Liebhard  Lifshitz LLP - filed class-action suits against Enron Lay Fastow and Jeffrey K Skilling the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August The suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information that materially misstated the companys condition and prospects to the investing public Moreover the suits argue that the company failed to disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not misleading The complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business financial results and operations which failed to disclose among other things  The companys Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the companys efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy  The companys operating results were materially overstated since Enron failed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships - the partnerships that were managed by Fastow  Enron was failing to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP Read On For More of Today in Finance httpmsmaildartnetlink30322654328811200863737394146107a FROM OUR FEATURED ADVERTISER  Save on e-billing  With 25000 off the top From now until Nov 2 2001 you can sign up for the industry-leading OpenBill Express e-billing system and receive implementation free -

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE09September 20 2001 CONTACT PGE News Department 415 973-5930 PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PGE CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI ZATION20 Plan Pays Claims in Full Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State  Bailout San Francisco CA- PGE Corporation NYSE PCG and its utility unit Paci fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in US Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p roceedings The official creditors committee supports the plan This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi tioned to continue safe reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr icity to its customers pay all valid creditor claims in full and do so wi thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman CEO and Pr esident of PGE Corporation  And the plan will enable us to provide long -term growth prospects to shareholders 20 The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation  into two separate stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot her The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own  and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste m  The electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmi ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p art of PGE Corporation The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a nd Electric will be distributed to PGE Corporation shareholders The electric generation electric transmission and gas transmission operati ons when reorganized as new businesses under PGE Corporation will have t he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors claims The plan also re structures certain existing debt and uses 33 billion in cash on hand to s atisfy creditor claims20 Under the plan all valid creditor claims will be paid in full using a com bination of cash and long-term notes  In total the plan will provide cred itors with about 91 billion in cash and 41 billion in notes The vast m ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of 100000 or less-will rec eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec tive date of the plan  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen t of their allowed claims in cash  Finally unsecured creditors with allow ed claims in excess of the 100000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca sh and 40 percent in notes 09Following the restructuring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE  Corporation will be organized as follows20 09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i ts customers in Northern and Central California  It will hold 70 percent o f the current utility assets in terms of book value and will employ 1600 0 people  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans 20 09PGE Corporation in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus iness will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri c generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company20 The new electric generation business will be a California company establish ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a ssociated lands and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district s now held by the utility  In total the unit will have approximately 71 00 megawatts of generation  The facilities will be operated in accordance  with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and in ke eping with sound environmental stewardship policies  The generating busine ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com pany under a 12-year contract at a stable market-based rate20 The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u tility  The system comprises 18500 circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables The new gas transmission business will be a California company established  to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b y the utility including 6300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga s storage facilities 20 Following the reorganization the California Public Utilities Commission wi ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company i ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates  The Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses  for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of servic e provided by the electric transmission business  FERC will also assume ju risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear  Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service for the ga s transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline 20 Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reli able and long-term electric supply to California customers  It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce  And it enables us to keep our  generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga nization20 We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said  Glynn  We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t he people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for cu stomers and employees the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta te  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R esources The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately  be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented20 Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito rs said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r esolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness  It has our f ull support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte r 11 process20 With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Cha pter 11 process to completion reaffirming the financial health and creditw orthiness of our operations through this reorganization restoring customer s confidence and rebuilding value for our shareholders -

that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed or whether i f confirmed it will become effective some of the factors that could affec t the outcome materially include the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi ngs the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified legislative and r egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect ric and natural gas industries in the United States particularly in Califo rnia whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or  whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all risks re lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated  entities including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe d claims and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due  to among other reasons an adverse change in market conditions or in the c ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings  whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to pre-empt relevant n on-bankruptcy law and if so whether and the extent to which such assertion of jurisdiction is successfully challenged whether a favorable tax ruling or opinion is obtained regarding the tax-free nature of the internal restr ucturings and  spin off contemplated by the Plan and the ability of the Ut ility to successfully disaggregate its businesses20 Please visit our websites wwwpgecorpcom and wwwpgecom

Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published Sept 14 2001 State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929 Following hours of closed-door meetings Enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines Under the deal Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over It took too long to bring this to resolution said state Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana who chairs the committee I cant help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt As part of the deal however Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman Karen Denne She said the company is still considering its options Were pleased theyve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges Denne said Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11 The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds including those with specific details -- prices quantities and capacity -- of the companies transactions in the states wholesale electricity market Enron officials balked at the request saying they didnt want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets Ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate Thursday morning the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committees contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate along with suggested punishments in the form of fines After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences At 6 pm Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies In addition the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at 916 326-5540 or ebazarsacbeecom mailtoebazarsacbeecom Enron and state reach agreement on papers The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market September 14 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents While delaying the decision Senate Leader John Burton D-San Francisco ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets Lets hope cooler minds prevail said Rules Committee member Sen Ross Johnson R-Irvine as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting The contempt proceedings for now have been dropped said Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nations two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California said Dunn who asked for the counsels review and recommendation Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS September 13 2001 SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committees quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt In June the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the states wholesale electricity market Enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected The judge agreed however that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana chairman of the select committee said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators With that agreement Dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt He asked Sen John Burton D-San Francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against Enron for each day they didnt comply with the subpoena The daily fines would start at 1000 doubling each day for 10 days Then the company would be fined 1 million a day Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them But Dennis Murphy a lawyer for the select committee said Enron didnt tell investigators where the depository was located The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case he said Weve been trying to get into the depository for a week They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said Kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents The two parties havent met since the judge ordered the protective order and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the orders details Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order Sen Ross Johnson R-Irvine said Dunns push to have Enron found in contempt smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate A contempt finding against Mirant Corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committees investigators If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron it will be the first time since 1929 when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging

which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators all of which were to attend th e meeting20 Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu res of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine mont hs are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st ructure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to dev elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and pr ocedures20 ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC20 The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines wh ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from 20 If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an au dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated  the market Wolfmans office said20 As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud it of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement  division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could  lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated20 The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po wer first20 The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe r at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the  second letter says20 The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and decl ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays me eting20 Generators Confused20 Generators including Mirant Corp  MIR httpquickenexcitecominvestm entsquotessymbol3DMIR news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnew ssymbol3DMIR msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymb ol3DMIR Reliant Energy Inc  REI httpquickenexcitecominvestment squotessymbol3DREI news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnews symbol3DREI msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol 3DREI Williams Cos  WMB httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotes symbol3DWMB news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol 3DWMB msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DWMB  Duke Energy  DUK httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol 3DDUK news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DDUK m sgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DDUK and Dyne gy Inc  DYN httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3DDYN news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3DDYN msgs htt pquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3DDYN have bought app arently inexpensive power in the ISOs spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher Thats because according to the allegatio ns the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as out-o f-market purchases that arent averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see20 DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISOs request DW R operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs long-term contracts20 The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive however According to t he ISOs August market report the average out-of-market price for peak hou rs was 5590 a megawatt-hour compared with 2649MWh on the ISO computer ized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th e out-of-market prices for months20 None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record20 The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Ca lif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meet ing isnt open to the public20 The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and  operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro ve the market20 The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to  by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra ctices Wolfman said in the letter20 -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjone scom mailtojasonleopolddowjonescom

Unintended Consequences -- POWER POINTSNevada Suffers FERC Unintended Consequences     By Mark Golden     A Dow Jones Newswires Column    NEW YORK Dow Jones--Those who have opposed wholesale electricity pric e  controls have been labeled as extreme free-market ideologues who are  insensitive  to the practical impacts on peoples lives of high electricity prices    But the most common argument against price caps has been logical not  ideological Price controls have never worked Market participants always  find a  way around the rules    This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided that it will  have  to consider at its meeting next week revisions to its June 19 price  control  ruling The initial price cap rule set by the California Independent  System  Operator last spring was only a few paragraphs long Each successive  price cap  order has gotten longer though effectiveness still appears out of reach  The  FERCs April order was 28 pages long the June order was 48 pages And no w  additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes    The revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the  June  order During a spell of very hot weather Monday Sierra Pacific Resource s  SRP  subsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a  small  number of customers for 45 minutes The company attributed the blackouts  in  part to the new price controls    Sierra Pacifics chief spokesman Paul Heagen provided a birds eye  view of  the practical realities of the FERCs new price cap regime    Power Points After having a few days to look into it can you say that  price  caps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday    Paul Heagen Yes but first let me say that all of it was unintentional  FERC  was trying to do the right thing Price caps were a noble effort to solve  a real  problem in California    But on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function It had  neither  and that can be attributed to the price caps Normally in one or two  phone  calls we could have got what we needed On Monday we were five to six  calls  into it and still on the phone    Price caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other  states into  the California morass We have this artificial environment which we are  all  trying to sort through    PP How specifically are the caps having this effect    PH There are a couple of elements The 10 premium for power sold to  California is supposed to reflect concerns about credit That 10 in an  open  market is no big deal but in a constrained situation the seller will gra b  it  because now its his only chance to make money    Also the way this is set up they look backwards They determine the  price  after the fact I cant think of any business in the world where you sell  a  product and find out later what price you sold at    This had a very chilling effect on peoples willingness to sell  Normally a  cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in th e  real-time market Normally those little 50-megawatt packets move pretty  easily  and thats really important for maintaining reliability    With the price cap utilities hunkered down Selling at 92 wasnt wort h  the  risk They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it    Also we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share  savings  with customers who agree to curtail use If the market is say 500 we  might  pay them 250MWh to curtail demand But in a 92mkt we can offer them  such a  small amount of money that they stay on    PP Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price  controls    PH Weve had a senior team in Washington DC at the FERC since last  week  Right away we saw another effect of the FERC order It penalizes companie s  like  ours that signed long-term supply contracts before the order because many  of  those deals were done at prices above the price cap    The biggest issue for us is did FERC really mean to penalize companie s  like  us that planned ahead Its long-term contracts that provide price  stability    Its unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for long-term  contracts  that have been undercut by price caps If we get into a situation where w e  have  a little extra to sell now we cant recover our costs    PP With such high prices the past year a lot of small oil-fired  turbines  have been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer Trader s  for  other southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have  been  very helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year but they weren t  available this week because they cost more to run than the price cap Did  you  see the same thing    PH We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe  area in  the last few months They were supposed to provide peak power but they  get  uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme    You know weve tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the  California situation and behave very independent of how California  behaves So  Nevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effec t  outside of California We were able to minimize the impact on our  customers  Monday but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on  the  impact of price caps

Interestingly no mention of the transfer of the gas assets Best Jeff PGE restructuring bid draws state ire By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers Published Sept 21 2001 In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy Pacific Gas and Electric Co proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utilitys valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants To make the plan work PGE asked a US bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials PGE said the plan a complicated blend of asset transfers debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs would restore the utilitys financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state bailout Divorcing the utility from its parent company the plan would pay off the entire 132 billion of debt PGE accumulated during Californias poorly executed era of deregulation The plan filed in US Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco had the support of a key block of creditors including independent energy generators whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov Gray Davis and other state officials setting up a potentially fierce battle Despite PGEs claims to the contrary they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PGE could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has proven over the last 18 months to be  no friend of the ratepayer Davis told reporters Thursday The PUC while far from perfect has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  Im very wary of PGEs proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court I dont think the judge is going to do it said PUC President Loretta Lynch Consumer advocates noted that PGE has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants Its complete piracy said Nettie Hoge head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco Its the most audacious thing Ive ever seen Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection the plan calls for PGE to be spun off from PGE Corp but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent That would violate a state law passed as a response to the energy crisis prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006 The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PGE and Southern California Edison PGE acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law Legal experts said its not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law and in prior rulings US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws said influential state Sen Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey chair of the Senate Energy Committee Robert D Glynn Jr PGEs chairman called the transfer a good deal for customers He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about 50 a megawatt hour -- the lower end of current rates -- under a 12-year contract But thats almost double the existing rates for those plants critics said And Gary Cohen the PUCs general counsel said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent unregulated generator This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with Cohen said Despite the friction between PGE and the state the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers regardless of how high they go Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization PGE said The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a yes vote from a majority of PGEs creditors along with Montali Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002 enabling the utility to resume buying electricity The state has been buying power for PGE since January when it became insolvent While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year the reorganization plan doesnt require another rate hike Glynn insisted From the customers view this transaction will be seamless he said The same should be true for most employees he said The PGE chairman whose company has feuded with Davis for months also boasted that PGE isnt asking the state for a bailout or a rescue -- a jab at Davis as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison Its unclear what impact PGEs proposal would have on Edisons attempt to avoid bankruptcy Edisons creditors already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court analysts said The PGE proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PGE Corp split into two separate publicly-traded companies The utility company Pacific Gas and Electric would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PGE Corp for 406 billion in cash and IOUs PGE Corp shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility although the details of the stock transaction havent been worked out The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PGE has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment Despite the criticism PGE said removing those assets from regulators oversight is essential to making the plan work Why Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets said utility spokesman Ron Low If the assets became property of PGE Corp the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts Glynn said hes had in-depth discussions with investment bankers about issuing new bonds Also by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard  Poors Corp in New York If state officials fight the plan the question arises How do you discharge these debts  Bodek said Heres a plan that does that The plan would pay creditors 91 billion in cash and 41 billion in bonds Creditors with debts of more than 100000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds which will be paid in 10 or more years said Paul Aronzon attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors Theres some credibility here and it works Aronzon said of the plan Gary Ackerman a spokesman for independent generators said his group would probably accept the plan even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money Shareholders also endorsed the plan PGE Corps stock jumped 122 to 1572 on a day when the markets took another bad fall

about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before That sale reported by the California Independent System Operator and confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on Californias power crisis On Monday the Department of Water Resources the agency that has been purchasing Californias bulk power needs in lieu of the states cash-strapped utilities released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the LADWP charged the state an average of 242 a megawatt-hour for power from Jan 18 through May 31 this year That price is about 35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators Gov Gray Davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration however is that the LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman who in April became Davis top energy adviser Steve Maviglio press secretary to Davis said Texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the states two largest utilities Anywhere they wear cowboy hats they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind he said The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators Freemans trademark is a white Stetson The former LADWP chief who last September quipped that a blind pig could make money under Californias faulty deregulation setup didnt return calls for comment Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state Power To Sell According to the DWR report the LADWP brought in 331 million selling power to the state between Jan 18 and May 31 this year The LADWP which didnt take part in the states deregulation debacle and which isnt under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators also cashed in throughout 2000 The utility has 7000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5500 MW to serve its retail customers freeing it to sell as much as 1000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators were charging The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down 200 million in debt and will reduce its customers rates in 2002 It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it Freeman said in an interview last year Last July ratings agency Fitch concluded that Californias electricity shortage provided LADWP an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal systems coffers According to a report by the ISO manager of the states electricity grid the LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001 by as much as 20 million Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility On Tuesday an LADWP spokesman defended the utilitys power prices saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly 9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001 On Monday settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down Other municipal utilities including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to California at the last minute -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjonescom END Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01 1557EDT AP-DJ--07-10-01 1557EDT TICKER EIX PCG SRE SUBJECT EUTL CA COBO MU PETR Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones and Company Inc Received by NewsEDGELAN 71001 1257 PM

Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM 09 09 09 09 WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bushs a pproach to energy and the environment Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle w ants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda before other init iatives popular with Democrats  Daschles aides and party strategists say  the Senates top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive d raw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation an d alternate power sources and inoculate his party against Republicans cha rges that it has ignored the countrys energy needs Activists on both side s see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sig n 09 09 With summer and gas prices and air conditioning -- this is what you g o with said Democratic pollster Fred Yang Its an issue that people act ually live every day There are very few issues like that in politics  De mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus h is handling energy and environmental issues  Whats more the House of R epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and  gas off Floridas gulf coast and in the Great Lakes Both measures passed w ith support from 70 Republicans  When the Republican-controlled House sou ndly rejects key components of the presidents energy policy it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center sa id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn  The decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c ommittees Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum  wage hate-crimes legislation a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth er issues popular with their supporters  But concentrating on energy polic y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican  issue and turn it to their advantage aides said  Bush and Vice President  Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen From th e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ y needs of the United States Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden  to special interests  The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce nt end of public opinion on this a top Democratic leadership aide who sp oke on condition of anonymity said this week Its a loser every day for  the Republicans  With that in mind Daschle and Sen Jeff Bingaman the N ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senates energy and natural resources comm ittee plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July I t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in  May  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex t week when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme nt Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands  The White House helped  defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac k its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico But huge disagreements remain o ver drilling in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a centerpiece of  Bushs energy plan Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge  Democrats a lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming One proposal which combines conservati on and anti- pollution goals would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor t utility vehicles The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi s month  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans giving Daschle  extra manpower to challenge Bush Democrats can count on New England Republ icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co llins both of Maine to back several Democratic initiatives  Sen John Mc Cain R-Ariz who already has opposed Bush on the patients bill of rights and campaign finance legislation also has said he favors more conservatio n measures than the White House proposes  Hell be very prominent in cobb ling a centrist coalition on the issue said Marshall Wittman a senior fe llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a dviser to McCain You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc ouragement of conservation some exploration but everything is environment ally friendly  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it s energy policies Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend ing for renewable energy but Bush restored some of the money later He als o has paid more attention to energy conservation indicating support for sp ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget  But the president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee ds to become less dependent on foreign oil And that White House officials say requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States The energ y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f or research into alternative energy sources  In addition to public disappr oval of his stands on the environment and energy the president is losing t he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals Rollin g blackouts in California are on the wane gasoline prices are falling and  last week John Browne the chief executive of BP oil dismissed Bushs call for new oil refineries  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue  and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui ck solutions  Its a target of opportunity said Burdett Loomis a polit ical scientist at the

X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst FYI Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away Best Jeff PUC Chiefs Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal Politics Insisting on her agencys independence Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a 33-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway I will take responsibility Lynch said Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal Lynch defied the governor Tuesday She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year Davis condemned the vote as an irresponsible act Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act Lynch however is not easily controlled She has moved ahead without the governors approval several times Most notably last spring she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike Such actions have made her perhaps Davis least favorite appointee And yet Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis single most pressing issue how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January For months those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury Unless a way is found to close it Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a 125-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries A top aide speaking on the condition of anonymity described the governors relationship with Lynch who once served on Davis staff as nonexistent But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner but he cant remove commissioners said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two We are in a position where were going to have to negotiate A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration Lynch worked on Davis 1998 campaign helping him raise money He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning then placing her on the PUC in late 1999 Lynch has taken seriously the idea enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC that the commission is supposed to be independent She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code written 90 years ago and concluding that Progressive Gov Hiram Johnson envisioned an independent agency independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor that would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing Before I was on Davis staff and as staff you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss Lynch said Now I was appointed to an independent constitutional body While I feel Ive built bridges to the governor and the Legislature I take very seriously the PUCs constitutional independence Critics including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature call Lynch unbending She is particularly adamant on the commissions independence Insisting on Independence Accounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynchs insistence on preserving the PUCs independent authority The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal Starting in April when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature Davis had no Republican support and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats Lynch was another skeptic Davis proposal would have weakened the PUCs authority to regulate Edison Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton D-San Francisco an ally of Lynchs and the most influential critic of the governors proposal Davis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly But late on Sept 14 the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again Lynch seized an opportunity She wanted to escape a 55-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edisons debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers It was a good time to talk Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly interest rates were falling and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility When we looked at the numbers fresh we realized that the numbers had changed enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout Lynch said At her direction PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison Edison PUC Started Secret Talks Edison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utilitys problems In their view past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature both sides met Sept 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utilitys private counsel Munger Tolles  Olson Talks went on for 12 days The PUC had three conditions One we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period Cohen said Second there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders And third there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commissions regulatory authority Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy they feared Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edisons problem Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners whose support she would need to pull off a settlement PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board said Lynch told him Sept 21 in the strictest confidence about the negotiations with Edison If it became public it could blow up Brown said There would be too much hullabaloo For several days however Lynch did not inform Davis Meanwhile the governors aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise On Sept 25 some of Davis top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session By the end of the meeting both sides realized a major gulf remained That same day Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway A few lawmakers also were told Two days later the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal Over the next several days the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the 33-billion rescue plan finalizing a deal about 11 pm Sept 30 It would not have gotten over the finish line without her said attorney Ron Olson an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks While those negotiations were going on Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commissions plate his proposal for the bond deal The issue is complex But at its root Lynch said the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUCs authority The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administrations power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her He did not call Lynch but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque The governors lobbying changed no votes his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynchs standing among her fellow commissioners including the two Republicans who are appointees of former Gov Pete Wilson Commissioners Praise Lynch In Bilas view the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal even if it might cost her her job as PUC president There are only two kinds of people who can serve a yes man or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent and she is of the second type Bilas said Brown the only commissioner to vote for the administrations bond proposal credits Lynch as well She stood up for the authority of the PUC Brown said Brown--a cousin of Davis onetime boss former Gov Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her He has not been offered the post and does not want it Brown said I hope they dont remove her as president Brown said She is a feisty independent individual

Newswires Calif Power Consultant Failed To Reveal Energy Co Stake By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES -- A top energy consultant hired by to negotiate long-term power contracts for the state of California failed to disclose that he held stock in a company with which the state signed a 1 billion power supply pact last month according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires Vikram Budraja filed an amended financial disclosure form Aug 13 listing holdings of between 2000 and 10000 in stock in ScottishPower SPI whose subsidiary PacifiCorp Power Marketing signed a 1 billion 10-year power contract with the state Department of Water Resources on July 6 Budraja failed to disclose the information in a form he filed in July after energy consultants hired by Gov Gray Davis came under fire for failing to file routine financial disclosure forms Budrajas August economic disclosure form states that he sold his ScottishPower shares July 30 on the advice of his lawyer He purchased the shares pre-96 according to the form Daviss office has sent a copy of Budrajas amended filing to the states Fair Political Practices Committee for review said Bill Kissinger Deputy Legal Affairs adviser for Davis The FPPC is conducting an investigation into a handful of the DWRs consultants who held stock in energy companies while working on behalf of the state buying power and negotiating contracts Kissinger said The DWR which is handling the job of buying power in lieu of Californias insolvent utilities said Budraja didnt negotiate the contract with PacifiCorp The department disclosed the contract on Aug 17 Stephen Kaufman a lawyer representing the Electric Power Group and Budraja also said Budraja didnt help negotiate the contract Kaufman added that Budrajas ScottishPower holdings were tied up in an IRA and that Budraja hadnt even realized he held stock in the company until a review of his financial records was undertaken recently A decision was made upon reviewing all of Mr Budrajas assets to disclose this to the public given all the activities going on and the press accounts Kaufman said The signing of the contract was of no consequence in deciding whether or not it should be sold This was a very small holding that was part of an IRA purchased prior to 1996 He did not remember or realize he had this holding until after this situation blew up and took a look at all of his holdings Political Battle Continues Budraja included the following comment with his renewed filing The information contained in the two previously filed form 700s was provided pursuant to a series of instructions provided by the Department of Water Resources starting on June 15 2001 that my disclosure should reflect the facts that existed on the date you first began working for the California Energy Resources Scheduling Budraja wrote referring to the Department of Water Resources power-buying arm This amended form is filed to list information not previously provided based upon consultation with and advice of legal counsel regarding the disclosure required by the Political Reform Act The disclosure is the latest in a battle over possible conflicts of interest waged by Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis a Democrat next year for governor Jones began pressing consultants hired by Davis administration in July to disclose their shareholdings in energy companies Once they did Jones asked federal and state regulators to investigate possible insider trading and conflicts of interest Budraja a former Edison International EIX vice president is one of the states two main power-contract negotiators Electric Power Group is under contract to plan and execute the DWRs power purchases and to help coordinate between the agency and other state offices His firm has 10 employees under contract to the DWR Electric Power Group is to receive 62 million for those services through Dec 31 2002 As reported investigators with the US Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Budrajas shareholdings The consultant has confirmed receiving a letter from the SEC informing him of the inquiry and asking him to supply information regarding his investments as of Jan 1 In July Budraja disclosed holding in Edison International and Dynegy Inc DYN both of which he sold after he began working for the state The states contract with PacifiCorp was negotiated by Richard Ferreira the former Sacramento Municipal Utility District executive and a representative from Navigant consulting said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo Ferreira was fired in late July because he held stock in Calpine Corp CPN while negotiating long-term contracts with the company according to Davis office The Republican leadership in the state Legislature has called for oversight hearings into the states 43 billion in long-term power contracts as well as its spot-market purchases The Democratic majority has yet to respond to the

BoardENRON Sent	Tuesday October 02 2001 424 PM To	All Enron WorldwideENRON Subject	Lay It On the Line Survey Results Recently I asked you to Lay It On the Line and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address  Many of you responded and I want to share the survey results with you  Additionally I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward First lets take a look at the survey results In just three days more than 4000 employees completed the survey  I sincerely appreciate your participation I  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today  The responses were 1	Stock price 2	The PRC 3	Employeeinternal morale 4	External reputation and image 5	Walking the talk of integrity and respect II  We asked you general questions about working at Enron comparing 2001 to 2000  of employees responding strongly agreeagree I am committed to staying at Enron	641 Enron is a company I would invest my money in	601 I am treated with respect	600 I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family	591 I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing	547 Enron truly encourages people to take risks	475 My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there	466 Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there	416 III  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron comparing 2001 to 2000 More	Same	Less	NA Concerned for communities	345	449	103	103 Innovative	308	357	246	89 Entrepreneurial	285	378	237	100 Ethical	170	451	281	98 Trustworthy	149	390	369	92 Arrogant	391	324	133	152 Self-serving	419	386	75	120 IV  Finally we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron 1	People the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2	Culture and reputation ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3	Work environment ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward  The following are some of the things were doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback Now heres what were going to do based on your feedback STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include ---	A decline in the overall market and economy ---   Certain Enron-specific issues such as California India and recent management turnover ---   A meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as 30-40 of our stock price at the high ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has Enron  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve ---	Over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward ---	Mark Koenig executive vice president of Investor Relations will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions --- Greg Whalley Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide  Watch for these events THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives  Nevertheless we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern and we believe we can improve refine streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone Therefore we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end ---	Effective immediately relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end  However business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10 and bottom 10 performers for review by Enrons Office of the Chairman annually at year-end ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year ---   Finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes In the November issue of Enron Business we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process  In addition there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale  Additionally some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns  Effective immediately we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources HR rep ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations ER that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman  Cindy Olson will head this function  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days Over the long term we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above as well as other current and emerging leaders to complete Executive Impact  Influence training  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people ---	Additionally we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate which will be rolled out immediately  Communicate is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video voice mails e-mails and meetings notes to analyze user performance based on a participants responses and actions EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees  We recognize that as Enrons ambassadors in the marketplace the more you know about our strategy performance and challenges the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company  To ensure you are better informed ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron  In addition to our existing communication efforts like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business we will post a QA on current issues on the Enron intranet at homeenroncom httphomeenroncom  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers --- As we said before Greg Mark and I as well as members of our Management Committee will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges  Look for these to start in mid-October INTEGRITY  RESPECT I believe as I said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect  From what you have told us in this survey you agree ---	Enrons values will have more importance in each employees evaluation and feedback  We ask that all employees regardless of level hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional specific feedback on employee issues like ethics integrity and individual concerns  If you would like to participate in these focus groups please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson ---   Periodically I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results Finally I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enrons strategy and challenges and listening to your concerns and ideas  But we would ask for your commitment too  We need your dedication to Enron and its values as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success  We will conduct another employee survey early next year  Please continue to send me your feedback and lets continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world

information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session The Assembly adjourned a few hours later closing the regular session but NOT the second extraordinary session The Legislatures options 1 The Governor calls them back in two weeks they continue with the second extraordinary session and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning 2 The Governor calls them back in two weeks the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session they begin a third extraordinary session and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch  However they can pass a waiver which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning 3 The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything ie the Govenor can call them back but he cant make them vote In short the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please Where to from here Through its actions on Saturday morning the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July Just before closing down on Saturday the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a sudden and severe energy shortage and that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17 2001 is at and end  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison  The Assembly did not pass the resolution however Given the Senates view and the open hositility between Davis and Burton Davis only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis Edison bill  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough With the Legislature gone the action turns to the PUC where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended or at a minimum to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive Finally Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said Burton and Senator Bowen Bowens been taking the lead on DA in the Senate will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses He doesnt know why the Governor would waste taxpayers money to hold a special session With all the troubled businesses in California right now he doesnt know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others If all this sounds ridiculous it is Well report back with additional information as we get it

ask firm to spell out how they will be repaid hundreds of millions of dollars for purchases under deregulation plan By NANCY VOGEL and JERRY HIRSCH TIMES STAFF WRITERS September 29 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Five big energy companies owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Southern California Edison pushed the utility a step closer to bankruptcy Friday by asking Edison to sign an agreement spelling out how each will be repaid The companies demanded that Edison meet with them within two weeks to work out a repayment plan and implied that otherwise they would drag the Rosemead-based utility into Bankruptcy Court Under federal law any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined 10775 The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars although the exact total is not known The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edisons fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors but has kept others waiting Some power generators in turn have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy although so far only Mirant Corp and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea And Gov Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy The letter sent by William Bates III a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with 1 billion in debt to big power sellers This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such says the letter to Edisons private attorney Thomas B Walper of Munger Tolles  Olson in Los Angeles We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has about an agreement to repay its debt the letter continues but we dont want to waste anybodys time Thus as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating    Please give us a simple yes or no answer to that question Of course we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement Bates wrote The five companies are Reliant Mirant Dynegy Corp Enron Corp and Puget Sound Energy which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state Edison officials refused to comment The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its 14-million debt to the city of Long Beach which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed 12 billion Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston which is owed 100 million to 200 million by Edison A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant which is also owed more than 100 million sounded a similar note It is time SCE made clear when how much and even if it is going to pay us Patrick Dorinson said So far other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edisons plight Davis who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edisons debt Other Creditors Take Notice Senate leader John Burton D-San Francisco has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utilitys 39-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCEs strategy of winning a legislative rescue From our perspective the days of luxury for Edison are over said John Moorlach Orange County treasurer The county holds 1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court By doing this the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first Moorlach said But Jay Lawrence spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE We still want to see a legislative solution and we are against bankruptcy Lawrence said Edison provides electricity to 11 million people It racked up the 39-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan The states deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers By January Edisons debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing So far the state has spent 107 billion on power purchases Edisons counterpart in Northern California Pacific Gas  Electric suffered the same financial squeeze in the states dysfunctional market PGE took itself into bankruptcy in April The generators demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on 200 million in loans until Oct 19 Shares of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison rose almost 5 Friday to close at 1316 on the New York Stock Exchange Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this report

Wednesday September 12 2001 118 AM To FriendsOfRory Subject Consider this In Memoriam for those who lost their lives in the tragic events of September 11 2001 Today Dress Wounds  Tomorrow Redress Grievances Revised by Michael Rectenwald httpwwwlegitgovorgsept11woundshtml At this time let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain in need in emergencies and in unfathomable grief  Let us focus in the immediate on the spirit the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to address with loving hearts minds and hands our physical moral and spiritual wounds which wounds are so deep and many tonight We are all suffering tonight but others suffer more than we do Let us help them Let us suspend our grievances for a brief time to focus on the well-being of our fellow human beings Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day and both have arguably contributed the day is ours and we must gather its bleeding members and wrap ourselves around them as bandages around lacerations Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today who had arms legs and parts of people falling on our heads Our nation is poorer our lives are lessened and our hearts are heavy tonight We who love democracy and value the lives of all people equally find ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally behind a leader who we know is not our leader a leader who has we believe already inflicted wounds on our nation a leader who has our nations fate in his hands and who has already endangered us Our anger towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --is justified We have warned and warned Bush is dangerous domestically and abroad Now under Bush we have experienced another unprecedented assault on our nation following the first one delivered on Jan 20 -- the worst act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation We do not think that this attack under Bushs command represents a meaningless coincidence Rather the events are linked part of that inescapable web of mutuality that Martin Luther King referred to There was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative consequences in and for the world The Bush political legacy from GH to GW on down has contributed greatly to the ire directed at our citizens That tensions in the Middle East have been exacerbated by the laissez faire policies of the unilateralist Bush that Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bushs non-stewardship the situation has approached anarchy not many in the movement and indeed the world doubt We must in very short order resume our assault on Bushs international policies of unilateralism bellicose posturing and treaty-breaking and soon before more casualties occur as a result But at the present moment and I mean in the very immediate moment let us address a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life liberty and the peaceable pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs Lets tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to those nearest us Therefore for the brief duration of our imperilment lets show some restraint with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose in our outrage at the ships captain and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism for example will not help either the nation or our movement it will hurt those in pain and alienate those who might otherwise concur with us However when delivered from this hopefully short excursus into Hell after reaching relatively safe harbor we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate captain   Our commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather it will take on a deeper significance  We will have purified ourselves to a degree and will then be more fit for direct action We will make sure our hearts are in the right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best interests of our nation at heart Let us then attend to our own and care for the nation displaying our own deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too much to contribute to bellicose international posturing and that also cares too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human beings The evils of today are more than enough for today Sincerely Michael Rectenwald Founder and Chair Citizens

directed by the man who heads the states energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter the president of the Independent System Operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge Winter defied his own board and Gov Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps records and interviews show I dont know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said Dunn The subpoenas will force those involved including Winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over e-mails personal calendars and memos Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of Winter The governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis Maviglio said Winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunns committee will find no criminal conduct The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on At the time generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps It was an emergency Fishman said We had to take action What became known as the palace coup began on Oct 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power The restrictions would drive prices as low as 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier They electricity generators grinned and beared the 750 price cap but this new plan by ISO was too much said Dunn whose committee has been investigating since March All hell broke loose Records show that on Oct 31 power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission demanding that the new plan be killed The letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators If not removed immediately the ISO price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws In the Oct 31 letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps werent removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market The generators got their way The next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan What was left in place was a 250 price cap established five months earlier Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldnt make a profit even under these constraints They began to withhold power from California and on Dec 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis Winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO submitted a 50-page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the 250 price cap Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government Neither the ISO board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of Winters actions until the cap had been removed In fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request Charles Robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made He didnt mention anything about it In retrospect we should have told them Robinson said With the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governors key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment Maviglio said It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant This action accelerated the utilities move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business Prices for electricity jumped from an average of 249 a megawatt to 700 a megawatt within three days ISO records show Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded 30 billion Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians Prices he said did not spike as a result Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern Robinson said In our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund Jan Smutney-Jones who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted Terry did this by himself said Smutney-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions Some board members pushed to have Winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governors spokesman Maviglio said James J Hoecker the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman defended making the December decision and also defended Winter They filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let California go dark Hoecker said They ISO management did what any independent system operator would do What Dunns committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winters Dec 8 actions should provide vital clues We dont know why he did what he did but we are eager to find out Dunn said Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians but I find that argument has no basis in fact

	Subject Re Dissent from Commissioners Bilas and Duque Opposing Suspension of DA 	I have a new description of PGEs reorg plan-- it is the ultimate 	expression of their longstanding affliction with Enron-envy Now that 	theyre cutting loose the UDCLDC they can fall flat on their faces with 	no safety net except the hydro of course   MIKE 	At 0443 PM 9242001 -0500 you wrote 	   Commissioners Henry M Duque and Richard A Bilas dissenting 	  	  One could say that this order is consistent with the Administrations 	  present third world country mentality We are punishing the very 	  consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric 	  restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the 	  dysfunctions in the wholesale market 	  	  We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources DWR bond 	  ratings depend on killing direct access  This notion is a scare 	  tactic and a smoke screen Direct access comprises such a small 	  percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a 	  threat to the sale of the bonds Direct Access should be seen as a 	  benefit to DWR  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net 	  short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing 	  responsibilities sooner 	  	  Something else is going on here We think that the DWR does not want 	  direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it 	  will make DWRs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear The Commission 	  should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR 	  Finance and the Treasurer  Instead the Commission is making an ill 	  informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions 	  later 	  	        DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if 	  DWR is making prudent energy purchases Only if DWRs contracts are 	  too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in 	  lower direct access prices Indeed retaining direct access as a way 	  to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place 	  pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases This is a very 	  important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any 	  prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in 	  order to repay the bonds If there is no yardstick how can anyone 	  measure DWR performance The answer is one cant unless SB 18xx is 	  signed into law 	  	        We think that additional review of these issues before 	  suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in 	  the long run 	  	  For these reasons we must respectfully dissent 	  	  	  	  	  s HENRY M DUQUE                              s RICHARD A BILAS 	          Henry M Duque 	  Richard A Bilas 	          Commissioner

a critical step before they could be marketed to investors Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the states energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers But the PUC said the administrations proposal might prove inadequate over time leading to future rate hikes The PUC also said the administrations plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue The PUC which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates did not want to cede that authority It rejected the Davis plan Oct 2 on a 4-1 vote led by its president Davis appointee Loretta Lynch Davis earlier said the commissions approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market The plan now under review however would bypass that The DWR would not directly set rates but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates Ive been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves then great Lynch said But to dedicate rates it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law a statutory set-aside It takes one of those two things The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislatures version of the payback plan By law the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx by Senate Leader John Burton D-San Francisco Davis opposes Burtons bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid followed by the energy suppliers The power companies contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute If Davis signs the order soon the bonds could go to market early next year Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected 4 billion to 6 billion shortfall in other income

California PUC Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commissions previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers The Legislature The Assembly version of the Senate MOU SB 78 has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 630 PM PDT today Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon based on negotiations between Davis office and business customers Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000 including those involuntarily returned to bundled service would be exempt from charges for Edisons undercollection DWRs forward contracts and DWR-related exit fees provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edisons remaining customers Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edisons undercollection DWRs forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edisons remaining customers Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17 2001

leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution rather than the date by which the

X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll A survey finds lingering damage from the governors handling of the energy crisis By Amy Chance Bee Political Editor Published Sept 26 2001 Gov Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him a Field Poll released Tuesday found The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 45 percent to 42 percent Riordans strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from Californias energy crisis were factors in the findings said the polls managing director Mark DiCamillo Its an interesting situation for a sitting governor he said Its very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about and thats the energy and the electricity crisis In a hypothetical Republican primary Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones 46 percent to 19 percent Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote while 30 percent was undecided The poll surveyed 1003 Californians including 722 registered voters Sept 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 32 percent Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was horribly misleading These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval he said These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general DiCamillo said he found it notable however that views of Davis performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis In May at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts voters said they disapproved of Davis performance 49 percent to 42 percent In the latest survey they continued to disapprove 47 percent to 41 percent Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis 50 percent to 43 percent Now were in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded yet the publics image of the governor has not changed DiCamillo said He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May No matter what the political temper of the times internationally there will be issues that are particular to the governors race This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis and its still negative DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County 47 percent to 43 percent He said the survey showed similar results in May Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the states electorate and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis Its clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most he said Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote theres no way he can get re-elected unless he turns LA County around in a very big way South said Riordan who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest And he recalled that then-Gov Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election We all know how that turned out he said A sitting California governor hasnt been defeated for a second term since 1942 The Bees Amy Chance can be reached

Pays Claims in Full Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State  Bailout San Francisco CA- PGE Corporation NYSE PCG and its utility unit Paci fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in US Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p roceedings The official creditors committee supports the plan This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi tioned to continue safe reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr icity to its customers pay all valid creditor claims in full and do so wi thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman CEO and Pr esident of PGE Corporation  And the plan will enable us to provide long -term growth prospects to shareholders 20 The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation  into two separate stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot her The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own  and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste m  The electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmi ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p art of PGE Corporation The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a nd Electric will be distributed to PGE Corporation shareholders The electric generation electric transmission and gas transmission operati ons when reorganized as new businesses under PGE Corporation will have t he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors claims The plan also re structures certain existing debt and uses 33 billion in cash on hand to s atisfy creditor claims20 Under the plan all valid creditor claims will be paid in full using a com bination of cash and long-term notes  In total the plan will provide cred itors with about 91 billion in cash and 41 billion in notes The vast m ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of 100000 or less-will rec eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec tive date of the plan  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen t of their allowed claims in cash  Finally unsecured creditors with allow ed claims in excess of the 100000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca sh and 40 percent in notes 09Following the restructuring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE  Corporation will be organized as follows20 09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i ts customers in Northern and Central California  It will hold 70 percent o f the current utility assets in terms of book value and will employ 1600 0 people  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans 20 09PGE Corporation in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus iness will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri c generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company20 The new electric generation business will be a California company establish ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a ssociated lands and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district s now held by the utility  In total the unit will have approximately 71 00 megawatts of generation  The facilities will be operated in accordance  with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and in ke eping with sound environmental stewardship policies  The generating busine ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com pany under a 12-year contract at a stable market-based rate20 The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u tility  The system comprises 18500 circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables The new gas transmission business will be a California company established  to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b y the utility including 6300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga s storage facilities 20 Following the reorganization the California Public Utilities Commission wi ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company i ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates  The Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses  for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of servic e provided by the electric transmission business  FERC will also assume ju risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear  Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service for the ga s transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline 20 Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reli able and long-term electric supply to California customers  It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce  And it enables us to keep our  generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga nization20 We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said  Glynn  We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t he people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for cu stomers and employees the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta te  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R esources The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately  be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented20 Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito rs said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r esolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness  It has our f ull support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte r 11 process20 With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Cha pter 11 process to completion reaffirming the financial health and creditw orthiness of our operations through this reorganization restoring customer s confidence and rebuilding value for our shareholders -

that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed or whether i f confirmed it will become effective some of the factors that could affec t the outcome materially include the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi ngs the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified legislative and r egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect ric and natural gas industries in the United States particularly in Califo rnia whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or  whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all risks re lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated  entities including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe d claims and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due  to among other reasons an adverse change in market conditions or in the c ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings  whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to pre-empt relevant n on-bankruptcy law and if so whether and the extent to which such assertion of

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No deal in energy refund talks20 By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau Published July 10 200120 WASHINGTON -- Negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of Cali fornias electricity debacle sputtered to an end Monday with the sides ligh t-years apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales20 The impasse raises the specter of years of litigation with a regulatory ju dge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about 1 billion while  California is seeking at least 89 billion and perhaps much more20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Curtis Wagner sai d that within a week hell urge the five FERC commissioners to begin fact-f inding hearings on how much is truly owed following guidelines he outlined sketchily Monday20 Among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed -- something that could reduce state claims by about one-third -- and changing the way  power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators 20 Gov Gray Davis said he was heartened by the judges belief that California is due some amount of refund money rejecting the generators arguments fo r no refunds20 With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund generators and power t raders had offered up 716 million in proposed refunds in the final days B ut Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state st ill owes power companies meaning no cash would actually change hands20 The judge held out the possibility that at least two parties including San Jose-based Calpine Corp could reach separate agreements with the state 20 From what I know it looks like we can reach an agreement Calpine spokes man Bill Highlander confirmed Monday But he said he could not disclose any details under Wagners gag order on participants in the negotiations20 Enron Corp one of the nations highest-profile power traders said Califo rnia officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the states consumers deserved at least 89 billion in refunds for overcharge s20 These talks never had a chance said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer Their  political skins are worth more than 716 million that the taxpayers of Cali fornia could have used It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a  witch hunt20 Of the 716 million compromise offer 510 million was put on the table by  what Wagner called the Big Five generators -- Reliant Duke Mirant Will iams and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation Another 125 million was offered by BC Hydro British Colombias government utility wh ich is not under FERC jurisdiction and 165 million was offered by six Ca lifornia municipal utilities20 The Sacramento Municipal Utility District the states second-largest munic ipal utility also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amoun t it may have offered but said it would outline its position in writing Th ursday the judges deadline for comments on his proposal20 Consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judges brief publi c remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on the states troubled electric scene20 If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion thats outra geous said Nettie Hoge head of The Utility Reform Network If theyre g oing to start doing some fact finding hallelujah20 Hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start because there was  no effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been a nd then work toward a compromise from there20 The state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator the Ind ependent System Operator which was attacked by marketers as wildly high ev en while the state called it conservatively low20 Joel Newton representing all five of the big generators said Monday that  the ISO has consistently based its demand on sketchy and incomplete data 20 The face-off between Davis and power merchants began last fall as wholesal e electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they  could be driven into bankruptcy20 The governor said generators and traders took advantage of the states powe r shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers Generators said they  followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situati on20 FERC which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electr icity rates are just and reasonable has made repeated unsuccessful effo rts to craft a solution that could appease both sides20 State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg D-Sherman Oaks said Monday that t he failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure comes as no surprise20 Negotiators representing generators refused to even acknowledge the inesca pable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional market -- at Californias expense he said20 Davis who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith with state representatives said that although FERC commissioners have bee n slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesa le electricity they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves20 He suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is rec ommended by the judge20 Wagner after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend seemed resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government utility and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futilit y20 Michael Kahn head of the California delegation and consultant to the Calif ornia ISO nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well 20 We came here wanting 89 billion Kahn said In all candor we didnt r eceive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped they would be But our positions were vindicated  because refunds were offered20 Meanwhile Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison soun ded the call for more talks20 Were willing to talk to anyone anytime about a settlement said Steve P ickett general counsel of Southern California Edison PGE said in a prepa red statement that the sessions provide a solid basis for further negotiat ions20 How much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question  mark Wagner said settlement offers of 716 million suggest that eventual r efunds will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion B ut he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC comm issioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be20 Other recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mi xed bag for the state20 The judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct 2 2000  an action that Kahn said would immediately slice 3 billion off the state s refund analysis that stretched back to May 200020 But Kahn said that was no defeat for the state which would turn to the cou rts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order 20 We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder Kahn said20 Brent Bailey vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy of North Am erica said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund  order in the range of 1 billion to 15 billion20 Its a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks Bailey said20 The Bees David Whitney can be reached at 202 383-0004 or dwhitneymcclat chydccom 20 Staff writers Emily Bazar and Dale Kasler contributed to this report Third power plant opens But the Los Medanos facility isnt pouring out ele ctricity yet20 By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published July 10 200120 The flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov Gray Davis was only a t rickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on Monday accord ing to sources close to Californias energy crisis20 Heralded by Davis as part of a powerful one-two-three punch that will bri ng California closer to energy independence the Los Medanos Energy Center  in Pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day they sa id20 That is less than 5 percent of the plants 555-megawatt operating capacity 20 Los Medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week bu t is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks accordin g to knowledgable sources20 Representatives for Calpine and the governors office when pressed for det ails acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said the y did not know how much electricity was actually produced Monday20 Calpine which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from Los Medanos is keeping track of the production but the figure wasnt immediat ely available for the media spokeswoman Katherine Potter said20 Even if it was two megawatts thats two more megawatts that we didnt hav e yesterday said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio20 He said the opening was largely ceremonial timed for the convenience of  the governor and Calpines top executive20 But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the media event a deception  It was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has a ttended in the past two weeks20 Its the governor trying to convince people hes hard at work solving the  problem when its all for show Rosenfield said Hes governing by sound  bite Hes certainly getting his moneys worth from the consultants he hire d20 Davis political adviser Garry South said last week that the governors new  radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in Calif ornia20 Generation comes up in our polls as being the No 1 thing people want us t o do -- build more power plants South said then People want the sense t hat progress is being made -- that this is not spiraling out of control 20 The other two plants that Davis kicked off -- Sunrise in Kern County and Su tter near Yuba City -- have since been running at maximum capacity20 Calpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of Los Medanos withi n a week to 10 days company officials said20 In the first month of these new plants there are always stops and starts  said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander Sometimes we shut down altogethe r20 Including the three just-opened facilities new or expanded power plants ar e expected to add 1500 megawatts to the states struggling electric grid b y the end of July and 870 megawatts of that is already in place according to the state Independent System Operator20 Another 1000 megawatts is anticipated for the end of August and 1100 more for the end of September under a rough timetable that is likely to see so me plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind20 The

Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity o n the spot market revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wild ly within minutes20 The Department of Water Resources which has been criticized for keeping it s power-purchasing practices a secret released 1770 pages of invoices and trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purcha ses since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan 17 The informatio n was released a week after state Controller Kathleen Connell put out detai ls of the states long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov Gra y Davis her political nemesis20 The state has committed about 81 billion to buying power on behalf of Cal ifornias crippled utilities straining the budget surplus and raising ques tions

dollars20 When it came to the spot market the water department was at the mercy of a business run amok The state paid upward of 300 a megawatt-hour for days  in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot cheaper Water officials said prices have dropped to the 100 range largel y because theyve signed a slew of long-term contracts reducing their depe ndence on spot

Duke Energy Corp of North Car olina charged even more for power in January 3880 a megawatt hour but t hat sale was made to the Independent System Operator which runs the state s transmission grid20 The documents show that while the states stricken utilities no longer buy  power for themselves their sister companies have sold expensive power20 Through May 31 the state paid a trading arm of Sempra

energy wasnt s o scarce20 Split-second timing was also crucial At 909 am Feb 14 the state paid  400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day By 10 am it was pa ying Mieco Inc a Long Beach

conserve The Santa Rita Jail goes solar as agenci es get creative to cut costs By Cheryl Miller Bee Correspondent Published July 10 200120 To Matt Muniz the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa Rita  Jail in Dublin arent just energy-makers theyre money in the bank20 When all 4000 panels are completely installed this month the 500-kilowatt photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the United States -- will cut the jails demand on the electric grid by up to  20 percent according to Muniz Alameda Countys energy program manager20 That sun power combined with conservation projects already completed at th e jail will slash about 300000 a year from the facilitys energy bill M uniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential20 With the cost of electricity going up you can start looking at it as a bu siness decision just investing your money said Muniz Theres virtually no maintenance on this equipment It just sits on your roof and converts r ight into electricity that youre using as soon as you generate it I think solar is the wave of the future even though its been around 30 or 40 y ears20 The Santa Rita Jail project is among the largest and perhaps most conspicu ous examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity us e in response to skyrocketing power bills and Gov Gray Davis call for pub lic entities to conserve20 Among the examples20 San Francisco leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar-powered rooftop projects around the city20 The Tulare County town of Lindsay will open City Hall two hours earlier --  at 6 am-- and close at 430 pm Monday through Thursday this summer so o ffices can stay dark all day Friday and during peak-use afternoon hours20 Sacramento County has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can bet ter withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees Workers have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps oper ate during low demand20 When you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns fr om some citizens that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help ou t said Jolena Voorhis an energy analyst at the California State Associat ion of Counties Certainly counties stepped up to the plate when they we re asked to increase conservation efforts Theyve done about as much as hu manly possible20 Kings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signe d up for Southern California Edisons interruptible load program which pro mises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrica l services in times of shortage20 Then Californias power crisis hit full-force this year Since January Edi son has called on the Central Valley county to cut electricity at its Hanfo rd government center 16 times -- for up to six hours each cycle20 At times that meant no lights to greet the public no computers to process  food stamp requests and during the Valleys foggy winter days no heat to w arm many of the 1200 employees20 We had one week in January when we were virtually shut down said Chief A dministrative Officer Larry Spikes We just decided we couldnt function t hat way20 So Kings County supervisors bought a 550000 diesel-powered generator to m atch those already at the jail and juvenile center They also decided to op en and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildin gs can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 pm20 The new hours dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the  generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business  these days Spikes said20 So far most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without  cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years  Voorhis said20 Public agencies power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses20 Revenues at PowerLight the Berkeley company that installed the Santa Rita  Jail photovoltaic system have tripled since last year20 The last six months have been particularly intense said Janice Lin dire ctor of business development for PowerLight In some ways the energy crisi s in California has been a call to action20 The Sacramento Municipal Utility District which already boasts the largest photovoltaic program in the country has a 2000-customer waiting list for solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state Capitol said Don Osborn SMUDs solar program manager20 Back in Dublin the 3600 inmates at the Santa Rita Jail still receive thre e meals air conditioning and hot showers -- powered now in part by the p lentiful sun in this relatively fog-free part of the East Bay20 The 4 million project financed entirely with state and utility subsidies should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade Muniz  said20 Its a good investment for the money were putting up front he said Energy talks reach no settlement state threatens suit        By Mark Sh erman ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the  state and power generators stalled California may go to court to help win  the 89 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity   I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the j udge that the state is owed 89 billion and will settle for nothing less said Roger Salazar a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis  With negotiations at an impasse the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed no more than 1 billion in ref unds    The numbers were too far apart said Curtis Wagner the FERC chi ef administrative law judge  California Wagner said may receive nothing  at all because generators may be owed more than they have to return for an y overcharges  He placed the refunds owed the state at between 716 millio n and 1 billion Power providers had offered 716 million as part of an ov erall settlement while California state officials sought 89 billion Wag ner said  He said California officials had not made the case for 89 bill ion in refunds  Salazar however said the state would go to court and may ask for 20 billion  Separately Wagner split off claims of overcharges f rom the Pacific Northwest saying he has not had time to consider those all egations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month  Wagner serv ed as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a se ttlement to FERC by next Monday The commission ordered the talks last mont h in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over  the breakdown of Californias deregulated electricity market  Consumer adv ocates assailed the judges recommendation and urged the state to continue  its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power compan ies  Its like catching a bank robber but instead of making him give bac k all of it you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole said  Douglas Heller spokesman for the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpaye r and Consumer Rights  Power generators however were generally pleased w ith Wagners comments  Brent Bailey general counsel for Duke Energy said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces 15 billion in refunds t hats a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks  Calif ornia officials negotiating on behalf of utilities the Public Utilities C ommission and state power buyers accused the producers of manipulating sup ply to unfairly drive up prices  The producers have acknowledged prices ar e high but blame jumps in the price of natural gas which fuels many power plants and the workings of the free market  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to 27 billion last year from 7 billion the year bef ore Davis has estimated the state could spend as much as 50 billion this  year  The producers reiterated Monday that Californias numbers are grossl y inflated Attorneys for the five major generators - Duke Energy Dynegy  Mirant Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos - said in a statement that the y have made a very substantial global settlement offer  Reliant would ag ree to no more than 50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims s aid John H Stout a company senior vice president  But Stout also said  Reliants fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are jus tified              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees p ossibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert  COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collap sed yesterday and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal reg ulators set a course far from favorable to the states demand for 89 bill ion in refunds  There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of  dollars and maybe a billion dollars Curtis L Wagner Jr chief administr ative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in previ ewing the recommendations he will make to the commission  But Wagner who  mediated the talks also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f or electricity that probably are higher than any overcharges for which th ey may have to pay refunds  That opened the possibility that California co uld see no cash refunds only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po wer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util ities  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a fast-track hearing  to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from Californias power crisis  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai d FERC should use for calculating refunds  While his proposed formula incl udes part of one method the state used it contains several elements for ca lculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers who maintai n that Californias numbers are wildly exaggerated  I would suspect that  would result in a number much below 89 billion said Joe Ronan vice pre sident of Calpine a San Jose-based electricity generator I think Wagner s method reflects more accurately what actually happened in the states  dysfunctional power market  But Michael Kahn the states lead negotiator said Wagner vindicated Californias core arguments  The hundreds of pe ople who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there  should not be any refunds and that position was loudly rejected said Kah n chairman of the organization that manages most of Californias power gri d  We think the numbers even using the judges formula are going to be  in the multiple billions Whatever amount of money    is awarded to us  we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the r emainder So what we have here is a situation where California will get its 89 billion  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation r emains worrisome to them They sought an end to investigations of their con duct and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position  During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC the two sides came nowhe re near bridging their differences Wagner said a number of power sellers h ad put forward offers that totaled 7161 million  Thats a long way from splitting the difference he said In 15 days you cant work miracles Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will betwee n the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the pr eviously closed hearings  Each side essentially accused the other of barga ining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals  John H Stout a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group said the state used biased calculations to arrive at its 89 billion refund dema nd He also said that Reliant offered to knock 50 million off the 300 mil lion it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state  Kahn shot b ack that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approach ed the state  Figures scrutinized This is the first time weve heard any  of this information And to give the impression that somehow theres been c ooperation or forthcomingness I think is misleading Kahn said  The stat es refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks  The  89 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera tor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001 a period when wholesale power prices soared  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli cated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b een if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo r the entire yearlong period  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to  tame wholesale prices in the West  In a partial win for the state Wagner  said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis fo r calculating refunds an approach resisted by the power sellers  But he s aid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000 an d should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula ted  For instance he said FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr ices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas rath er than a statewide average cost computed monthly  Fewer overcharges Tho se and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre ase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over charges  Kahn said that applying FERCs pricing method only back to Octobe r would put about 3 billion of the states refund claim off-limits  Brent Bailey vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North America  said We think Wagners modifications are certainly a vast improvement o ver FERCs June 19 order and also certainly over the states model  Ame rica  In Sacramento Gov Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith   While in the past the FERC has shown little if any interest in consumers  they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the 89  billion California has demonstrated it is owed Davis said  Despite the h arsh rhetoric both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reac h one-on-one settlements  Ronan of Calpine said the generator was close to making a deal with the state Bailey said that while Duke would continue t o push for a global settlement between all the parties Weve had seriou s settlement talks with the state over the last few days and hope to contin ue

CH CONNELL and ROBERT J LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10  2001  SACRAMENTO -- Californias energy meltdown involves a far more divers e group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov Gray Davi s who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies state records  show  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretch es of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and privat e entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms according to documents released to The Times on Monday by  the Department of Water Resources which now buys power for California  Am ong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per meg awatt-hour were a Canadian public utility a subsidiary of San Diego Gas   Electrics parent company and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe r the report shows Their average prices ranged from 498 a megawatt-hour  charged by Powerex the trading arm of British Columbias BC Hydro to 292 an hour by the DWP In fact some of the biggest private power companies s ingled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc D uke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid  for the period Those companies average prices ranged from 146 to 240 pe r megawatt-hour according to an analysis of the documents  The figures co ver the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state  during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month o f razor-thin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies  Davis spok esman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at p rivate out-of-state generators because in general they have reaped the hi ghest profits over the longest period  You have to look at the whole pict ure Maviglio said  The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said Their profits were 100 to 400 above last year    Just because there are other enti ties who are charging us more per megawatt-hour doesnt change the fact t hat we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston Tulsa Atlanta or  Charlotte  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided t o The Times on the same day the state released 1700 pages of documents on  Californias electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year s first quarter  The records detail how the state spent nearly 8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the comp lexity of the states energy problem They also show that patterns of high  prices are not limited to a few generators  Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that price s were extremely volatile early in the year All the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying pow er in mid-January  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purch ases went from 316 in January to 243 in May Spot prices fell from an ave rage of 321 per hour to 271 the reports show  In the first quarter of t he year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest pri vate companies For example Houston-based Enron one of the nations bigge st power traders charged an average of 181 per megawatt-hour And Atlanta -based Mirant which sold the most to the state a total of 706 million c harged an average of 225 per megawatt-hour  By contrast a Calgary Canad a firm TransAlta Energy averaged 335 a megawatt-hour and the Sacrament o Municipal Utility District had average charges of 330 per megawatt-hour A spokesman for Enron Mark Palmer said recently that the vilification  of Enron was based on politics not facts Spokesmen for BC Hydro could no t be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state In the  past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep Californias lights on   A spokeswoman for Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas  Electric s aid late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state Officials at DWP who could not be reac hed Monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of produc ing the power needed by the state were extremely high  More Power Bought T han Projected  Hidalgo of the Department of Water Resources said his agen cys efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falli ng natural gas prices have begun to tame the states market  Still the s tate had to purchase 321 million in power in April and May about 10 more than Davis analysts had projected  Hidlago said that was because of hot  weather in May and other supply problems in April He said reports will sho w that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early Ju ly  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in  June and July partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to wel l under 100 a megawatt-hour  A summary Department of Water

ordered those gyratio ns to keep the power flowing throughout the state Dunn said Dukes refusal thwarts the committees investigation and efforts to enact possible remedi al legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with o thers in the Legislature or the public  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority  to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret  The only o ne who can release the data is Duke We agreed to be bound by what is provi ded in the FERC tariff nothing more or less he said  Former Employees T ell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to ob tain the information elsewhere and release it over Dukes objections  Th ree former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month  under oath that the plant among other things was ramped up and down in wh at seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan 16-18 emergen cy  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the California Independent System Operator which keeps the states electricit y grid in balance Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its exp lanation  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to pro vide a full picture of the plants operation during the three days  But Du nn chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging said  Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data Du ke was guilty of the same tactics  Duke is trying to draw the impression  that it has provided the full picture But they are fully aware that we c annot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released Tha t hasnt occurred Dunn said  To make a determination whether the Chula V ista power was withheld to drive up prices Dunn said the committee must p ublicly examine the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders t o the plant They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets  he said  Duke a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several pla nts in California noted that it considers the information proprietary and  off-limits to legislators not on the committee  Duke spokesman Tom William s insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committees  demands But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidd ing documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn o ver  We are complying now Williams said There is some suggestion that we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify    I dont know what we are ultimately going to do  The committee had threate ned to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidd ing documents by Wednesday Six including Duke have said they would compl y to avoid a contempt citation Two Enron and Mirant were cited  Dunn sa id the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to comply an extra week to do so but others probably will be formally charge d with contempt in a report to the full Senate The upper house is the fina l arbiter of such issues  Although there is scant precedent for levying pe nalties against those cited for contempt Dunn said he favors imposing seve re fines In 1929 the most recent case a cement company executive was sen t to jail  Copyright

r escue Edison DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve n as the summer progresses without blackouts and Gov Gray Davis prepares  for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power plant the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting  task of balancing the books  Its a task with potentially far more long-la sting implications for state coffers for businesses bottom lines and for  consumers wallets  In particular long-term power contracts trumpeted by  the governors office as helping to bring stability to Californias out-of-control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically A gr owing concern about the 43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat ing one of Davis most ambitious energy initiatives a proposed financial r escue of Southern California Edison which already faces an uncertain fate  in the Legislature Questions about the contracts come as California readie s a complex 134-billion bond sale to reimburse the states general fund f or other power purchases  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac ts on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue could lead  to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers Key lawmakers consumer advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact s be renegotiated  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs these critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the prices They argue that the state entered into the d eals under duress after Californias utilities neared insolvency and the st ate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f or more than 25 million residents  They are vulnerable Senate Energy Co mmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey said of deals the state s truck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs  B owen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing the best deals the y could But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati ons took place the state had two cards and the generators had 50  Contr acts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or mor e immediately before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto n There an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework ed as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar ged the state for electricity by 89 billion  We ought not to say Fine  the contracts were the best we could do  Bowen said  For his part Da vis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the 89 billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state He attributes th e recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation the ad ministrations effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon g-term contracts which slashed the states reliance on the volatile daily or spot market  You can see the value of these long-term contracts     dramatically shrinking our overall price which is what matters to Califo rnians Davis said pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30  from May to June  Davis energy advisor S David Freeman who helped nego tiate the contracts said they may end up costing less than 43 billion gi ven the recent decline in prices for natural gas the main fuel for Califor nias electricity-generating plants  Freeman also compared critics to some one who calls the fire department to douse a blaze After the fire is out  he said you complain about the water damage  The contracts have other defenders among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein  who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene rators incentive to drive up prices while reducing the states exposure t o wild swings in price  The point of signing long-term contracts is not t o get a great price its to reduce risk Borenstein said  Still experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S an Diego ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz ations and Republican lawmakers ordered last month that Davis unseal the c ontracts  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep resenting Southern California Edison the Utility Reform Network a consume r group and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about 43-bill ion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c osts When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip ment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an  additional 10 to 20  Once the contracts were made public Senate Repub lican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said just about anyone who ca n read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated  As buyers r emorse spreads through the Capitol the contracts increasingly are seen as  a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa ching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing  into a broader financial crisis  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc y for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b y Aug 15 The deadline could be tighter because the Legislature is schedu led to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20  Davis rescue plan along wi th legislative alternatives languishes in the Legislature The plan which has little apparent support would require the state to buy Edisons syste m of transmission lines for 276 billion and permit the utility to charge  ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of 35 billion  Some lobbyists a nd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th e California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la rgest in state history--may not be enough The revenue generated under the  new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an d repay the planned 134 billion in bonds which would be the largest muni cipal deal ever  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t he Edison rescue remains to be seen But some experts say the utility may n eed to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs  As written the contr acts have few escape clauses Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he concludes that prices are too high Still criticism persists and crosses  political lines  Harry Snyder longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers  Union and Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Tech nology Assn rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate But in s eparate interviews they sounded similar themes  If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts even if we have to pay damages wed be be tter off in the long run Snyder said  Stewart like other business leade rs does not advocate abrogating the contracts But like many familiar with the terms he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated  They are proble matic he said  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit y prices for the next decade the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t o agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power  State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the 13 4-billion bond sale A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i nvestors can be assured that they will be repaid  The state will be out o f cash by the end of the year without the bond sale he said We will mov e toward fiscal insolvency  The so-called rate agreement a draft of whic h was obtained by The Times would bind customers of the three big regulate d utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the 134 b illion in bonds Consumers would have to pay for consultants lawyers to p ay taxes fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t he Department of Water Resources  Additionally the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm all customers to cut electricity use although the Legislature has not appr oved the programs and their details remain to be worked out The Department of Water Resources estimates the cost to be 800 million spread over this year and next  It is loaded up Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D -San Francisco said of the proposed rate deal adding that it would requir e the commission to raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water  Resources decides to do  That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat ic office he said  Dictatorial Power Warning  Stewart of the manufactu rers group also is alarmed by the plan saying it would provide the water a gency with dictatorial power  As skeptical as we are of the PUC process  at least there is a process Stewart said referring to the commissions procedures to set electricity rates There is no process for DWR DWR jus t tells the PUC This is what we need and the PUC must approve it  Oth ers say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work given the extraordi nary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in to debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers  In essence Davis energy advisor Freeman said lawmakers in January create d the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency beyond the jurisdict ion of the PUC  There is no public power agency in California that is rev iewed by the PUC said Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power    Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angel es contributed to this story  Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times        Sta tes refund demand rejected  Judge ends rebate talks rebukes 9

Washington -- An adm inistrative law judge delivering a powerful message to Gov Gray Davis and California energy officials cast aside the states claim that it is owed  89 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for furthe r hearings to determine hard numbers  The judge ending talks designed t o settle the dispute between California and power sellers said the state a nd its cash-strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills tha n they are owed for overcharges by the generators  The comments by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis L Wagn er although a strong endorsement of the generators position seemed to in dicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the f ive-member regulatory commission  There are refunds due to California t hat total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars Wag ner said yesterday  At the same time there are sums due to sellers from  the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t hat the state may come up with  Now it will be up to the federal regul ators to settle the case But the recommendations by Wagner who mediated t he talks carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th e states chances of collecting the full 89 billion it claims to be owed The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t o calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed The hearing s would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60  days Wagner said  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing session of the 15-day talks which were ordered last month by the regulato ry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca lifornia officials before it reached the courts  The judges message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D avis who last week said he wouldnt take a dime less than 89 billion for Californias consumers  The governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s tate is owed refunds  I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo logy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators position that no  refunds are due Davis said  The governors chief representative at the t alks Michael Kahn called the judges statement a ringing endorsement of the states call for refunds Kahn said the judges order would improve th e states legal position if it files suit against power sellers  GENERATOR S FAVORED But much of the judges order seemed to favor the generators  Fo r example state officials have made the case they should be refunded 8 9 billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t he regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct 2 200 0 could be considered  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t he October date meaning that more than a third of the states claim -- at  least 3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission  Brent Bailey vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America said that under Wagners guidelines the state may be eligible for 1 billion to 1 5 billion  Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California  has been saying its a victory Bailey said of the judges statement  Bu t Davis said the nations big power sellers never came to the table with a  serious offer  Not surprisingly the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer s out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f aith Davis said  716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to California 716 million in refunds  The  judge said the figure included about 510 million from the so-called Big Fi ve generators as well as 125 million from BC Hydros Powerex 496 milli on by a group of 15 electricity marketers 165 million by six California  municipal utilities and 25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel lers  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in cluded no cash It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the states debt off the books  Throughout the talks generators complain ed that the California team was trying to shield some California companies  and government power providers from having to pay any refunds and trying t o disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies  FAVOR ITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews the state attempted to remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co Southern California Edison San Diego Gas  Electric the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g overnment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun ds even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el se  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad e a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom ise on the states claims They say the governor calculated that his reputa tion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators  The Califo rnia delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compr omise said Mark Stultz vice president of the Electric Power Supply Assoc iation a Washington DC trade group They went in with a dollar figure and never budged on that figure If youre looking for a settlement you h ave to be willing to compromise  Up next 1 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will consider probably on July 25  new hearings on how much  if anything California was overcharged 2 If ordered by the commission a n administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says i t was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed 3 Regulators  will rule based on the judges recommendation If the parties disagree the y can go to court  E-mail the writers at zcoilesfchroniclecom  and cber thelsensfchroniclecom  Zachary Coile reported from Washington DC an d

on support columns as Gov Gray Davi s celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help California build its way out of the energy crisis The state rushed to throw as many megawatts on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular b lackouts and yesterday the governor said it was paying off  This is the  third plant Ive helped open in the last 13 days Davis said pumping his  fist as the Calpine Corp plant belched an impressive burst of steam In t he past 13 days weve put more power on the grid than California did throu ghout the 1990s  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutte r Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of 1115 megawatts online Last month Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfiel d plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule  Davis used yester days event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged  the state for electricity Yet he lauded San Jose-based Calpine as a sort o f energy favorite son  They were the first to enter long-term contracts w ith us the governor said Calpine is among the big energy firms being pre ssed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overc harges but unlike the others Davis said Calpine is giving ground in nego tiations  They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us  he said  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of effic ient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to ru n than their forebears the state will be paying well above current market  rates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine  Calpine Pre sident Peter Cartwright insisted however that the company is not making e xcess profits off the deal To ensure that Calpine could provide the electr icity even if plant construction wasnt finished by its mid-July target dat e the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at 232 a  megawatt hour when market rates were higher he said  In addition to the 3 00 megawatts it has pledged to the state Calpine will supply electricity t o the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies  In t he long term Calpine will be selling power to California at 59 a megawatt hour Cartwright said  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Reso urces which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled  under high prices said Calpines rate is well below the 70 a megawatt hou r the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts  Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants along with an 875- m egawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May the company is doi ng its share to ease the states supply crunch  Ours are the lowest contr acts in the state he said If these plants werent online wed be havin g blackouts  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power g rid said California is skating so close to blackouts that every megawatt c ounts  Its definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so over the summer said Lorie ODonley a

other western states  The talks i nitiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates cross -border power sales in the United States concluded Monday evening without  resolution  Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Odowichuk said that under the offer  the Crown corporation would have been subtracted 125 million from the 290 million California still owes British Columbia for power sales

the power cris is but financial information released yesterday shows the lions share of  the money went elsewhere  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered le ss than 10 percent of Californias multibillion-dollar energy purchases wh ile public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to Californi a got the rest  The 424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies both in and out of Texas  Earlier this year Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state Whats going on here pure  and simple is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers --  most of them incidentally located in Texas he said in May  Yesterday  a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who hav e also gouged California  Anywhere they wear cowboy hats they probably h ave handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind sai d Steve Maviglio Davis spokesman  The latest financial information is co ntained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing 7 2 billion in power purchases from Jan 17 through the end of May  About  52 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made  a day hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used  Because the spot purchases are made with little notice they are the most  expensive kind of power on the market The state was forced to step in and  buy the power when the credit ratings of Californias major utilities dropp ed as the energy crisis worsened The crisis was caused by a series of even ts that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could re cover from customers  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas compa nies werent alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie Some 12 billion went to Mirant an Atlanta-based company Mirant has refused to tu rn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its invest igation into

WASHINGTON AP  --  With talks between the state and power generators stalled California may go to court to help win the 89 billion state officials believe it wa s overcharged for electricity  I think we have demonstrated very clearly  both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed 89 billion and w ill settle for nothing less said Roger Salazar a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis  With negotiations at an impasse the administrative law judge for  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed n o more than 1 billion in refunds  The numbers were too far apart said  Curtis Wagner the FERC chief administrative law judge  California Wagner said may receive nothing at all because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges  He placed the refunds owed the s tate at between 716 million and 1 billion Power providers had offered 7 16 million as part of an overall settlement while California state officia ls sought 89 billion Wagner said  He said California officials had not  made the case for 89 billion in refunds  Salazar however said the stat e would go to court and may ask for 20 billion  Separately Wagner split  off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FE RC last month  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiati ons and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday The commission  ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between pr oducers and the state over the breakdown of Californias deregulated electr icity market  Consumer advocates assailed the judges recommendation and u rged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say ar e profiteering power companies  Its like catching a bank robber but ins tead of making him give back all of it you only make him give back 5 perce nt of what he stole said Douglas Heller spokesman for the Santa Monica-b ased Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights  Power generators howeve r were generally pleased with Wagners comments  Brent Bailey general co unsel for Duke Energy said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces  15 billion in refunds thats a reasonable amount in the context of thes e settlement talks  California officials negotiating on behalf of utilit ies the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers accused the pr oducers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices  The producers  have acknowledged prices are high but blame jumps in the price of natural  gas which fuels many power plants and the workings of the free market  T he bill for wholesale power in California soared to 27 billion last year f rom 7 billion the year before Davis has estimated the state could spend a s much as 50 billion this year  The producers reiterated Monday that Cali fornias numbers are grossly inflated Attorneys for the five major generat ors -- Duke Energy Dynegy Mirant Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos --said in a statement that they have made a very substantial global settlem ent offer  Reliant would agree to no more than 50 million in refunds as  part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection fr om additional legal claims said John H Stout a company senior vice presi dent  But Stout also said Reliants fundamental

Chemical Corp plant When the plant powered back u p a cloud of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released  Contra Cost a hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a pos sibility that a plants hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming o nline and the states successful conservation effort  He also said industr y has done a good job preparing for outages  The industry is doing a good -faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens  Pascalli said  County officials relied on industry records in determini ng the adequacy of the different plans such as having multiple electrical  leads feeding a source regulating hazardous materials  Denny Larson spoke sman for the group Communities for a Better Environment said the report re lied too heavily on industry self-reporting  Unfortunately the conclusio ns of the report cant be backed up by the facts Larson said Oil and ch emical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to pow er failures over the years  The 52 facilities include chemical plants oi l refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous mate rials  For many of these businesses the loss of power would shut down the ir operations and make it impossible for substances to be released  Larger facilities like oil refineries have either their own backup generators o r contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply all or most of their power independent of the electricity power grid according to the report  Plans are also in place to conduct partial shutdowns at plants running on  reserve power during a blackout  General Chemical said all electrical feed s to the chamber processing chemicals are automatically pulled in the event of loss of power A backup generator will automatically come online to kee p operations stable  Dow Chemical has a contract with a Calpine

BY JIM PUZZANGHERA   Mercury News Washington Bureau  WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree o n refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiation s ended Monday leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said the state is owed much less than the 89 billion it demands  The judge o verseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re funds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars His estimate is closer to the 7161 million offer made by power suppliers dur ing negotiations The offer was rejected by California officials  But it w as unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail and California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court At stake is how much the states electricity consumers will ultimately have t o pay for costs that skyrocketed as Californias deregulation system collap sed  Curtis Wagner the commissions chief administrative law judge will  recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating  back to October That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor s such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e nergy suppliers had advocated during the talks  Michael Kahn who headed t he California negotiating team said the state would contest some aspects o f the formula But even without changes Kahn said he was confident the for mula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated  We think the num bers even using the judges formula are going to be in the multiple billion s said Kahn chairman of the state Independent System Operator which ru ns the electricity grid California will get its 89 billion dollars If we dont get all of it from the commission    well still get the remai nder of the money through the courts  Amount in dispute  Power industry  representatives appeared pleased with the judges plan  We havent gone  and run the full numbers but its going to be nowhere near the 89 billion  said Brent Bailey vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy  North America But lets face it thats a pie-in-the-sky number that nob ody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number  Wagne r acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula saying  he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers   The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon th when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity prices in California and throughout the West Commissioners hoped that und er pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the  power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat ion  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal par ticipants said  The numbers were too far apart You saw 89 billion on  one end and you saw 716 million on the other end and thats a long way to splitting the difference Wagner said I think a lot of the parties ge nuinely wanted to settle Others didnt  Wagner now has until Monday to  make his recommendation to the five-member commission which will make the  final ruling on refunds To date the commission has ordered 125 million i n refunds for periods since last Oct 2  Wagner said Monday that he will a sk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun d total using his formula  The state may not end up with any cash as any  refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers  Reflecting the tone  of the negotiations California Gov Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp liers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve the situation  Not surprisingly the energy pirates that bilked ratepay ers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team in Washington DC Davis said While in the past the FERC has shown little if any interest in consumers they now have th e opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the 89 billion California has demonstrated it is owed  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday Davis told reporters tha t hes prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesnt order the full refund Davis also said the ISOs estimate of 89 billion doesn t represent all the overcharges He said other estimates put the figure as  high as 20 billion although he did not elaborate about how those figures  were calculated  John H Stout senior vice president for Reliant Energy W holesale Group said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the 8 9 billion figure  California officials and several suppliers said they wou ld continue to negotiate separately and an official with San Jose-based Ca lpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state  Power supp liers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi ons June price-limits plan retroactively But thats what Wagner said he w ill do It was a victory for California officials who had pushed for it W agner however also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s uppliers had wanted He applied it only back to Oct 2 2000 State officia ls wanted it to cover up to May 2000  3 billion difference  The states  89 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001 Factoring refunds  beginning with Oct 2 2000 eliminates about 3 billion in overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period  Among the changes to the commi ssions formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect ricity price limit is calculated Wagner wants the price limit determined f or each hour of each day The commissions formula sets a price limit durin g Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen cy  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is Stanford University ec onomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w ill produce a much higher figure than 1 billion  Thats the methodology the state used said Wolak who advises the California ISO on market iss ues By using the marginal unit for each hour youll get refund numbers  on the order of what the state estimated    Mercury News Staff Writers B randon Bailey and Dana Hull contributed to this

BY MARK GLADSTONE NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSE NBAUM   Mercury News Sacramento Bureau    SACRAMENTO -- Six months after ju mping into the electricity business the Davis administration on Monday pro vided the first detailed glimpse of Californias daily power purchases sho wing more than 5 billion in payments much of it to government-owned utili ties and private companies that state officials have branded as price gouge rs  The state spent an additional 25 billion on a variety of contracts a nd other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy mar kets according to documents that the state agreed to release last week ami d a legal dispute over public access to the data  In roughly the first fiv e months of the year the state shelled out 12 billion to Atlanta-based M irant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by 1 billio n to Powerex the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia It also pa id 331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power  The docu ments raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis For instance almost 40 percent of the stat es purchases have come from government-run power generators in California  and elsewhere but not Texas some of the biggest suppliers are from the No rthwest  Gov Gray Davis who has ambitions to run for the White House ha s put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies  based in President Bushs home state  The figures are tucked inside 1770  of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging saying disclosure w ould encourage suppliers to charge more The state which last month releas ed information on its long-term electricity contracts worth 43 billion ag reed Thursday to release the first quarter details  Short on explanation   The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate r Resources which buys power for the states financially strapped major ut ilities and seem to buttress the administrations contention that the pric e of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for wha t prompted the decrease  In January for instance the average price for p ower on the spot market was 321 a megawatt hour It peaked in April at 33 2 and dropped to 271 in May  One megawatt powers about 750 homes  Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governors assert ions that California has been gouged The bad guys are clearly the out-of -state generators Maviglio said There has been a significant shift of money out of California  But the documents fail to shed much light on w hether as the administration contends the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year Critics contend that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t he state to pay high prices for many years  Used for support  Republican o fficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis a Democrat for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as  the price of power on the spot market was coming down partly because of th e declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants  Its more cle ar than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal said Assemblyma n Tony Strickland R-Camarillo The governors really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years  The newly released bills highlight the v olatility of Californias energy market where the price per megawatt hour  ranged from 70 to 1000 On any given day the records show the prices f rom seller to seller varied widely with some of the highest prices being c harged by public utilities and companies outside Texas  On one day in Febr uary for example San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging 165 per mega watt hour the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly 500 and Duke Energy a North Carolina company was charging up to 575  The state s daily spending peaked May 10 at 1024 million for all power including  the spot market and contracted power  The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the states major utilities which were unable to borr ow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity  San J ose-based Calpine Corp which is building several new power plants around  California including one in South San Jose did only 29 million worth of b usiness with the state in the first five months of the year according to t he figures  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas  Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co were on the ropes financia lly PGE later went into bankruptcy  On Monday state lawmakers took anot her shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing E dison  While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison  will not win the necessary support in the Legislature lawmakers have creat ed several working groups to come up with alternatives  Compromise plan  O n Monday state Sen Byron Sher D-Redwood City unveiled the latest compro mise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the E dison bailout  The shared pain proposal would force power producers o wed about 1 billion to take a 30 percent haircut and agree to forgive about 300 million in Edison debts Edison would be asked to swallow 12  billion -- about a third of its debt And big users would be asked to pay o ff the remaining 2 billion in debts possibly by paying higher prices for  power  In exchange large companies would be given the opportunity to buy  power on the open market a system that would allow many of them to sign ch eap energy deals  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday a fternoon but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receiv e in the Legislature    Contact Mark Gladstone at

By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Registe r  WASHINGTON The nations chief energy judge said Monday that California i s owed maybe 1 billion in refunds from power generators a fraction of the 89 billion demanded by Gov Gray Davis  And even at that said Judge Cu rtis Wagner the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power  bills that in the end California might not see one red cent  Wagner announ ced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after tw o weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to Californias e lectricity crisis With no settlement the matter is now in the commissione rs hands  Power generators Wagner said had offered a combined 716 mill ion in refunds an offer the state rejected I dont think its 89 billi on dollars he said afterwards because I havent been shown that it was   For California consumers every dollar the state can extract in refunds is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased pow er And the more money the state gets back the better the chances of wardi ng off future rate increases  California will get its 89 billion insi sted Michael Kahn head of the states delegation and the California Indepe ndent System Operator Kahn brushed off Wagners comments finding victory  in the judges assertion that the state is owed some refunds a concept the generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now he said  Since the t alks began some generators have made refund offers -- last week Duke Energ y offered 20 million and on Monday Reliant officials revealed their refun d offer was 50 million provided all other actions against the company wer e dropped  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that  California is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price goug ing by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC If unsuccessful there the whole issue could wind up in court for ye ars  You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink Wagner sai d during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommen dation He has seven days to put his ideas in writing At several points du ring the often-tense talks Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and tried to get them to agree even to the point of holding an unpreceden ted Sunday session  The numbers were too far apart Wagner said  While  Kahn insisted the state had made progress on hearing of the judges commen ts state Sen John Burton D-Francisco called them barely better than a  jab in the eye with a sharp stick Burton agreed with Kahn that the state  has to do all it can to get more than that  And Davis backed up his team  Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there we re overcharges made because the market was broken Davis said Remarkably  the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibi lity to the people of California and own up to their profiteering  Power  generators seemed satisfied with the judges views even though John Stout vice president of Reliant Energy said his companys fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified  Brent Bailey genera l counsel for Duke Energy called the judges recommendation a fair one Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis failed energy policies that brought California to this point They also distanced themselves from the states refund request  I dont believe there really exists a true justification for that number said Assemblyman John Campbe ll R-Irvine Ive never considered that anything more than a wild number  to throw out there  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of  overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu te the complex pricing structure And Wagner was more persuaded with the ma jority of the generators methods  To start with the state is asking for  89 billion but about 3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be tween May and October 2000 a period FERC is not looking at FERC issued tw o refund orders in March finding that power companies had 124 million in  overcharges during power alerts But the state is challenging that finding saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times And the state is also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000   How energy panel affects California  Six months ago few people had heard o f FERC Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency charged wi th making sure that the nations power markets are running smoothly and tha t wholesale prices are just and reasonable rolls off the tongue  The fi ve commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home  states Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that co ncluded Monday They had hoped all the parties involved in Californias ele ctricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds long-term pow er contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months FER Cs chief judge Curtis Wagner was asked to mediate the talks  WHAT WAS A T STAKE  For the state 89 billion that Gov Gray Davis said was the amo unt power companies overcharged California in the past year Wagners findi ng There should be refunds But more like 1 billion  For the generators More than 5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills W agners finding Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe C alifornia He did not specify by how much  For California consumers A sta ble electricity market Until the refund issue is settled and power prices  are stabilized long term what the future holds for rate increase remains u ncertain Wagners finding No settlement Consumers still in limbo  HOW D ID WE GET HERE  In spring 2000 wholesale power prices began to soar The  state began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices In the meantime the  utilities were running out of money Generators werent paid for all the el ectricity they sold Rolling blackouts began  Starting in January the sta te began buying the power replacing the near-bankrupt utilities Politicia ns from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rate s More than 27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year c ompared with 7 billion the year before The price tag could reach 50 bill ion this year  On June 19 FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps expert s say could moderate wholesale rates Wholesale prices have come down but  the caps have caused confusion among generators leading some to hold some  power off the market  WHATS NEXT  The FERC commissioners will receive Wa gners report within a week In it he will suggest they hold a fast-track  formal hearing that would last no more than 60 days  If they agree after  that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California mark et issues  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagr ee they can contest FERCs decision in court Such legal proceedings could last many years

days in May Californias daily power allowance topped 100 million according  to a report released by state power traders  The California Department of  Water Resources released the report Monday along with 1770 pages of docum ents that also detailed the last- minute power purchases the state made on  the spot market in the first three months of the year  The report details  the departments electricity spending since Jan 17 when the state took ov er electricity purchases for Pacific Gas  Electric Co San Diego Gas  El ectric Co and Southern California Edison  The utilities had amassed bill ions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power Sin ce then the state has spent nearly 8 billion to keep the lights on  The  states daily spending peaked May 10 at 1024 million The second-highest  daily total was May 23 when the state spent 1018 million  But since May  spot-market prices have dropped due in part to moderate weather lower n atural gas prices increased conservation that lowered demand and because o f increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price man ipulation Gov Gray Davis has said long-term contracts also drove the pric e down  It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down  but it looks like its primarily due to natural gas prices said Jamie Fis fis spokesman for Assembly Republicans  The slight reduction in spot-mark et prices underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long -term contracts if natural gas prices continue to drop Fisfis said  Mos t of the long-term contracts run for 10 years with one lasting for 20 year s  Davis already has released details of the states long-term power contr acts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several ne ws organizations  But Davis wanted to delay the release of the spot-market buys and short-term contracts until now to keep the states buying strateg y secretAccording to the state Atlanta-based Mirant Corp got 124 billi on as of May 31 for spot-market purchases  Canadian Powerex the marketing arm of BC Hydro has been paid 105 billion  The newly released short-te rm contracts also show that on March 19-20 when the state had rolling blac kouts the state paid above-average prices in its largest short-term contra cts  For example Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usa ge times on March 20 for 345 a megawatt-hour more than 70 above the aver age price of 27296                 Tuesday July 10 2001        Ghost o f Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray Davis is following footsteps of former OC treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN MW MOORLACH  Mr Moorla ch is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector   A recent LA Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers fr om a shortage of energy Perhaps the states subsidizing of the actual cost s for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that ever ything is fine It is not  The state has been spending an average of 57 m illion a medium-sized citys annual budget per day for electricity Now C alifornia is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed  on its shareholder-owned utilities finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankr uptcy and another on the precipice At this pace it will not be long befor e the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face  Tha ts why Im gnawed by this dj vu sensation The similarities and parall els between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening H eres a refresher In 1994 the county through former Treasurer Robert Citr on was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates The expe rts and the politicos were comfortable with the investment scheme  No w onder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieti es Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was i nvesting and what his exit strategy would be Guess what The unexpected  happened Short-term borrowing rates doubled The cost of borrowing suddenl y exceeded the revenues being generated  It caused the investment pool to  implode and Orange County taxpayers realized a 164 billion loss In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the countys leadership he ignored it The rest is history In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme t he state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge It also eli minated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-ter m contracts  Guess what The unexpected happened The wholesale price for  electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap It d epleted the available funds for the utilities and then some and they are  imploding In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov Gray Davis t o avoid or minimize this train wreck he ignored them The rest is also his tory  It gets worse Davis doesnt allow for the immediate raising of reta il rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity Guess what The expected happened He depleted our budget surplus Our reserves Nearly 9 billion - and counting Hes a Citron only quintupled  And in  the light of day the secret purchases were not attractively priced and onl y compound this financial nightmare Gov Davis has done what no Libertaria n or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time He has retu rned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California by subsidizing their electricity bills  Bravo It may not be the most equ itable way of refunding taxes but has anyone ever thought up a more effici ent method But thats not all He wants it back Davis now wants to borro w some 13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more ele ctricity at rates in excess of the retail prices When does this train wrec k in slow motion stop  And how do we pay off these bonds Davis did not wa nt to raise rates last summer or this past winter But now he will to pay o ff this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant uti lity rate increase The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davi s is gone about his expensive brilliance And this elected official wants t o purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities I say no  If we dont show some leadership in Sacramento soon potential bond buyers will also say no unless they receive an attractive interest rate  Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates It just su bscribed 800 million in bonds paying 14 percent Tragically Gov Davis wa lked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangi ble legacy to show for it No reserves No improved highways No new school s No infrastructure improvements Only interest payments  Wasnt that Cit rons legacy If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent the citizens of Cali fornia will pay an additional 44 billion in interest costs Over 15 years its 67 billion And therein lies the true legacy of Davis squandering  the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his  indecisiveness and lack of leadership  It is so tragic that the perpetrato r of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the blame game Orange County played the blame game too But it had obvious perp etrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount i n retribution payments Im not so sure California will have a similar resu lt            Calpines Los Medanos Energy Center Adds

Column 1  c 2001 New York Times Co mpany  WASHINGTON July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiat ions about California s demands for electricity refunds today with the st ate and power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the t alks began  The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to which the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab out 1 billion California  which wants 89 billion vowed today that it  would seek that much and more through the courts if necessary  Although e lectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks the power crisis  that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be

companies began grossly overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2 0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year Generators say they are prepared to pay some refunds but argue that California s es timates of overcharges are radically inflated  The mediator in the settlem ent talks was Curtis L Wagner Jr an administrative law judge for the fed eral agency who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c omprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought  Mr Wagner said he would  recommend to the agencys commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti ary hearing that would impose an administrative solution He also said he w ould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity   Under  federal law the energy commission has the obligation to ensure just and  reasonable electricity rates Though the commission declared last year th at California s electricity market had broken down it only recently began imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o f past overcharges systematically  While the scope of any refunds remains  uncertain Mr Wagners remarks appeared more favorable for generators than for Western states which have collectively pressed for as much as 15 bil lion in refunds  Mr Wagner said that to determine how much California sho uld have paid for power since last September when the commission began mon itoring California energy prices he would suggest that the agency retroact ively apply a price control formula it adopted in June He also indicated t hat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar d by California officials The judge suggested that the formula he is recom mending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or mayb e a billion dollars  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju dges statements calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled ged that companies would have to pay some refunds They also noted that wha tever the level of federally mandated refunds they would have the option o f seeking more in court  We are still going to get the 89 billion s aid Michael Kahn who represented Gov Gray Davis of California in the talk s If we dont get it all from the commission we will get the remainder  in the courts  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did  not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed it would sue generators for 18 billion to 20 billion We are in a war with generato rs mostly out of state that are trying to bleed us dry Mr Davis said speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California   Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se ttlement talks they collectively offered to refund California about 500 m illion They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w ould result in refunds of no more than 15 billion -- far closer to their  offer than to California s demand  Still several executives said they no w hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t hreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol lars they say they are owed by the state and its leading financially press ed utilities which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year  We  remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that  will put this problem behind us once and for all said Brent Bailey vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy       Financial  Energy Refu nd Talks Fail In Calif Federal Agencys Judge To Propose Settlement Peter Behr    07102001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001  The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved  California consumers were over charged by as much as 1 billion by electricity suppliers since October a  federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges  Gov Gray Davis D and California power officials wanted 89 billion in refunds da ting back to May 2000 when the states energy crisis began  A group of ge nerating companies headed by units of Duke Energy Corp Reliant Energy Inc  and Williams Cos offered refunds of 7161 million in the past week goi ng back to October The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg er amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state  The nu mbers were too far apart Curtis L Wagner Jr chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told reporters after two weeks of closed neg otiations ended yesterday Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i mprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f igure  Calpine Corp of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec ted to reach individual settlements with the state the judge said  A lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didnt Wagner told  reporters Theres an old southern saying said the 72-year-old Tennessea n You can take a horse to water but you cant make it drink  He declin ed to say which side balked but previously he had blasted California offic ials for not modifying their initial demands  Wagner said he will send his own refund formula to FERCs five commissioners within a week His formula essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul d have been in the state at various times since October considering fuel c osts and other factors Charges over those levels would be subject to refun d if FERC agrees  The judges recommendation is likely to carry considera ble weight with FERCs commissioners according to energy analysts Earlier this year FERC tentatively ordered 125 million in refunds for the first  three months of this year an amount that Davis called far too low  Facing increasing political pressure from Congress FERC -- with two new members  appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California s pow er prices Last month the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholes ale power transactions in California and 10 other western states Wagner pa tterned his formula after FERCs ruling last month  The nations wealthies t state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas  prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from 7 billion in 1999 to an estimated 27 billion last year Power prices did not retreat from reco rd levels until last month  Daviss top aides quickly claimed vindication  yesterday  We think the numbers even using the judges formula are goin g to be in the multiple billions said Michael Kahn chairman of the Calif ornia Independent System Operator the states power grid manager  Kahn no ted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against t he principal energy suppliers most of them headquartered outside the state  The companies had insisted on being released from the states legal claim s as part of any settlement according to sources close to the negotiations   We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for  the remainder Kahn said  California will get its 89 billion  But th e states own expert witness economist Eric Hildebrandt chief market moni tor for the California grid testified before Wagner that the out-of-state  generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about 37 billion using FERCs pricing formula of last month -- less than half the 89 bill ion goal  Duke Energy is very pleased by Wagners action said Brent Ba iley vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company Th e generators however repeated their claims that Davis is trying to make t hem scapegoats for the states failed electricity deregulation plan  The m ajor generators in a statement yesterday said they had delivered only 20  million megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used fro m October 2000 to last May A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750 homes  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped la rge profits the generators said  The refunds sought by California would  send a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers when prices are l ow and surpluses exist you face a steep downside when scarcity develops a nd prices rise we will take away all upside profit No one will invest i n California power facilities in that climate the generators statement  said The power supply shortage thus will continue without relief   http wwwwashingtonpostcom  Contact httpwwwwashingtonpostcom           Economy   California and Energy Companies Miss Deadline By Richard B Sch mitt    07102001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  Copyright c 2001  Dow Jones  Company Inc  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling 89 billion of  disputed California electricity charges as a federal mediator overseeing t he talks suggested the states demand was excessive  Cautioning that he ha dnt done formal calculations Curtis L Wagner Jr the chief administrati ve law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the level of  potential refunds at hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion doll ars He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies it s insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills  Mr Wagner said he would  recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from Octobe r -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling That decision alone would shav e 3 billion from the 89 billion claim  Mr Wagner who is expected to i ssue formal findings in the next few days said he would recommend that the FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring refunds  The collapse of the talks doesnt preclude individual deals late r between energy companies and the state which has accused them of overcha rging for power during the past two years Yesterday some industry lawyers indicated a willingness to keep bargaining and Mr Wagner said two parti al settlements were in the works  Yet absent any such solution the over charge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to b e resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings which could drag on for months or even years  The negotiations began June 25 with a deadl ine set for midnight last night But late yesterday participants indicated they were billions of dollars apart with basic differences over everythin g from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC which ordered the talks could enforce a deal because of the industrys questions about  the reach of the agencys authority  We havent reached a settlement We  really havent come close said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli ant Energy Incs wholesale-power group Reliant had offered to pay Califor nia about 50 million to extricate itself from the fight That is more than a third of the Houston companys operating profit during the relevant peri od he said although far shy of the more than 375 million California soug ht from Reliant  Mr Wagner said the industry offered a total of 716 mill ion to settle the matter  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the  agencys authority and credibility The FERC a onetime regulatory backwate r has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito ring of deregulated California markets The commission has ordered some com panies to pay refunds but they have been relatively small -- such as a 12 4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu ary and February  California Gov Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER C members will take a much more aggressive tack The agency is expected to  act quickly on the judges call for a hearing and other findings  Yesterda y Michael Kahn a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov Davis at the sett lement declared he was gratified by Mr Wagners findings saying they v alidated the states claims to some refunds a concept the industry had rej ected at the talks outset Weve had a ringing endorsement of the idea of refunds and well get back lots of money he said adding that what the s tate doesnt recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court  But power genera tors who derided the states request for a huge refund as ludicrous and  unsound felt vindicated by yesterdays proceedings The state came away with far less than its expectations said Robert Loeffler an attorney fo r a unit of AES Corp of Arlington Va The common expectation now is that any refunds will be way below this 9 billion09

Ed Duncan EricaManueledelmancom Fairchild Tracy Subject IMPORTANT   Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that E SPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commissio n by December 3  The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who  sign a suitable protective order  The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow 1     By December 3 2001 any party who believes that it has a direct acc ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc t access as of July 1 2001 or a date earlier than September 20 2001 shal l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order  A failure  to submit this information for the Commissions consideration will be consi dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a nd agreements  Initially the true and correct copy of each of the actual  contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commissions Doc ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge ALJ Robert Barnettxm lnamespace prefix 3D o ns 3D urnschemas-microsoft-comofficeoffice  2     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff which shall be  submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3 20 3     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission  staff by December 11 200120 4     Parties supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja nuary 4 2002 As a preliminary matter of course AReM and WPTF do not in their own name s have direct access contracts  However certain members of AReM and WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they wish to take  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds  I will be considering our  options and get back to you with more detail  However as a very prelimina ry analysis it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o ver either ESPs or the customers they serve  The request is also particula rly outrageous because of the statements that A failure to submit this in formation for the Commissions consideration will be considered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements  and Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement s are in effect  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend ent customers 20 20 Your thoughts would be appreciated  My initial reaction  is that this is t ime for ESPs and customer groups such as CMTA ABAG CLECA CIU EPUC SPU RR etc to band together and fight this at multiple levels from the Gove rnors Office on down including in the media  Your thoughts would be very much appreciated 20 Dan 20 Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass 5959 Topanga Canyon Blvd  Suite 244 Woodland Hills CA 91367 Tel   818 596-2201 Fax  818 346-6502 douglassenergyattorneycom

to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a 33 billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diego-based Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss SACRAMENTO -- Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 23 million homes - by June That would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers - even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1000 megawatts - would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent The long-term goal is 17 percent The remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from so-called peaker plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service If California can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes Nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts They note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio That assessment wont be done until February I hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network a consumer watchdog group Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the states businesses are critical They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there Lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies Leading the 5 million-a-year agency is Freeman the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis closest advisers during the energy crisis The Legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month Its not an investigation said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Felton chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee But its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law Keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter We did what we could We kept the rates stable and lights on Freeman said Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight

The two politicians whove arguably benefited most from the national focus  on war are both Californians -- Congressman Gary Condit and Governor Gray D avis Too bad Mr Davis is finding he still cant avoid his own chickens co ming home to roost20 Only now are the folks in Sacramento learning that their Governors soluti on to the energy crisis has been a political sham A combination of collap sing budget revenues foolish spending and bad credit ratings threatens to  plunge the state into a full-fledged financial crisis Governor Daviss chickens left the roost back in May 2000 when California s botched scheme to deregulate electric power encountered a wicked price bu bble Wholesale prices which had been deregulated shot up while retail p rices which were still regulated didnt budge This mismatch along with  other factors generated huge supply disruptions and a first-class energy c risis20 The obvious response would have been to let retail rates rise with the mark et price Mr Davis said so himself in his now infamous observation that if he raised rates the problem would be solved in 20 minutes Mr Davis pref erred to play the blame game including a lot of whining that he had inheri ted the situation20 While the Governor complained Californias two largest utilities were push ed into insolvency and neighboring states endured the double whammy of havi ng their power sucked into California and seeing their electric rates shoot up Californians suffered through rolling blackouts20 Finally this past January -- eight months after the energy crisis began --the Governor responded Retail rates were increased twice and the state s tarted to purchase power directly from suppliers using money from its gene ral fund At the same time the state negotiated contracts with suppliers a t prices that are now well above market prices and for terms as long as 20  years20 And then Mr Davis got lucky Although the forecast was for a summer of con tinued blackouts generated by a strong demand for power the disaster faile d to materialize Not only was the weather cooler than normal but higher r ates produced immediate conservation thus demand was moderate and power su fficient Newsweek went out and hailed the Governor as a political Lazarus 20 But now here come the chickens It seems that almost one-quarter of Califor nias budget revenues were provided by taxpayers with stock options and cap ital gains mostly from Silicon Valley companies When the dot-com industry started to implode so did revenue projections -- to 12 billion this year  down from 18 billion last year And this was before September 11 and the collapse in the Nasdaq market20 California would probably be able to absorb this revenue hit were it not fo r the still outstanding bills from the Governors electric power fiasco Co nsider the toll20 -- Somebody is going to have to pay for the 14 billion that the utilities  owe to suppliers for power consumed before the state started buying electri city20 -- Somebody is going to have to repay the 125 billion bond issue that Cal ifornia hopes to float to replenish the money borrowed from its general fun d20 -- Somebody is going to have to pay for those expensive long-term contract s that the state negotiated20 -- Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of 43 billion that  California got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering If t his loan is not repaid by November 1 its interest rate jumps to 7 from 4  resulting in an extra 250000 in interest payments a day20 Whether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers or s ome combination of the two the impact on Californias economy and its budg et will be dreadful Observers are estimating a budget deficit of almost 1 0 billion for next year20 As for Governor Davis the problems of the previous administration are no w his own And Californians know it A recent statewide poll showed that mo st voters preferred the former mayor of Los Angeles Richard Riordan the l eading Republican challenger to Mr Davis by several points20 The Governors response to the ever-worsening economic situation has been t ypical He complains He vetoes a few spending bills He announces a 5 mil lion campaign to persuade Californians to help the local economy by staying in-state for their vacations We expect to see a lot of chickens on surfbo ards

right does the PGE creditor committee have to either 1 ask PGE whether its begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC andor 2 request that PGE begin talks  Im assuming that there may be some chance for 1 but very little if any for 2  Thanks Best Jeff Edison pact could point way for PGE The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony briefs and hearings Along with its statewide impacts which may not fully unfold for years the settlement with the states second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers who will pay billions to retire its debts One week after a federal judge approved the 635 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers From the start the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement It was negotiated in secret approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved Its definitely ambiguously worded said Steve Linsey a supervisor in the PUCs semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates On his first review of the deal he thought about 17 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates But that figure will be at least 33 billion and probably higher according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers Linsey said The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers In addition the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edisons finances sweeping in old debts and cash on hand and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off 635 billion in debts About three-fourths of that amount -- 49 billion -- appears to come from the utilitys customers Edisons investors will pick up 15 billion -- 12 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years and 300 million as a company contribution The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a 33 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills probably through the end of 2003 But thats not their only contribution Another 16 billion would come from Edisons cash on hand which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers In the end youre right the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers said Brian Bennett Edison vice president of external affairs But if Edison had won its suit Bennett said it would have been entitled to the full 635 billion without its shareholders taking any hit at all No one can know who would have won the Edison suit Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments So why did the PUC after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail chose to settle Partly the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas But he and others said there was another looming fear The PGE bankruptcy reorganization plan filed Sept 20 called for shifting utility assets including the companys hydroelectric plants nuclear plant and gas storage and pipeline network to a firm free from state regulation Peoples calculus was shaken up by what PGE did said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a consumer group It was just in the ether that oh God theres something really ugly out there We dont think they can get away with it but were not entirely sure The reorganization plan would leave a new PGE company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PGE and Edison They plan to fight PGEs efforts and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated They could say judge you dont have to do this bad deal that PGE wants We can work it out said Randy Chinn an adviser to state Sen Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey For its part PGE maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal But now the utility said it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utilitys efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge PGE will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution I think it would be smarter to be talking now he said A PGE rescue wouldnt follow the Edison settlement exactly because PGEs debts and costs are higher Cohen said but the PUCs goal would be the same goal it held for Edison a healthy regulated utility Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement We finally got to the point where we said look weve seen the alternatives and the alternatives are something like what PGE is trying to do or having the state take over the business of buying power Cohen said Most people at the commission he said concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January Cohen who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing Bilas said if it had leaked so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed At a closed session before approving it he said every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process full information and proper hearings It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow Bilas Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this said Florio the consumer advocate This could be the beginning of something really ugly In addition if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures a flurry of suits could follow said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates Office

Non-PrivilegedDasovich JeffSent Items X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune 100701 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs In a span of three hours last week the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a 33 billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diego-based Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register 100701 SACRAMENTO -- Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 23 million homes - by June That would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers - even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1000 megawatts - would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent The long-term goal is 17 percent The remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from so-called peaker plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service If California can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes Nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts They note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio That assessment wont be done until February I hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network a consumer watchdog group Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the states businesses are critical They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there Lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies Leading the 5 million-a-year agency is Freeman the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis closest advisers during the energy crisis The Legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month Its not an investigation said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Felton chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee But its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law Keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter We did what we could We kept the rates stable and lights on Freeman said Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight

Stephanie Tycholiz Barry Ward Kim Dasovich Jeff Cantrell Rebecca W Lawner Leslie Reitmeyer Jay Cc	Tholt Jane M Subject	Socal Window Meeting Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures  No hand-outs were provided Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcfd Ehrenberg 1250 mmcfd Needles 800 mmcfd Wheeler 800 mmcfd New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcfd Hector Rd 50 mmcfd Both will be available around Feb 1 Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system  Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well  Lots of complaints   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system  Eliminating point specific calculation  Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures  No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002   No direct dial-up Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party  However can still make  changes  Can still upload new files 2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline 213-244-3900 and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers  Gas Select is official notification  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific  OFOs can be declared intraday  Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day  Concerned that if call off will have to put back on  Dont want to go back and forth  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcfday between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned Scheduled vs Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110 of expected usage Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week  Can revise expected usage No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110 of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy  Generators need to revise expected usage  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle 4  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called  Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle 1    Nom 1000   0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized  Will allocate prorata  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point  In other words if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from 12 oclock to 12 oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered For OFO assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week  Declare OFO on prior days scheduled volume For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes  For example Flow Day 104                103 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 104 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 104 In other words will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th  look at evening cycle 2 on 104 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes All customers must comply Minimum delivery requirements 50 of daily usage over

14 2001 State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929 Following hours of closed-door meetings Enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines Under the deal Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over It took too long to bring this to resolution said state Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana who chairs the committee I cant help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt As part of the deal however Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman Karen Denne She said the company is still considering its options Were pleased theyve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges Denne said Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11 The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds including those with specific details -- prices quantities and capacity -- of the companies transactions in the states wholesale electricity market Enron officials balked at the request saying they didnt want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets Ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate Thursday morning the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committees contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate along with suggested punishments in the form of fines After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences At 6 pm Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies In addition the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at 916 326-5540 or ebazarsacbeecom mailtoebazarsacbeecom Enron and state reach agreement on papers The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market September 14 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents While delaying the decision Senate Leader John Burton D-San Francisco ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets Lets hope cooler minds prevail said Rules Committee member Sen Ross Johnson R-Irvine as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting The contempt proceedings for now have been dropped said Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nations two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California said Dunn who asked for the counsels review and recommendation Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS September 13 2001 SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committees quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt In June the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the states wholesale electricity market Enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected The judge agreed however that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana chairman of the select committee said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators With that agreement Dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt He asked Sen John Burton D-San Francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against Enron for each day they didnt comply with the subpoena The daily fines would start at 1000 doubling each day for 10 days Then the company would be fined 1 million a day Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them But Dennis Murphy a lawyer for the select committee said Enron didnt tell investigators where the depository was located The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case he said Weve been trying to get into the depository for a week They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said Kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents The two parties havent met since the judge ordered the protective order and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the orders details Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order Sen Ross Johnson R-Irvine said Dunns push to have Enron found in contempt smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate A contempt finding against Mirant Corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committees investigators If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron it will be the first time since 1929 when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state

Profit It Reported From Sandra Yamane Karen Dont know if you saw this article --------------------DWP Far Exceeded Profit It Reported --------------------Energy An independent audit finds the utilitys return was double the 15 the agency said it made selling power during the crisis Officials deny price gouging By DOUG SMITH RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J LOPEZ Times Staff Writers September 10 2001 During the peak of Californias power crisis the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged according to a newly completed independent audit The document obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes The audit also undercuts efforts by Gov Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private out-of-state generating companies For months DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15 above its costs As recently as July former DWP chief S David Freeman who now heads Davis new statewide power authority repeated that assurance in a letter to US senators probing the energy meltdown But the audit findings show that DWPs profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56 last year under Freemans stewardship Overall during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May records show that the DWP profited 200 million on sales of 680 million It says it is still owed 180 million Beyond those higher profits the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity They include a 34-million cut for the citys general fund--essentially a bonus for the utilitys owner--and an additional 42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agencys capital investments These overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators In effect unsuspecting ratepayers across the state whose utilities have been battered by debt are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay In an interview late last week Freeman defended those costs and DWPs profits saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants He insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than 15 We made a fair amount of money It was not price gouging said Freeman who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year Freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15 then Im not embarrassed about it It says nothing more than theres enterprise at the DWP The DWPs new general manager David Wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freemans tenure Maybe in hindsight Wiggs said it would have been better not to be so specific but to say Look were gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers  Still Wiggs said even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive We charged just and reasonable rates he said adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin Wiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity Conducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers the study targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000 The results have provided critics with new ammunition Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said Harry Snyder senior advocate for Consumers Union This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks savings and loans and insurance companies--not a public agency Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee which is investigating the crisis was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWPs profits were limited to 15 This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny he said after learning of the audit It would be ironic if it turns out that the LA Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov Davis Texas Pirates  said Thompson The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding To keep the power flowing the DWP--which had opted out of deregulation--cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market This helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced At the same time however the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports would later show Freeman repeatedly said the utilitys prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly inefficient plants But the audit raises such serious questions about the DWPs behavior that the matter has spilled into the 2002 gubernatorial contest Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan a possible Republican challenger to Davis last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure In a letter to his successor James K Hahn the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling If so he said the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated 180 million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales A Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales said Jaime de la Vega a senior advisor to Riordans campaign committee Freeman now squarely in the Davis camp disputes Riordans account He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agencys pricing strategy He wanted to charge more according to Freeman in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas  Electric and Southern California Edison which were slipping into insolvency Freeman described Riordans view as If were gonna continue to sell it to them we ought to get a lot of money He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it For the most part the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in Californias haywire energy market Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market including his agency But according to a report by the states grid operator DWP was one of the most aggressive along with the trading arm of BC Hydro the government-owned utility in British Columbia Yet another report--this one by the states power-buying agency--found that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year The report said DWP charged an average of 292 per megawatt hour asking more than many private generators It could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher Even after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year the DWP collected profits more than 40 higher than it claimed to have netted records show Overall during the 13-month period audited profits averaged 29 double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving Although Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities One key question is whether those agencies like private suppliers should be forced to refund excess profits The primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged DWP insists it is outside the commissions jurisdiction But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities The leading proponent of that course is state Sen Ray Haynes R-Riverside In a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies The chairman of that committee Sen Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead For information about reprinting this article

EMINENT DOMAIN ABX2 35 Vargas D-San Diego authorizes the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority to exercise eminent domain to acquire generating facilities for 18-24 months  Generators would be reimbursed a reasonable rental value as opposed to fair market value for facilities temporarily taken by the State  Co-generation facilities are not exempt from the bill CMTA is opposed and the bill may not move  It is rumored that a Legislative Counsel opinion questions its constitutionality The bill is currently in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee ELECTRICAL GENERATION - STRICT LIABILITY ABX2 51 Reyes D-Fresno provides that a resale or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility that reduces or discontinues service for solely economic reasons shall be held strictly liable for any damages proximately caused by that reduction or discontinuance  Economic reasons is defined as the withholding of power for financial gain Cogeneration is exempted from the bill CMTA is opposed  According to the authors staff the measure will not be moved The bill is in Assembly ECA Committee ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS - ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES Despite rigorous debate on the Assembly Floor on September 4 the Assembly adopted amendments to ABX2 65 Cardoza D-Merced which make the bill less onerous  As amended the measure makes it a wobbler for any person or entity whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity to exercise market power  Market power is defined as the profitable maintenance of wholesale electricity prices above the prices that would occur in the wholesale market if that market were competitive  The measure also allows the imposition of a fine of up to 10 percent of the violators gross assets upon conviction  Felony penalties would apply to any person or entity that exercised market power during a Stage 1 2 or 3 electrical emergency as determined by the Independent System Operator The September 4 amendments limit the bill to apply only to entities whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity that are able to exercise market power and technically exempt qualifying facilities co-generation or self-generation  The measure still includes onerous bounty-hunter provisions that authorize the Attorney General to pay a reward to any person who provides information that materially contributes to the imposition of a criminal fine  The reward would be equal to 10 of the amount of the criminal fine collected by the AG district attorney or imposed by the court  The measure likely will be taken up for a vote on the Assembly Floor sometime this week TAX - TRIAL DE NOVO AB 934 Hertzberg D-Van Nuys  CMTA supports reforms to the property tax assessment appeal process granting courts more power to overturn decisions that are anti-taxpayer Assessors and counties claim that they will be manipulated into settling disputes too cheaply  They obtained a Leg Counsel opinion declaring it to violate the California Constitution The bill is in Senate Rules  CMTA is lobbying to ensure that it is sent to Appropriations and are lobbying members of that committee as well as members whose votes will be needed on the floor  There is speculation that it is being held in Rules for leverage for a larger deal but it is more probable that it is a tactic to delay it until Hertzberg the author is no longer Speaker CORPORATE COUNSEL - PROTECTIVE ORDERCONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS AB 36 Steinberg D-Sacramento SB 11 Escutia D-Whittier AB 881 Simitian D-Palo Alto  CMTA opposes these bills to potentially expose proprietary information to the public  SB 11 and AB 36 drive up litigation costs for defendants leveraging higher settlements AB 36 was Speakerized with the proviso that its substance would not go to the Governor that SB 11 would be the vehicle and be revised into a more business friendly version  Nevertheless AB 36 unchanged has received a rule waiver allowing it to move in the Senate CMTA is working on keeping the moderate Democrats in the Assembly from passing SB 11 and if AB 36 does go to the Governor in having them help with obtaining a veto  CMTA is proposing AB 881 as an alternative though it is preferred that it not pass and the trial lawyers would likely kill it  At this point it appears that the moderates will stay with us but it appeared that way just before they caved-in in June EDUCATION - CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION AB 348 Wright D-So Central Los Angeles  Several voc-ed bills designed to bolster this ailing system were passed by the Legislature this year including AB 348 which introduces mechanisms to elevate the academic standing of such courses  Unfortunately much of the funding for the voc-ed bills was cut out of the Budget EDUCATION - FACILITIES BOND AB 16 Hertzberg D-Van NuysLeonard R-San Bernardino and SB 844 Chesbro D-Arcata  CMTA has declared support for this legislation to place a statewide school facilities bond on the ballot in 2002 Their scope spans K-College  A conference committee is addressing the timing for the ballot March vs November the amount and the allocation between K-12 and higher ed and the allocation system to use among schools HOUSING CMTA supports two bills AB 1284 Lowenthal D-Long Beach which provides property tax rewards to local jurisdictions within specified job centers basically all of the major urban areas which approve and build housing affordable to the local workforce  SB 910 Dunn D-Santa Ana would impose sanctions on local jurisdictions which chronically fail to plan for their housing needs  Both bills are in their second houses but are two-year projects  Their terms will be negotiated during the interim 36 BILLION WORKERS COMPENSATION BILL ON THE GOVERNORS DESK The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers compensation benefits bill on September 6   The bill is now on its way to the Governor  The bill SB 71 Burton would cost employers 36 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to help offset the increased cost  The quick passage of the bill by the Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a negotiating mood There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor entered the fray on Thursday August 30 by revealing a 15 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous to employers  However the proposal caused Senator Burton and his co-author Assemblyman Calderon to call a hasty press conference where the governors proposal was characterized as a slap in the face to labor  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB 71 would spark a ballot initiative that could double employers costs  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or someone else Steve Smith Director Department of Industrial Relations and the governors point person on workers compensation said the governors plan became public only after it was presented to a group of labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion about how best to get a workers compensation bill that the governor is comfortable with  Smith dismissed the threat of labor turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else Now that the bill is on the Governors desk it is imperative that employers write the Governor requesting a veto  For information on SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at httpwwwcmtanetpress082301workcompshtml UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SB 40 Alarcon D-Sylmar would increase unemployment insurance UI cost by over 3 billion over four years and includes several other onerous changes for employers  The bill is in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on the suspense file and is opposed by CMTA Unlike workers compensation UI has only two active parties of interest labor and employers  CMTA believes that employers are more vulnerable to a benefit increase in UI than workers compensation because our maximum benefit level is the second lowest of all the states  Therefore employer representatives from CMTA Cal-Chamber Cal-Tax and Newspaper Publishers Association met with the author and labor to discuss a benefit increase and reforms to help offset some costs The coalition has put together a proposal to counter SB 40 CMTA does not believe that the Governor would sign two benefit bills in the same year unless they were both negotiated and agreed upon by both labor and management  According to the latest news the Governor asked labor to choose and labor decided on the workers compensation bill this session  Therefore no further action on UI will be taken this session STORMWATER SB 72s author Senator Kuehl D-Santa Monica and the bill sponsor Santa-Monica-based Heal The Bay agreed to remove all of the controversial minimum stormwater monitoring requirements affecting industrial facilities  Most notably the August 21 version deletes the proposed increase in stormwater sampling frequency and language requiring inclusion of additional constituents in each sampling event  The current version also deletes all references to group monitoring - a regulatory program designed to streamline monitoring requirements for similar industrial facilities - which was originally prohibited  These changes will spare individual facilities from thousands of dollars in increased stormwater monitoring costs  All opposition has been removed and the amendments lower the states anticipated costs substantially  The next hurdle is the state water boards renewal of the General Industrial Stormwater Permit next year SAFE DRINKING WATER  TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act Proposition 65 SB 471 Sher was amended on July 5 to incorporate language developed by the Attorney Generals office  It is intended to help curb frivolous litigation invited by lucrative bounty hunter provisions that has overwhelmed the AGs resources  Although advertised as a pro-business reform measure the AGs proposal undermined the certainty of Prop 65 settlements by allowing a district attorney city attorney or private prosecutor to sue again for the same alleged offense  The AG and Senator Sher have since agreed to remove that provision and make other lesser changes to avoid opposition from the business community  The bill requires a 23 vote which may not be achievable without a commitment from the AG to pursue further discussions toward more substantive reform 2002 PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FORECAST Water Quality Standards - SB 469 Alpert D-Coronado  Held up in end of session politics the bill advances consensus recommendations to improve regional implementation of federal Total Maximum Daily Load program  Requires state water board to develop guidelines for regional boards on listing and de-listing water bodies and implementing TMDLs  Would help focus state resources on legitimate water quality problems  May move as urgency legislation in January 2002 Wastewater Discharge Offset Program - SB 815 Machado D-Linden Two-year vehicle to address the affects of legacy sources of pollution eg abandoned mines without bankrupting the discharger community  Would provide less costly alternatives to end-of-the pipe permit limits such as investing in upstream cleanup projects with greater environmental benefits Environmental Justice  Under pressure from environmental activists CARB is pursuing an aggressive agenda that does not track legislative direction  Staff will present draft guidelines to the Board in December  CARBs work will serve as a model for other Cal-EPA agencies required by SB 115 Solis 1999 and SB 89 Escutia 2000 to review their programs to address environmental justice concerns Toxic Injuries - SB 693 Scott D-Altadena  Two-year measure sponsored by trial lawyers to extend the statute of limitations for filing injury claims related to hazardous material exposures  Anticipate an oppose position Brownfields Cleanup Incentives - AB 1114 Pescetti  Stalled this year due to politics surrounding Senator Escutias local agency enforcement-based program in SB 32  AB 1114 seeks flexible risk-based cleanup standards innocent operator liability relief and modest financial incentives for parties seeking to voluntarily initiate cleanup and redevelopment wwwcmtanet httpwwwcmtanet California Manufacturers  Technology Association 980 9th Street Suite 2200 Sacramento CA  95814 916 441-5420 phone 916 447-9401 fax You are receiving this message today because your company is a valued member of the California Manufacturers  Technology Association CMTA  While wed be pleased to continue to tell you about CMTAs efforts to make California a better place for manufacturing you can unsubscribe by e-mailing a message to memberscmtanet

Rosman Stewart Scholtes Diana Semperger Cara Stokley Chris Swain Steve Swerzbin Mike Symes Kate Walton Steve Williams III Bill Subject	FW FERC Meeting Summary Importance	High Todays FERC meeting was a big deal   Some of the key actions are DSTAR and RTO West are to be married  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12101 or possibly 1215 not sure of date  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided below Alan Comnes The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues  The following is a summary of the meeting  The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks  1 organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like and 2 substantive -- once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No 2000 into RTO structures  To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October 15-19 in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as  congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No 888 transmission tariff  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation  Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO  If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis  Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs  Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there  In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops End of October -- further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December 15 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers  As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers  As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers  As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it  We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues  Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days  In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over  Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

Charles Mi essner Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Karen Shea Max Bulk Subject DA Suspended but NOT retroactively The Commission has just voted 3-2 to approve the draft ALJ Barnett decision  modified to be prospective only  There is NO retroactive suspension 20 Carl Wood introduced the ALJs draft decision with a diatribe against dire ct access  He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to  large customers and an example of the saying that big dogs eat first and  big dogs eat best  He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens ion and no retroactivity  He said he finds it hard to consider these comm ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous  He added that Smal l consumers effectively have no options  He said retroactivity will be th e subject of further review although it was not clear what this meant  Wi thin 14 days the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 92001  He said that dire ct access is half of the failed deregulation process the other half was op ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market  He said that supporter s of DA engage in hollow rhetoric  The market has failed in the state a nd We need to put an end to the lack of social responsibility in the elec tric market He concluded that several commenters had indicated that direct access was a way for making green power available to residential customers  He respond ed that this just means other customers are getting more dirty coal-fired p ower  He concluded that advocates of direct access make a fraudulent clai m of customer choice20 Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate responding to Wood  He sa id he had learned how to count and he can count to three  He then briefly summarized his alternate  First he expressed disappointment in the Sacra mento process and the fact that they had not yet done something to rescue d irect access  Second he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from that of other people  He said he had always opposed the AB 1890 provision that instituted the UDC buy-sell arrangement saying that it eliminated th e largest customers from direct access  Commissioner Duque then spoke brie fly to indicate his support for the Bilas alternate draft decision and his  strong support for direct access20 Commissioner Brown said first In the weight of these sad times we must ob ey  We are paying the price of the severe energy crisis which occurred las t year and the extraordinary means that were used to resolve it  In an or dinary market he thinks DA is good but there is no way it can coexist wit h the States 22 billion worth of bonds  Therefore there is no question  that it has to be suspended  We probably should have done so months ago  in order to avoid a last-minute stampede  There is an inequity between cu stomers that have moved to opt for direct access and those who have not  B ut sometimes you dont have a lot of good choices and this is one of thos e times  If future legislation comes forward and we hope that it would  the Commission will attempt to revise this action  20 President Lynch noted the State Senate leadership has written asking for a  study to be delivered by 1102 as to how DA can be maintained without bias to ratepayers and she supported this action20 Bilas and Duque indicated they will both file dissents20 In conclusion we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac cess suspension  We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su spension itself on legalprocedural grounds Dan 20

MaraNAEnron  cc Richard ShapiroNAEnronEnron  Subject CA Bond Legislation Language I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to 1 ensure that customers never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay and 2 try and find a compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a mwh basis Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge   I know that this is a very long shot  We should make this recommendation as a help to our business teams even if we are going to lose Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday Jim ---------------------- Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on

Legislation Language As discussed we have two possible approaches 1 Home Run Strategy The following change The commission shall within 30 days from the date of the application issue a bond financing order establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the commission with the exception of electric power delivered by suppliers other than the utility who contracted for such delivery prior to the effective date of this legislation We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the duration of the turmoil Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15  Thus if the wording gets changed to who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation we have failed Positive is that it removes the CPUC anti enron discretion 2 1st Base Strategy The following change c The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement  Such rates will be designed  i such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered and ii to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us  ie  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge Scott ---------------------- Forwarded by Scott StonessHOUEES on 07032001

Bond Legislation Language Harry  I read through the proposed legislation  In summary it Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California  subject to the jurisdiction of the commission The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31 2001 Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs SImilarly large San Diego customers who have not caused any DWR costs would be subject to a surcharge I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31 2001 Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31 2001 rates until the bond is paid off or Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds or this is the most likely meaning in my mind Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31 2001 If it is possible we should advocate Regarding SDGE customers who did not contribute to DWR costs Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California  subject to the jurisdiction of the commission The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements  Such rates will be designed  i such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered and ii to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused And we should get a legal interpretation of  The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31 2001  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised Scott

piped-in air supply crikey but then having a snorkel in ones mouth would render one unable to kiss effectively--ass or otherwise--thereby defeating the purpose of said object  Just--a--hold your breath shut your eyes and pucker up I always say  With practice one should get along fine without additional devices heh heh sheesh Thanks for the warning though as I will undoubtedly have a hangover Saturday morning resulting from our company Xmas party on the preceding evening I too am coming down with a cold so next week will be okay with me but is Monday night free  I have Bachs Christmas Oratorio with the Symphony all the rest of the week  If you and Prentice are interested I might be able to get you tickets --- Dasovich Jeff JeffDasovichenroncom wrote  pardon me while I puke  ill get

X-Origin DASOVICH-J X-FileName Dasovich Jeff Non-Privilegedpst FYI  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation Best Jeff Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune 100701 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs In a span of three hours last week the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a 33 billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diego-based Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register 100701 SACRAMENTO -- Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 23 million homes - by June That would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers - even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1000 megawatts - would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent The long-term goal is 17 percent The remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from so-called peaker plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service If California can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes Nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts They note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio That assessment wont be done until February I hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network a consumer watchdog group Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the states businesses are critical They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there Lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies Leading the 5 million-a-year agency is Freeman the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis closest advisers during the energy crisis The Legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month Its not an investigation said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Felton chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee But its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law Keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter We did what we could We kept the rates stable and lights on Freeman said Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight

Transwestern  gh -----Original Message-----From 	mbaldwinigservicecomENRON Sent	Tuesday October 16 2001 550 PM To	Hass Glen Subject	Bilas  Proposed Decision SoCal GIR Glen I have reviewed the 101001 Revised PD of Comr Bilas as requested In view of the entirety of TWs interest I still ascertain that TW can support the current 1010 PD Noted below for your information and review is a summary of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering  1Market concentration limits reduced from 40 to 30  of available receipt point capacity TW has preferred no limits to market concentration historically However as before I do not believe pushing this issue will be successful or productive for TW There are no market concentration limits in the secondary market Although Bilas warns market participants that any misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation P44 2SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity I dont see any negative impact on TW perhaps positive P45 3Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120  of SoCal firm rate This is the same cap that applies to SoCal I dont like the precedent set in this area however it assures that the economic value allocation between SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transportsupply scenario P46 4Not really a change  but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd as a deliveryreceipt at Ferc 5PD does not reduce the cores interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels Current level 1044 MMcfd proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage 70 BCF 327 MMcfd of injection and 1935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed 55 BCF  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this changeP 52 54 6 CTAs Core Transport Agents allowed to reject only their prorata share of non-reliability storage service No impact on TW interests P 58 7 SoCal directed to presentvia Advice Ltr how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers I see no impact on TW P62 8PD rejects the requirement that SoCalSDGE file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider  I see only positive attributes of this change for TW P63 9Preserves the right for SoCalSDGE to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator NO impact on TW P66 10PD orders a 10  cap on ITCS stranded costresponsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity No direct impact upon TW interest however likely a touchy point with noncore interest P 75 11 PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD Additionally noncore customers to pay 50 of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements No negative impact on TW Noncore customers bear additional expense The PD estimates an additional 18 million over next 5 to 6 years P 78 The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be approx  444 Million 12 PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of  00039 to 24 cents No impact on TW interest P83 13 PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis No impact on TW P85-87 14Generally the PD makes some administrative changes to the small coreESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation  NO impact on TW interest P 88-100 15Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA Owing to the fact that SoCal has already started to implement portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc Bottomline not consequential to the approval of the PD No direct impact upon TW interest P 103-110 On whole the centerpiece of TWs interest in this proceeding remains intact The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with SoCal backbone facilities TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd Mojave is recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations Points for comments 1 TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts 2 Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty 3 The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCals intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices 4 The PD correctly observes that the PGE market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well during Californias challenging energy markets 5TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing The Commission promising options are still valid in todays gas market Further SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements 6TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD ON THIS POINT TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call Mark IGS Mark IGS

is now very public  Davis is likely losing his mind  Can Ron Carroll or Dan Watkiss search these filings down at FERC  Thanks Best Jeff State PUC seeks to void Daviss power contracts Deals gouge consumers agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine Californias hard-won control of the power market state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov Gray Davis The state Public Utilities Commission in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governors power strategy is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the states power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices and it wants some of those prices cut The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if theyre not renegotiated Commissioner Richard Bilas said I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Its definitely not something thats a favorable thing to have happen to us said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources which negotiated the contracts Hidalgo said the long-term contracts even though more expensive than current market prices are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out Hidalgo said If thats the goal then were back to square one Prices would start to creep up The state is paying an average of 69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators Peak prices for electricity last week were less than 30 Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned 125 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases Over the past three months lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc Alliance Colton LLC Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp subsidiary said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher SEMPRA CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements some of which last 20 years In all California has committed to spending at least 43 billion for electricity The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the 1 billion contract one of Davis energy consultants owned stock in the power suppliers parent company Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldnt comment until it had studied the PUC submissions The PUCs challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governors three appointees The commission has rebuffed Davis attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned 125 billion bond issue STATE TREASURERS WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUCs actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a 9 billion hole in the state budget next year PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer We should not through the instrument of the bonds lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years Lynch said last week We should stay as flexible as possible Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commissions challenges to the contracts Commissioner Jeff Brown Lynchs fellow Davis appointee said the filings dont rule out Davis bond financing deal Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts he said But federal action could help the state improve the deals he said The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract he said Even if we renegotiate well renegotiate within the confines of the contract Hidalgo however said he doubted the state could modify the contracts Under power granted by the Legislature he said the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable Jan Mitchell a spokeswoman for ScottishPower parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations Now another California agency is disputing it Mitchell said We obviously disagree and well continue to work with FERC making sure the contracts are honored PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year 1 billion deal with the company July 6 That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts the PUC says News reports suggest that the water department paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers the PUC said An energy consultant to Davis Vikram Budhraja admitted in August that he owned as much as 10000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out Budhraja sold the stock July 30 and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the states energy picture While the issue has slipped from the public eye Davis solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edisons finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing While officials fight among themselves the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation

Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Karen Shea Max Bulk Subject IMPORTANT   Motion of San Diego Gas  Electric Company U 902-E for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or der Shortening Time Yesterday SDGE filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism  The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers  The utility requests a 15-day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 September 8 is a Satur day  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access  20 Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there  is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of  an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination20 As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That  stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct  access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of 2000 approximately 20 of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of 2001 direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1 Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly20 These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment  period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over 20kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least 5 years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the  use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of  over- or under-commitment20 In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch 20 Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a near-t erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan  20 The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role  20 When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fee s should also apply  20 There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings  Please let me and others know if you agree 20 Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass 5959 Topanga Canyon Blvd  Suite 244 Woodland Hills CA 91367 Tel   818 596-2201 Fax  818 346-6502

Scheduled Individual Ex Parte Communication Meeting As indicated by this ex parte notice Edison is planning to meet with Bilas this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access  Edisons comments on the proposed decision say that over 6 of their load has switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame resulting in a total of over 7 of load being served by direct access over their entire system at present  While it appears Bilas is still a strong proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options should Enron or AReM get in to see Bilas and possibly Brown to try to prevent any backsliding on the 13th  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas  A meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his advisor Dave Gamson I would recommend we try for both Mike Day

get the market California energy policy and Edison back on their feet Best Jeff FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO Updated Friday September 21 2001 0453 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market The states need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov Gray Davis who signed 43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators complaints The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement The letter was sent to the ISO the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators all of which were to attend the meeting Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine months are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and procedures ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market Wolfmans office said As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the second letter says The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays meeting Generators Confused Generators including Mirant Corp MIR

ISOs spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher Thats because according to the allegations the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as out-of-market purchases that arent averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISOs request DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs long-term contracts The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive however According to the ISOs August market report the average out-of-market price for peak hours was 5590 a megawatt-hour compared with 2649MWh on the ISO computerized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Calif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meeting isnt open to the public The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices Wolfman said in the letter -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjonescom

Jeff State fights 6000 firms energy deals Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer mailtobtanseysfchroniclecom Sunday September 2 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright URL httpwwwsfgatecomcgi-binarticlecgifilechroniclearchive20010902MN155174DTL Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers More than 6000 firms including big retail chains and industrial plants signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped State officials are incensed saying the private direct access contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California I think its wrong and its immoral Angelides said State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday The drafts were not consistent said Tracy Fairchild a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets a consortium of generators and energy suppliers Which one were we supposed to take seriously The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a 125 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for Californias emergency power purchases The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the states 1996 deregulation law Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power To make sure the states outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access By that time most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions But by July market prices had come down and energy providers like Enron Energy Services AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman Coleman said she helped five retail chains with a significant number of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer Business is business and if you can get a better price for something you should said Coleman who declined to name her clients She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down Daniel Douglass an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the states long- term power contracts You cant take advantage of the states stabilizing the rates then say Thank you very much and stick everyone else with the bill Angelides said State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6000 new direct access contracts in July alone A rough calculation suggests that as a result the firms might contribute as much as 64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale state officials said Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education health care and childrens services What theyre talking about doing he said is holding us hostage until they get what they want E-mail Bernadette Tansey at btanseysfchroniclecom mailtobtanseysfchroniclecom 2001 San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright Page

ECONOMIC SUMMIT In the wake of repeated economic blows on the states business community and announcements of losses layoffs and declining tax revenues the Governor has stated his intention to hold an Economic Summit in early November with business and labor leaders and professional economists to identify and discuss measures to stimulate Californias economy   The date and participants will be announced this week  Governor Davis is also considering the possibility of calling a Special Legislative Session to enact such measures immediately   In an effort to avoid or minimize a looming State budget deficit the Department of Finance has instructed state agencies to cut their budgets by 15 CMTAs members are devising a priority list of policies that should be adopted to help mitigate the

Financing Authority Power Authority meeting in San Francisco Chairman David Freeman acknowledged that renewable peaking capacity may comprise a significant portion of the 15 percent reserve the Authority expects to establish to prevent future price spikes in the cost of electricity Freeman indicated that the Authority has received proposals for 18000 MW in peaker capacity which have been evaluated and winnowed down to 3000 MW  While commitments to build these peaker facilities have not yet been formalized the Power Authority is moving forward with proposals for a few hundred renewable megawatts Freeman also indicated that at least two state biomass plants are at risk of shutting down  He believes that these plants should continue to run despite the high costs associated with this market  Power Authority staff has been asked to look at options to keep the plants operating and to report back to the Power Authority Board member Donald Vial expressed concern at the way in which the Power Authority is looking at the 15 percent reserve  He believes that the reserve should be a working capacity margin used to phase out dirty plants and to move into and to promote renewables Board member John Stevens pointed out that the Power Authority has limited funding with which to purchase peaking capacity and reminded the members that any plan must reasonably balance the costs associated with the generation capacity Department of Water Resources Update The Power Authority also received a report from staff of the Department of Water Resources DWR who indicated that the Department is looking at load curtailment renewables and new supplies that ideally are north of Path 15  The Department believes it has been instrumental in keeping the spot market under control and minimizing the number of blackouts experienced this summer  The Department also gave a great deal of credit to customers who have been instrumental in preventing blackouts through conservation The Department will be updating its energy portfolio needs and posting its information on its website at wwwcerswatercagov sometime next week Public Utilities Commission Natural Gas Infrastructure Report Barbara Hale the Director of Strategic Planning at the Public Utilities Commission PUC provided an update on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report that is due to the Power Authority by November 15  Ms Hale indicated that the PUC is working with the California Energy Commission CEC to evaluate the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure including interstate pipelines intrastate pipelines local distribution storage and backbone  The PUC fully expects to have the report finalized and ready to deliver to the Power Authority by November 15 Preliminary findings indicate that in-ground storage is at 85 percent of capacity a healthy margin to meet demands through the winter  While there still is room to inject additional natural gas the PUC is expecting a moderate winter with low gas demand Chairman Freeman requested that the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report also include a forecast of natural gas availability from the lower 48 states and Canada as well as whether or not California may depend on these sources to meet its needs Board Member Vial questioned if the unbundling of storage has been successful  Ms Hale replied that the PUC is monitoring non-core use and that preliminary findings indicate that many non-core customers are increasing their use of storage Activities Related to Renewable Energy and Conservation Staff at the Power Authority reported that coordination between the PUC and the Power Authority is necessary to optimize conservation energy efficiency and demand response  Specifically the Power Authority is putting together a residential loan program financing for efficiencies in public buildings and financing for small commercial and industrial upgrades  The Power Authority believes that the small commercial and industrial market is the most under-served due to the multiple demands on owners and their lack of resources  The Power Authority is looking at ways to assist these customers in retrofitting their facilities At the other end of the spectrum the Power Authority believes that large commercial and industrial customers require the least assistance  The Power Authority believes these customers are well served under current programs but acknowledged that many of the demand response programs would be better coordinated under the administration of just one agency Finally Board Member Vial questioned why there has been little emphasis on real time pricing  Power Authority staff agreed that real time pricing has not been a priority and that the infrastructure to implement a real time pricing program does not currently exist  Staff did indicate however that a recent 35 million investment in meters should help to incentivize these programs Freeman concluded that it is important for the Power Authority to build on the momentum of conservation and he acknowledged that technology finally is being priced such that real time pricing makes sense and likely will be an integral part of the Power Authoritys program Laura Doll Named as New Executive Director Laura Doll of Austin Texas was approved as the Chief Executive Officer of the Power Authority at the October 5 Board meeting  Most recently Doll was Director of Customer Service for Grande Communications  She also has held the positions of Senior Vice President for Planergy as well as Chief Administrative Officer for Austin Energy  Doll received a master of public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin and a bachelor of arts degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute  She will receive an annual salary of 200000 COMPUTER RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY BILL VETOED AGAIN Governor Davis vetoed SB 147 by Senator Debra Bowen D-Marina Del Rey on October 8  The bill would have required employers to prepare and distribute by hard copy or electronically a company monitoring policies and practices notice to each employee to collect and verify their understanding of the notice and file and maintain each employees signed notice indefinitely  This is the third time Senator Bowens notice bill has been vetoed by the Governor and we hope that the bill has struck out In his veto message the governor referred to some of the concerns expressed by employers such as the need to monitor and control the use of company property for business purposes  Also employers are potentially liable for the misuse of computers for improper purposes such as sexual harassment defamation and the like so employers have a legitimate reason to monitor e-mail and computer files from time to time The Governor said in closing his veto message  I support reasonable privacy protections for employees in the workplace and my Administration proposed amendments which would carry out the intent of the bill without imposing undue regulatory burdens and potential legal exposure to businesses for doing what any employee should assume is the employers right when they accept employment  Senator Bowen rejected the proposed amendments Thus I must veto the bill a third time This is a significant victory for employers  The bill had the potential to open up Pandoras box on employee notices in the workplace by greatly expanding the scope confirmation and tracking of notices  CMTA applauds the Governors veto of SB 147 GOVERNOR SIGNS MERCURY LEGISLATION Governor Davis has signed legislation to place new controls on products containing mercury  SB 633 by Senator Byron Sher D-Palo Alto places new controls on the disposal of appliance and vehicle components found to contain mercury I am signing this bill because it will help reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded thermometers novelty products and by mercury-containing electrical switches that are not removed before junked vehicles are crushed or shredded said Davis SB 633 also bans the sale of new automobiles in California after January 1 2005 that contain mercury electrical switches LATE BREAKING NEWS SB 71 Burton

Landwehr Susan M Palmer Mark A PR Subject	It seems to be unraveling for Davis--Need Ron or Dan to get CPUC Filings at FERC FYI Split between Davis and Lynch is now very public  Davis is likely losing his mind  Can Ron Carroll or Dan Watkiss search these filings down at FERC  Thanks Best Jeff State PUC seeks to void Daviss power contracts Deals gouge consumers agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine Californias hard-won control of the power market state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov Gray Davis The state Public Utilities Commission in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governors power strategy is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the states power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices and it wants some of those prices cut The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if theyre not renegotiated Commissioner Richard Bilas said I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Its definitely not something thats a favorable thing to have happen to us said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources which negotiated the contracts Hidalgo said the long-term contracts even though more expensive than current market prices are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out Hidalgo said If thats the goal then were back to square one Prices would start to creep up The state is paying an average of 69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators Peak prices for electricity last week were less than 30 Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned 125 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases Over the past three months lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc Alliance Colton LLC Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp subsidiary said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher SEMPRA CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements some of which last 20 years In all California has committed to spending at least 43 billion for electricity The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the 1 billion contract one of Davis energy consultants owned stock in the power suppliers parent company Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldnt comment until it had studied the PUC submissions The PUCs challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governors three appointees The commission has rebuffed Davis attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned 125 billion bond issue STATE TREASURERS WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUCs actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a 9 billion hole in the state budget next year PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer We should not through the instrument of the bonds lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years Lynch said last week We should stay as flexible as possible Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commissions challenges to the contracts Commissioner Jeff Brown Lynchs fellow Davis appointee said the filings dont rule out Davis bond financing deal Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts he said But federal action could help the state improve the deals he said The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract he said Even if we renegotiate well renegotiate within the confines of the contract Hidalgo however said he doubted the state could modify the contracts Under power granted by the Legislature he said the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable Jan Mitchell a spokeswoman for ScottishPower parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations Now another California agency is disputing it Mitchell said We obviously disagree and well continue to work with FERC making sure the contracts are honored PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year 1 billion deal with the company July 6 That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts the PUC says News reports suggest that the water department paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers the PUC said An energy consultant to Davis Vikram Budhraja admitted in August that he owned as much as 10000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out Budhraja sold the stock July 30 and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the states energy picture While the issue has slipped from the public eye Davis solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edisons finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing While officials fight among themselves the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation

find out  Im of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides so that his wild assertions dont go unanswered in the court of public opinion  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides instead On the other hand I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools processes etc necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand and ensure that theres not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other  In the publics view this has been painted as an eitheror issue Either we end direct access or granny faces death and destruction  And thats just not the case In fact I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isnt in the cards

even the mighty and powerful Power Authoritys own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short despite DWR contracts and DA stampede which should leave one to believe that contrary to Angelides letter the more the DA the better Which further supports Loretta Lynchs response to the Angelides letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy Best Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority Power Authority was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources DWR rate agreement stalemate has been resolved Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commissions rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts to contract for peaker generation andor to implement demand side programs The Power Authority relies upon DWRs credit to fund these programs and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley as well as 400 MW generated by wind With the Current Glut of Contracts Why Do We Need Additional Reserves Kellan Flukinger Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing conservation interruptibles demand side management renewables and peakers Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer William Barry was approved as Chief

the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County During the period that roughly coincides with the El PasoEl Paso Merchant contract SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large volumes of storage gas from those fields said Langdon The state commission finally granted the requests in June 2001 the month after termination of the contract he related Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso Canyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100000 Dtday of deliverability to the California gas market without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity said Langdon Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network he stressed that storage is huge in moderating the market When pipeline capacity is constrained storage is a way to take care of    these problems And yet the SoCal Gas applications clearly languished at the CPUC There may be very good reasons why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas but so far I dont understand how the CPUC sits on a storage application like that during this time period when its as significant as it is For its part the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its feet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project IF 14 May 5 Im trying not to sound like an advocate in this thing said Langdon but I dont understand the CPUCs position in the case    when right in their own back yard theyve got these storage issues As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the contract and subsequently withheld massive amounts of capacity from the market weve reached the conclusion that we dont see that kind of evidence in whats been presented so far in the proceeding said Langdon His team of lawyers is looking closely at the maze of engineering issues that could hold the answer to the capacity withholding issue Langdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving energy market Order 497 the marketing-affiliate rule was first promulgated in 1986 he noted In most industries such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace But here the gas industry has been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of and yet these rules are the very same ones that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years They absolutely need to be updated end of sentence end of paragraph said Langdon Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr about the strength of the El Paso case Langdon said he was not at all concerned about the company not getting a fair shake at the commission Much of what Wagner had to say has been sensationalized to a degree in the press he said adding that what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are two different things Langdon admitted that he would be a little concerned about Wagners remarks if I were litigating the case The judge has used some pretty strong language to suggest that the El Paso companies were out of line But FERC historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal and in this case the record looks very sound he said -

Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language too Im proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill  I would appreciate your feedback  The amendments would be as follows Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power Jan 17th and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes should be exempt from paying for the bonds In short customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP and once from DWR  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldnt be fair to require them to pay for it Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed no more and no less For example if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan 17th thru April 30th I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks  Or if we didnt explicitly agree during the talks they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now And rather than leave the issue hanging which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers obligations are  Your thoughts are appreciated In addition we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in  Providing 20KW and above customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1 reduce the net short position that the state and ultimately consumers have to finance thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility  2 reduce electricity purchasing costs and 3 reduce the burden on the state budget With this in mind Im also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st Finally it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill  If a dedicated rate component is created that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access  And if thats the case would it make sense to delete that language from the bill Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the corenoncore proposal Best Jeff This e-mail is intended solely for use of the individual to whom it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged confidential or otherwise exempt from

California energy policy and Edison back on their feet Best Jeff FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO20 Updated Friday September 21 2001 0453 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JON ES NEWSWIRES20 LOS ANGELES Dow Jones--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether  the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipula ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state  purchased under long-term contracts according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday20 At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market The s tates need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro ven embarrassing for Gov Gray Davis who signed 43 billion in deals to he ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized20 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California  Monday to address generators complaints The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out  of line with the market according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement20 The letter was sent to the ISO the California Department of Water Resource s - which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators all of which were to attend th e meeting20 Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu res of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine mont hs are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st ructure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to dev elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and pr ocedures20 ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC20 The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines wh ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from 20 If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an au dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated  the market Wolfmans office said20 As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud it of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement  division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could  lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated20 The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po wer first20 The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe r at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the  second letter says20 The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and decl ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays me eting20 Generators Confused20 Generators including Mirant Corp MIR

in the ISOs spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher Thats because according to the allegations the I SO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as out-of-market purchases that arent averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p articipants see20 DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISOs request DW R operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs long-term contracts20 The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive however According to t he ISOs August market report the average out-of-market price for peak hou rs was 5590 a megawatt-hour compared with 2649MWh on the ISO computer ized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th e out-of-market prices for months20 None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record20 The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Ca lif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meet ing isnt open to the public20 The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and  operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro ve the market20 The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to  by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra ctices Wolfman said in the letter20 -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires

Integrated Resource Planning Importance High The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been discussing the prospects of state agencies eg the CEC pursuing a long-term 1-2 year strategy of re-introducing centralized Integrated Resource Planning in California  Indeed some CEC staff have used sought to obtain planningmodelling authorities that could lead to dispatch instructions or perhaps identification of generation units for retirement The CPUC is opening a rulemaking OIR to return to integrated resource planning  The BRPU returns  Anyway we will be discussing this further at the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes available -----Original Message-----From Andy Brown mailtoabbeslawfirmcom Sent Thursday October 25 2001 1036 AM To Steven Kelly doug kerner Jan Smutny-Jones Subject highlights from CPUC meeting Importance High FYI  Highlights from todays CPUC meeting  It is still in progress with few energy items remaining  Regular results memo to follow CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to integrated resource planning with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update BRPU proceeding  Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options including new asset construction power purchase agreements conservation transmission etc CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes lines to NV AZ and MX  Will begin new phase re economic projects CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge ALJ ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts  CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes but that they must move forward on ordinary review process  This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCEs CPUC rejects PGEs call for market valuation of retained generation PGE argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates  CPUC rejects argument  Duque will concur but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets and fact that PGE still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation  It is also unclear notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement --Andrew Brown Sacramento CA andybrwnearthlinknet

directed by the man who heads the states energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter the president of the Independent System Operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge Winter defied his own board and Gov Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps records and interviews show I dont know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said Dunn The subpoenas will force those involved including Winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over e-mails personal calendars and memos Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of Winter The governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis Maviglio said Winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunns committee will find no criminal conduct The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on At the time generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps It was an emergency Fishman said We had to take action What became known as the palace coup began on Oct 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power The restrictions would drive prices as low as 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier They electricity generators grinned and beared the 750 price cap but this new plan by ISO was too much said Dunn whose committee has been investigating since March All hell broke loose Records show that on Oct 31 power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission demanding that the new plan be killed The letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators If not removed immediately the ISO price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws In the Oct 31 letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps werent removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market The generators got their way The next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan What was left in place was a 250 price cap established five months earlier Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldnt make a profit even under these constraints They began to withhold power from California and on Dec 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis Winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO submitted a 50-page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the 250 price cap Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government Neither the ISO board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of Winters actions until the cap had been removed In fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request Charles Robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made He didnt mention anything about it In retrospect we should have told them Robinson said With the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governors key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment Maviglio said It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant This action accelerated the utilities move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business Prices for electricity jumped from an average of 249 a megawatt to 700 a megawatt within three days ISO records show Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded 30 billion Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians Prices he said did not spike as a result Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern Robinson said In our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund Jan Smutney-Jones who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted Terry did this by himself said Smutney-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions Some board members pushed to have Winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governors spokesman Maviglio said James J Hoecker the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman defended making the December decision and also defended Winter They filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let California go dark Hoecker said They ISO management did what any independent system operator would do What Dunns committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winters Dec 8 actions should provide vital clues We dont know why he did what he did but we are eager to find out Dunn said Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians but I find that argument has no basis in fact

ASSOCIATED IOU RATE  SCHEDULES FOR LACK OF PROPER NOTICE UNDER THE FPA  Pursuant to Rules 212 of the Rules and Practices and Procedures of the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC 18 CFR 385212  CAlifornians for Renewable Energy Inc CARE moves for the  Commissions consideration and action to remedy the illegal execution of  long-term energy contracts by the California Department of Water Resources  DWR in regards to the CARE and other partys complaints in EL00-95  etal Under section 205c of the Federal Power Act 49 Stat 851 16  USC 824dc the DWR long-term energy contracts recently disclosed  through legal action by the California legislature and press requires that  these contracts shall be tendered for filing with the Commission and  posted not less than sixty days nor more than one hundred-twenty days  prior to the date on which the electric service is to commence We  contend that DWR has failed to comply with the requirements of the FPA in  this matter The remedy CARE seeks is for the Commission to issue an Order  or Stay canceling or suspending such long-term energy contracts and  associated IOU rate schedules yet to be submitted to the Commission  pursuant to FPA section 205 c  DWR disputes its requirements to provide proper notice prior to execution  of said long-term contracts to all the parties to this case and to the  public who have in a statutory and constitutional right to comment on  expenditures of the publics funds in this manner by DWR In response to  CAREs CPRA request DWR  states the Departments purchases and sales of  power are exempt from the Federal Power Act because DWR is a state agency  Section 201f To the extent that the Department engages in purchases or  sales with counterparties who are subject to Federal Power Act  jurisdiction any obligation to file with FERC or otherwise comply with  the Act lies with the counterparty to the contract and not the  department  CARE contends that DWR is acting as an designated representative for the  Investor Owned Utilities IOUs in the purchase of energy in California  pursuant to 18 CFR 351 a without authorization by the Commission        In cases where two or more public utilities are required to file  rate schedules or certificates of concurrence such public utilities may  authorize a designated representative to file upon behalf of all parties  if upon written request such parties have been granted Commission  authorization therefore  CARE contends these actions by DWR violated the requirements of 18 CFR  351 4e        No public utility shall directly or indirectly demand charge  collect or receive any rate charge or compensation for or in connection  with electric service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or  impose any classification practice rule regulation or contract with  respect thereto which is different from that provided in a rate schedule  required to be on file with this Commission unless otherwise specifically  provided by order of the Commission for good cause shown  CARE contends that ample evidence of DWRs acting as the California IOUs  designated representative is provided by DWRs request to the California  Public Utilities Commission PUC for a Revised Revenue Requirement and  Power Purchase Costs Pursuant to Water Code Section 80110 and Public  Utilities Code Section 451  which is further illustrated by the PUCs  Administrative law Judges Ruling on the August 7 2001 Revenue  Requirement of the DWR regarding the IOU SDG  E applications  01-10-044 and 01-01-0045 to the PUC  which states        SDGE shall present alternative calculations of the required system  average rate increases that 1 collect the DWR-related rate increases  over the remaining 5 quarters of the revenue requirement period set forth  in Table A-6 ie the fourth quarter of 2001 and the four quarters of  2002 2 collect the DWR-related rate increases over the next 8 quarters  ie the fourth quarter of 2001 the four quarters of 2002 and the  first three quarters of 2003 and 3 collect the DWR-related rate  increases over the  period from September 1 2001 through December 31  2002  Clearly it is the intent of the DWR to act as the IOUs designated  representative to seek approval from the PUC to collect the DWR-related  rate increases  CARE reiterates it is the public policy that public agencies exist to aid  in the conduct of the peoples business and that the proceedings of public  agencies be conducted openly so that the public may remain informed It is  the intent of the law that actions of public agencies be taken openly and  that their deliberation be conducted openly The people do not yield their  sovereignty to those agencies that serve them  The people in delegating  authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is  good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know  The  people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over  the instruments they have created DWR has breached its public duties by  failing to provide for myself CARE its members and other members of the  public our statutory and constitutional right to comment or protest these  long-term energy contracts executed by DWR the associated expenditures of  the publics funds and associated rate increases to California energy  consumers  In conclusion the Remedy CARE seeks
