Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.

Best,

Jeff,
John White has proposed to the CEERT Board that we send the attached letter to the Governor attacking the DWR contracts. Would you please take a look at it and let me know what you think of it.  You can reach me on my cell phone at 213-359-0853. Thanks.

You're just aiming to pick a fight w/ Freeman!!  One point I would really hit home after saying that an inexperienced buyer, DWR, was buying power for the state, is that the amount of debt incurred by the state -- that will now have to be burdened by ALL residents -- has thrown California into financial peril, depleting reserves, taking $$ away from education, etc., for at least the next two decades.

You around today?  I still need to talk to you.

Subject:	Participation in Roundtable on Lessons Learned in California on October 4th

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Hi Jeff:
 
1.    Don't know at this point what if anything we'll do.  We haven't, as you undoubtedly seen, taken a lead on DA issues.  We do, however, have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be. More when that develops.
 
2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.  He typically works with the QFs who have contracts to sell power; I work more on the consumer side with the QFs who build primarily to self-serve.    (In other words, he looks more a power generation, I look more at end-user issues.)  Certainly feel free to call him.  He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe he'll be here tomorrow.
 
Hope you're safe and well.

Hi Evie:
 
Two quick things:
 
1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?
 
2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.
 
Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.
 
Best,
Jeff

=09=09=09As you may know, at Jim's request, Stacey Bolton reviewed the rene=
wables language in SBX2 79 and SB 532 and identified some important issues.=
=20

=09=09=09In a memo she sent out yesterday, she detailed her concerns about =
these bills (copied below, for your reference). =20

=09=09=09How do you suggest we proceed?  Shall I arrange a brief call for u=
s with Stacey, Elliot, Mary and Jesse to discuss where we stand and strateg=
y going forward?

=09=09=09Jennifer =20

=09=09=09***************
=09=09=09Overall Concerns: =20
=09=09=09=091.=09The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilat=
eral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid p=
resents limitations and could drive up costs.
=09=09=09=092.=09It's unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from =
the underlying commodity.  The above requirement indicates that it is not. =
 This would negatively impact, and even negate the main reasons to have a R=
EC trading program - to provide flexibility and act as verification for the=
 RPS.
=09=09=09=093.=09The biomass definition is too limiting.  Would be difficul=
t to detail this amount of information on a REC.  Need to have language tha=
t distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not.
=09=09=09=094.=09Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed lan=
guage in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Departm=
ent of Water Resources (SB 532 only) is instructed to purchase renewables o=
n their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities.
=09=09=09=095.=09While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective, =
it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the ren=
ewable premiums for new sources.

=09=09=09=09=09The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard =
and voted on
=09=09=09=09=09amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  =
Some passed,
=09=09=09=09=09some failed and most of them served to further confuse the c=

=09=09=09=09=09TURN and other consumer groups.

=09=09=09=09=09During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nanc=

=09=09=09=09=09Richard Katz from the Governor's office regarding a couple o=

Subsequently,
=09=09=09=09=09Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff's request.  D.J. agre=
ed that the bill
=09=09=09=09=09needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for =

=09=09=09=09=09amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be le=
ss likely to
=09=09=09=09=09believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be =
too
=09=09=09=09=09self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg =
on direct
=09=09=09=09=09access.  We suggested that "shall" be changed to "may" in or=

=09=09=09=09=09leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn't ne=
cessarily oppose
=09=09=09=09=09the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unle=
ss you can
=09=09=09=09=09totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).

=09=09=09=09=09A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are=
 prepared to
=09=09=09=09=09push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian governm=
ent) if this
=09=09=09=09=09bill passes.

=09=09=09=09=09There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the=

=09=09=09=09=09The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30=

Hi Jeff,

Hope you are doing well. Got your email from Scott. I'm hoping you can
do me a favor.  We are doing a  research project for a client and are
trying to identify key technical management at a variety of companies,
including Enron.

Specifically, we are looking for names and addresses of the following:

CIO/CTO
VP, Directors and/or Sr. Managers responsible for the company's
network.  They'll typically have titles like VP of Network Operations
and Senior Network Architect.

Any chance you can get me this info for Enron? I'd be forever in your
debt.

thanks,

 kent

USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said. 
But there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. 
According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. 
"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. 
Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. 
The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. 
"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. 
CALIFORNIA CAVEAT 
Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . 
But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. 
"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. 
More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. 
Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. 
With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade. 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel. 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .

Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets 



(Published Oct. 7, 2001) 

A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. 

Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. 

Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. 

Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. 

The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. 

Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. 

How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. 

However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. 

It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. 

The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.

The Commission also delayed a decision on whether contract renewal will be included under the suspension.

Subject:	PUC Votes to Suspend Direct Access  Effective September 20th, But Continues to Hold Out Threat of Retroactivity

The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

Best,
Jeff

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.

  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, 	and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Key risks associated with each category:
Adverse to P/L 
Adverse to hedge (demand risk)

FYI.  See highlighted comments below.  Don't know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about Davis trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order.  How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch & Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds.  Perhaps Davis is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally.  In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is "doable," but they ain't giving any details.  We're trying to find out more.
Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings 
Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. 
The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. 
At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. 
Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. 
The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. 
Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. 
Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. 
Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. 
In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. 
Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. 
"There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. 
SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. 
A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. 
Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. 
Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." 
The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. 
"If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. 
She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

The generators are going to go nuts over this.  They'll do all the pounding needed on their own.  Calpine will likely lead the charge, which should be interesting....

I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?

I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.

Subject: CPUC Initiating Rulemaking on "Integrated Resource Planning"
Importance: High


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
"retirement."

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to "integrated resource
planning."  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting
Importance: High


FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to "integrated resource planning"
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

GOVERNOR MAKES STATEMENT ON PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ACTIONS 10/2/2001


SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis today made the following statement regarding PUC
actions:

"I applaud the mutual efforts of the California Public Utilities Commission
and Southern California Edison. Their settlement has protected the public
interest, and will allow the State's second largest utility to return to
financial health. I am pleased to hear the PUC's assurance that this can be
accomplished without a rate hike.

"In light of the agreement between the PUC and Edison, there is no need for
the Legislature to return next week for a special session. Therefore, I am
rescinding my call for the Third Extraordinary Session.

"In January, the Legislature passed AB 1X which authorized the State to
purchase power since our two largest utilities were brought to their
financial knees by runaway wholesale energy costs. Despite long odds, the
State was able to keep the lights on this summer and has spent approximately
$6.1 billion from the General Fund and $5 billion from the DWR Power Fund
doing so. AB 1X envisioned the sale of revenue bonds to repay the General
Fund with interest.

"The Public Utilities Commission's refusal today to adopt the rate agreement
necessary for the bonds to be sold was an irresponsible act. It creates
uncertainty about our ability to sell the bonds necessary to repay the
General Fund when California can least afford additional fiscal uncertainty.
In fact, preliminary financial estimates show that State revenues are $1.1
billion short of budget projections.

Greetings.  Hope, given the circumstances, that you're well.  I'm trying to get a hold of Mark Baldwin, and the number I have gets a recording saying that it ain't the number anymore.  Do you have a number for him.  Greatly appreciated.

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Sandra

California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. 
Davis `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''

Retroactivity (July 1)
No contract renewal
No incremental "DASR'ing", i.e., adding/subtracting load on the margin (fast food chains, for example)
Cost allocation risk (e.g., IOU undercollection, bonds, DWR undercollection gets distributed to DA customers)


Before providing elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a complete list of the key risk areas.  Please add to/subtract from this list, and then I'll take a shot at fleshing it out.

Does it make sense to have a quick call (15-30 minutes) just to update you on the status of Edison/PG&E talks, what's going on at the PUC, etc.?  Let me know.  Today looks pretty good for me to try to do it.

This looks like we are going to be in a long pissing match with Edison.  It would be very helpful to know what our position is with DA customers before Cal Push 1 and Cal Push 2 going forward.  I know that this is probably a pain, but it seems like that's information that we need to know.  Also, it appears that Edison is under the opinion that we were short a call option to them during the ctc recovery period.  Edison gets to keep positive ctc's while they get to recover negative ctc's from esp's.

jeff d., what does edison say to the point that they got to keep positive ctc's and are now attempting to amortize negative ctc's?

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Things are ok but not very.  When do you want the wine?  I could get the
Coastal right away, but I just ordered the 97 cab this morning and we are
only allowed 12 bottles at a time.

I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that:

1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and,
2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.

Could I get your fax numbers?  Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.  Thanks.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

Yes.  I called him yesterday after the call and filled him in on all the details. So he's up to speed; but feel free to forward.
Best,
Jeff

Also, didn't want to put in the note, but I got the impression from Fielder that he's not real keen on extending the stipulation.  But I think we should push it, if for no other reason than to keep the PUC out of it.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. 
Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. 
The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. 
The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. 
The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. 
It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. 
EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM 
One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. 
Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. 
The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. 
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. 
Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. 
Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 
'FIRE SALE PRICES' 
"PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. 
"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. 
Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. 
PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. 
The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. 
They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. 
The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. 
SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.

This looks very good.  One suggestion:  May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.  May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).  Just a suggestion.  I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.  Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.

That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).

Best,
Jeff

I invited Jim S.

I was assuming that Paul would facilitate.  Paul can you make this meeting? If not Paul, I was assuming it would be Sue or you.

Here's my  suggested Agenda

1. Clarify scope of meeting.  Calif. coverage or the entire West?

2. GA staff goes down the list of key cases that affect the curve (T, D, and utility G) and identifies who's covering cases

3. URM gives feedback on areas of their curves that may not be in GA's "radar"

4. Discussion over which cases should be monitoring mode and which we should be advocating a position.

It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get an amendment here.

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply "to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."  I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to either 

1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, or 
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing requirements.

The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can give you some specific language.)

Hedy or Scott - could you please call me when you get in - 713 853-5786.  Thanks.

Steve:

Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.

Best,
Jeff

>
> ``The California crisis, while not desired, has been a tremendous

>
> The long-term contracts have an average ``spark spread,'' or the

BN  18:06 Talks Between California, Generators End; No Accord (Correct)

(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to

result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph

and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)

 

     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two

weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power

sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states

recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold

hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.

     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two

sides no closer to an accord.

     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,
FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far

apart.''

      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because

the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are

also requesting money.

     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California

during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of

calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks

offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from

generators to $716 million.

      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how

the state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by

California's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said

Wagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should

be paid.

     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and

should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price

caps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest

priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.

      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,

Wagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a

refund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from

that time period.

     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's

recommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would

give his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and

California will sue to get the rest, he said.

     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without

releasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.

     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,

though they agreed the state asked for too much.

    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to

justify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because

we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in

question,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of

the power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows

how ridiculous this is.''

    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund

$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.

     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a

settlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting

blame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''

     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's

recommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general

counsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes

problems with California's methodology for calculating the

refunds, he said.

      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14

billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when

the state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The

state began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and

has spent close to $8 billion.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Could you make sure that whomever's doing the letter to the California Ds gets a copy to me and Sue (want to keep the family happy, don't you know).

Thanks a million.

Boy do we need the cash from that merger.  Please hurry.

Forgive me.  Can't recall if I already responded. Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.

Jeff,

My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of
the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California,
including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
Any ideas?

Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated
them.

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. 
"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Subject:	Implementation of the Suspension Direct Access -- UDCs' Plan

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.


7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change, modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it. 

Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?

Subject: Davis devises new borrowing plan 


Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and
bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the
long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California
state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy
crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as
next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator,
the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it
declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in
place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the
repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining
issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday
when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different
scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be
publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell
$12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would
go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a
mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before
they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and
cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from
ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove
inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to
the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the
department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole
responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that
authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its
president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure
investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would
be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers'
utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect,
guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with
paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe
that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest
negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an
executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate
agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"
Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the
PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of
those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his
expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the
payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by
Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in
getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies'
contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis
believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next
year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by
some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion
shortfall in other income.

Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International. 
"We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." 
Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. 
Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. 
The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. 
Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. 
"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." 
Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. 
Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." 
"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," Bryson said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." 
Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate. 
     
Stephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. 
Bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt. 
The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. 
"In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. 
The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. 
Bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC. 
     
Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. 
The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said. 
The end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.

It was good to see you.  No thanks needed.  I'm pretty sure that I can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and I'm fairly certain that we have that analysis.  How'd the meeting with PG&E go?  You get back to Houston OK?

Best,

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

It seems that since we've already contributed, we're invited.  Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent announcement and potential, and the fact that the Rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances (save for Morrow, who we may want to bring up with Brulte if the lunch is attended, this could be a useful gathering.  And it doesn't require crossing the border into California, to boot.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is an invitation letter from Reliant's CEO Steve Letbetter to the
CEO and President's of your company/energy client.

Jim Brulte and Dave Cox asked Reliant to host a lunch for them with energy
industry executives in Houston and we will be doing do on October 29th.
Jim and Dave will be making follow up calls to the principals.  I wanted
you each to know this was happening and see the invitation.  The financial
commitment is attached to attending the lunch but the pitch will be made to
support the Senate/Assembly Leadership account at the CA Republican Party.

This invitation is only going to energy industry executives, although there
is a possibility a few other Texas companies might be included.

Expect a call from Jeff Miller encouraging you to support attending when
asked by your client/company.

Hope to see you in Houston on the 29th.

Sadler

Subject: CRITICAL!! IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED 


THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY
WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.
 
The cover letter states as follows:  
 
"This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several
ways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from
September 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,
2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed
direct access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power
from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.
Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. 
 
Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires
that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no
longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated
electricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine the
effective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm
to customers and to resolve potential conflict, parties should comment on:
(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including all
transactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1X
if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,
2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriate
date for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.
Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for
those who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September
4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date."
 
The specific wording in the Decision is:
 
"The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until
DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should
be suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;
and the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest of
providing cost stability for current direct access customers, written
contracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from the
suspension for the initial term of the contracts."
 
It also provides that:

"In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need for
the Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as
soon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to the
parties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice that
direct access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commission
postponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do not
change the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation was
introduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February
1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants have
now had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wish
to reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 in
the hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this
switch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service
from the utility." 

The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues
which would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,
disposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.  I presume we will want to file in
strong opposition.  Suggestions on strategy?  It might be a good idea to
have a conference call on this and get started immediately with raising a
movement to counter this.

darling boy-

i'm never mad at you, never ever, and i really do adore you to death and
forever and can't bear the idea that we wouldn't be friends till death do us
part, and that i wouldn't be welcome in your life, so no, i was never mad
and don't even remember which of my (many) soliloquoys you may have
interrupted or are referring to but i do know that i have a rather
boisterous personality and perhaps i stepped on your toes and this is not my
intention and i adore you and my company is about to go under so the idea of
being unemployed AND having you upset with me is far too much for my

I prepared these bullet points for AReM based on an e-mail Dan Douglass sent questioning the constitutionality of the CPUC's action.  AReM's PR firm will turn this into a hand out.  Jeanne is getting back to me on the legal arguments.

Hi Barry:

Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. 

I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.

With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.

Thanks for your time and hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Regulatory Risks Tied to DA in California


Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.

FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.

Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. 

Best,
Jeff
  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

5.	[Added 10.01.01] Retroactive end to rate freeze: The utilities assert that the rate freeze ended as far back as May 2000 and 	have sued the PUC in court, asking the court to direct the PUC to end it.

Additional suggestions from Mike Day:

5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may put at risk [Dasovich, Jeff]   ontracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.

6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.

Thanks.  I have to clear with Calger first.  Also left a message with Kean re: same.  May be that we give the idea to the large customers and they run with it so no fingerprints on our part.  I'm going to sketch out a proposal and pass it around for people to swipe at.  I'm for severing IF Riordan loses (you think he can win?).

You going to the Astros/Giants game tonite.  Hopefully they'll actually throw a strike to Bonds tonite.

The writer fails of course to mention that Clinton (with bi-partisan support) bombed the shit out of bin laden after the embassy attacks.  Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that  the families of the victims are thinking about at this time. 
 
Best,
Jeff

Today, Dress Wounds.  Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)
by Michael Rectenwald


<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>
 
 
At this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the
heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in
need, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the
immediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to
address, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and
spiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all
suffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let
us suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of
our fellow human beings.

Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both
have arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding
members, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.
Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had "arms, legs,
and parts of people falling on our heads." Our nation is poorer, our lives
are lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.

We who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find
ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally
behind a leader who we know is not our leader, a "leader" who has, we
believe, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our
nation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger
towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --
unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --
is justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and
abroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault
on our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst
act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.
We do not think that this attack under Bush's "command" represents a
meaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that
"inescapable web of mutuality" that Martin Luther King referred to. There
was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative
consequences in and for the world.

The Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to
the ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been
exacerbated by the "laissez faire" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that
Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship
the situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,
the world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's
international policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and
treaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at
the present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address
a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable
pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.
Let's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to
those nearest us.

Therefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some
restraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at
the ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.
Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not
help either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and
alienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered
from this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe
harbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate "captain."   Our
commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a
deeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will
then be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the
right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best
interests of our nation at heart.

Let us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our
own, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too
much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.

Sincerely, 
 
 
Michael Rectenwald

Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)
2001-09-21 16:39 (New York)

Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)

     (Adds company comment in seventh paragraph.)

     Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the
largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic
trading system.

     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source
LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May
2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified
Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''

     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its Internet-based
electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.
17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.

     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing
the patent, and is asking for damages.

     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in
November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685
billion, the company has said.

     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,
paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on
revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.

     ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,''
said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.

     Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Direct Access Petition


Attached please find the draft Petition for Writ of Review before the California Supreme Court.  We are currently working on the Memorandum of Points and Authorities and anticipate sending a draft sometime tomorrow morning.  The Petition is based on the assumption that the Commission will adopt an order with retroactive application.  If the Commissions issues an Order consistent with the draft Interim Decision published today, then retroactivity will not be an issue and there wll be no need to seek judicial relief (at least on that ground). 
 
Enron Energy Services, Inc., is named as the Petitioner.  I am uncertain, however, whether this is the correct name or entity.
 
The Petition must be filed in the Supreme Court because the Legislature conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction on it when Public Utilities Code section 1768 was enacted.  The Petition does not  address the timeliness of the request for Supreme Court review.  Generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a Petition is timely and Section 1768 appears to require that an application for rehearing be denied before a Petition can be filed.  Since there will undoubtedly be an argument that the Petition is premature because there has been no application for a rehearing, the Points and Authorities (and probably the Petition) will discuss the timeliness of the Petition.  The exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine should control making the Petition timely.
 
Dan Douglass and I will be available for your 1 p.m. conference call.  If you need to reach me at any time my office number is (818) 596-2291, my cell number is (805) 796-2198, and my Email address is eduncan2@arterhadden.com <mailto:eduncan2@arterhadden.com>.  EWD

Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,
Jeff

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

Do we need to disucss this further?  I'd like to explore the Ose angle especially in light of the press interest.

Pat, you think Ose would run with this? Seems like potentially explosive stuff.

Since Congressman's Ose's been asking FERC alot of questons about what the ISO, DWR, etc. have been up to, perhaps he could write a "Dear FERC" letter saying "here's what I'm hearing, it sounds serious and you need to investigate, pronto, and get back to me ASAP with your conclusions."

Subject:        As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts

Everyone, 

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito: 

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 

9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at 
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about 
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this 
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it 
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time. 

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the 
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being 
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts 
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have 
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to 
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I 
have understood this correctly. 

Thanks a lot for your assistance. 

Caroline

10.  Here is an e-mail from the intrepid and vigilant Kit Blair, in Volume Management, who first brought this scam to my attention.

Subject:        487 Revelation 

Steve, 
        Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Status of CPUC Proposed Decisions on Direct Access Suspension


Jeff:

At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program.  There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is
the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01,
the day before the last meeting.  This version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6)
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically
naming that date.  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.  The other item,
Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.

Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on
Sept. 20.  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the
Commission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to
support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under Commission procedures.

Please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject.

I talked to Loretta today. She is pleased with the business support for SB 18x, but wants to see similar effort for the PUC members. She said the Bilas alternate doesn't work, and that the votes need to be rallied to defeating the rate agreement. 
 
Peace, vjw

Calif PUC Postpones Vote On CDWR Rev Requirement




LOS ANGELES -- The California Public Utilities Commission has postponed until after Sept. 11 a vote to establish how much revenue the California Department of Water Resources will receive for power purchases through 2002, a spokeswoman said.

The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities since January. The CPUC decision would establish how much the CDWR could recover through rates from each utility for those power buys.

The proposed decision, originally scheduled for a vote Thursday, was made available for the first time Tuesday night. The vote on the proposal was postponed in order to allow time for parties to file comments, which are due by 5 p.m. Sept. 11.

A new date for a vote hasn't been set, but will occur "some time after comments are received," the CPUC said in a press release.

Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.  Ain't getting any prettier.

Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting Summary
Importance:	High

Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can "heal its wounds." 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:

Alan Comnes


The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Prentice and Jeff - here's the address for the place just north of Point Reyes Station.  Looks sorta groovy, nice separate bedroom accommodations, central living area and good kitchen.  Let us know what you think....  it's not on the water, but the price is right and we're inclined to go for it.

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.
From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."

Despite the personal pleasure that I would derive from seeing Glynn and Richard strike out big time, it's not worth the price to ratepayers of letting these pirates (yes, pirates!) rip off so many valuable assets that should stay under PUC regulation for the benefit of consumers.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Subject: Status of CPUC Proposed Decisions on Direct Access Suspension


Jeff:

At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program.  There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is
the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01,
the day before the last meeting.  This version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6)
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically
naming that date.  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.  The other item,
Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.

Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on
Sept. 20.  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the
Commission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to
support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under Commission procedures.

Please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject.

Subject:	Dissent from Commissioners Bilas and Duque Opposing Suspension of DA



 Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

For what it's worth, I concur with Mike.  Option 3 is the most prudent, and preferable, path.

Subject:	Extensions of CA Deals

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly.

We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June.  Understanding that "new" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  

The 3 choices I see are:

1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.
2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.
3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.

It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.

The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.  MDS

My apologies for the delay.  About three other bonfires cropped up after I talked to you.  In any case, the answer to your question, is yes, we can switch our customers to dual billing if we choose to do so.  If you have any other questions, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Well, that's not helpful. Won't make things any easier.  Are they an ARM member?

I'll let the large customer groups know.

New West has indeed adopted SCE's position hook-line-and-sinker.  I left Janie a very pointed e-mail on this topic.  They have no customers receiving commodity from them, so, I guess, in the short term, they are not harmed.  It is, noehteless, an unprincipled position.  A key quote from the filing:

"It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission."

 What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks, Scott.  Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan, centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small.  Richmond (Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with  Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles between Rs and Ds.  In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.  Scott, are they meeting again on  Monday, or Tuesday?

Best,
Jeff

Subject: SBX2 78 HEARING CANCELED


The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing mid-way
through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before, with
the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats crafted
11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner their
votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or leadership
on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.

Commentary
Even Pacifists Must
Support This War

By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."

Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.

Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.

I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.
But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.

It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.

Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.

This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.

In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."

Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.

In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.

And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?

Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.

But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.
Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.

What do you think about this?  It seems to me that, while I don't at this
point vote either way, there is another factor in the equation that I don't
see mentioned.  What if you also  hypothesize that those identified people
are going to die anyway?  We have pretty good evidence that some of the
people on the plane that went down in Pennsylvania were thinking this way.

I would bet that we'll be there.  I'll bring my check book.  Is the 97 cab $32 retail?  If it is, it's worth it. 

With Barry doing what he did, getting to the playoffs was icing on the cake.  But, man, that Friday night game was a heart-breaker.

We'll see you Sunday!

Kisses,

I will order the wine tomorrow if you really will be by on Sunday.  I can
only have 2 cases delivered at a time.  So I'll get the Coastal first.  It
comes to $152.74 (less $80) = $72.74

The 97 cab will be $193.50
Total = $266.24

The Assembly Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to take
up SBX2 78.  The bill may be taken up by the full Assembly after that,
however, that decision has not been made because several Legislators have
indicated that they may not be in Sacramento tomorrow.

The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee is going to meet sometime today
off the floor to take up SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) which would establish a
windfall profits tax.  Additional amendments will be taken that will make
the tax effective on January 1, 2002, define exempt wholesale generator,
marketer, broker, and aggregator, by referencing their PUC definitions, and
exempt QFs.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee will meet upon
adjournment of session today to take up SBX2 39, which would give the CPUC
regulatory authority over non-IOU generation facilities, for
reconsideration.  The bill failed passage during its prior hearing.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee is scheduled to take
up the following bills on September 4 at 1:30 p.m.:

SBX2 85 (Burton) - This bill would prevent the CPUC, upon termination of the
10 percent rate reduction for residential and small commercial customers set
forth in subdivision (a) of Section
368, from subjecting those residential and small commercial customers to any
rate increases or future rate obligations solely as a result of the
termination of the 10 percent rate reduction.

SBX2 18 (Burton) - This bill would establish a dedicated rate component.

Hi Evie:
 
Two quick things:
 
1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?
 
2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.
 
Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.
 
Best,
Jeff

Mike:
A few thoughts:
Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison.
If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.
No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.
The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.
Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).
The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.
Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.
All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea.
I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.
On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Timing for QF meeting with Edison

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: DA Suspended, but NOT retroactively


The Commission has just voted 3-2 to approve the draft ALJ Barnett decision=
, modified to be prospective only.  There is NO retroactive suspension.
=20

Carl Wood introduced the ALJ's draft decision, with a diatribe against dire=
ct access.  He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to =
large customers and an example of the saying that, "big dogs eat first and =
big dogs eat best."  He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens=
ion and no retroactivity.  He said he "finds it hard to consider these comm=
ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous."  He added that, "Smal=
l consumers effectively have no options."  He said retroactivity will be th=
e subject of further review, although it was not clear what this meant.  Wi=
thin 14 days, the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t=
o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 9/20/01.  He said that dire=
ct access is half of the failed deregulation process; the other half was op=
ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market.  He said that supporter=
s of DA engage in "hollow rhetoric."  The market has failed in the state, a=
nd, "We need to put an end to the lack of social responsibility in the elec=
tric market."

He concluded that several commenters had indicated that direct access was a=
 way for making green power available to residential customers.  He respond=
ed that this just means other customers are getting more dirty coal-fired p=
ower.  He concluded that advocates of direct access make a "fraudulent clai=
m of customer choice." <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-mic=
rosoft-com:office:office" />

Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate, responding to Wood.  He sa=
id he had learned how to count, and he can count to three.  He then briefly=
 summarized his alternate.  First, he expressed disappointment in the Sacra=
mento process and the fact that they had not yet done something to rescue d=
irect access.  Second, he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from=
 that of other people.  He said he had always opposed the AB 1890 provision=
 that instituted the UDC buy-sell arrangement, saying that it eliminated th=
e largest customers from direct access.  Commissioner Duque then spoke brie=
fly to indicate his support for the Bilas alternate draft decision and his =
strong support for direct access.=20

Commissioner Brown said first, "In the weight of these sad times we must ob=
ey.  We are paying the price of the severe energy crisis which occurred las=
t year and the extraordinary means that were used to resolve it."  In an or=
dinary market, he thinks DA is good, but there is no way it can coexist wit=
h the State's $22 billion worth of bonds.  Therefore, there is no question =
that it has to be suspended.  "We probably should have done so months ago, =
in order to avoid a last-minute stampede."  There is an inequity between cu=
stomers that have moved to opt for direct access and those who have not.  B=
ut sometimes "you don't have a lot of good choices, and this is one of thos=
e times."  "If future legislation comes forward, and we hope that it would,=
" the Commission will attempt to revise this action.  =20

President Lynch noted the State Senate leadership has written asking for a =
study to be delivered by 1/1/02 as to how DA can be maintained without bias=
 to ratepayers and she supported this action.=20

Bilas and Duque indicated they will both file dissents.=20

In conclusion, we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac=
cess suspension.  We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su=
spension itself, on legal/procedural grounds.

I took the plunge and got LASIK about a month ago. 
Amazing to be without glasses or contacts for the
first time in 20 years.  VERY convenient.  

Although some people tell me they miss the specs on

Burbank's the ticket.  Can you get there direct?  If not, let's do LAX, but Burbank is preferrable.  Less of a zoo.

For Montana Power, a Broadband Dream
May Turn Out to Be More of a Nightmare


By BILL RICHARDS 
Special to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


BUTTE, Mont. -- This is a gamblers' town. More than a century ago, Marcus Daly turned a bet on a copper vein under Butte into the giant Anaconda Co. The gambling game Keno was invented here for bored miners. In 1974, stuntman Evel Knievel, a Butte native, made headlines betting -- unsuccessfully -- that he could jump the Snake River Canyon on his rocket-powered motorcycle.

Now, Bob Gannon, another Butte native, and chairman and chief executive of Montana Power Co., is betting he can pull off his own breathtaking stunt: He plans to turn his staid 89-year-old utility into a high-tech high-flier.

 [gannon] <http://interactive.wsj.com/public/resources/images/Gannon_Bob-FM23808212001221914.gif>

In one dizzying two-year stretch, the Butte-based utility has sold just about all its assets -- power plants, transmission lines, dams, gas, coal and oil fields -- pouring much of the $1.6 billion take into a coast-to-coast fiber-optic network. By the end of this year, Mr. Gannon boasts, Montana Power will have 26,000 miles of fiber in the ground, a new corporate name, Touch America, and it will be among the nation's largest half-dozen broadband companies.

So far, Mr. Gannon's gamble seems to be following the same trajectory as Mr. Knievel's. The joke around here is that at least Mr. Knievel wore a parachute.

Indeed, while plenty of companies have been hammered by the telecommunications bust, few have taken a more severe beating than Montana Power. Under Mr. Gannon's leadership, the company sold out of the energy business just as electric rates were taking off and bought into broadband as it was poised to tank. Now, only 5% to 10% of Touch America's fiber is being used.

Mr. Gannon's makeover of the venerable utility has touched off warfare here, pitting Montana Power against regulators, investors, consumer advocates and its own former corporate customers. The company's stock, which hit a high of $65 a share five days after Mr. Gannon announced his decision to dump the utility business in March of last year, has spiralled downward since. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, it was at $7.90.

The decision by Montana Power's board to authorize a 6.6 million share buyback during the plunge didn't boost Mr. Gannon's image either. The spree cost the company $204.8 million; the purchased shares are now valued at about $52 million.

But perhaps most galling to Montanans are the huge gains made by PPL Corp., the Pennsylvania utility that bought Montana Power's electric generating plants. PPL has sold nearly a third of the plants' power out-of-state at a huge markup, producing record profits. Meanwhile, state utility regulators, angry at Mr. Gannon's refusal to share proceeds of the asset sale with customers, have locked his company into a painful contract: Montana Power is required to continue supplying power to its 288,000 customers until 2007, even though it owns no more power plants. That has forced the company to purchase electricity from PPL. Montana Power, which is barred from raising customer rates, has been losing money on the transactions.

Long, Expensive Fight

The five-member utility commission could decide to let Montana Power boost its rates next year. But the high price of providing power has already drained the company's coffers. To cut back on its expenses, Montana Power agreed in June to pay $62.5 million to cancel the last year-and-a-half of a long-term supply contract with one of its biggest commercial customers, Butte-based Advanced Silicon Materials.

Last week, in an unusual lawsuit filed in state district court in Helena, eight Montana Power shareholders charged the utility, its board, and its senior executives and consultants with a "breach of fiduciary duty" for failing to get shareholders' approval for the company's transformation. The suit seeks a rollback of Mr. Gannon's makeover, charging the effort has cost shareholders $3 billion. It also seeks to return to shareholders what it calls PPL's "illegal" gains from power sales.

"We're trying to salvage the pension funds of thousands of Montanans who are wrapped up in this company," says Frank Morrison Jr., a former state Supreme Court justice and one of the attorneys filing the suit. Six of the state's largest law firms collaborated on the suit, Mr. Morrison says, "because we anticipate a long, expensive fight." Montana Power would not discuss its reasons for not seeking shareholder approval for the makeover but says it has done nothing wrong and will defend itself vigorously.

All this has tattered Mr. Gannon's reputation as a hometown genius. Just last year, Wall Street analysts and media praised his bold makeover plan. He was cheered during the company's annual meeting, a folksy conclave held at Butte's Mother Lode Theater that is part business session, part homecoming party. More than a third of the company's registered shareholders live in Montana.

But this year, angry shareholders and customers have picketed the company's headquarters, and Web sites are springing up across the state to rally voters to punish Montana Power. Earlier this month, Michelle Lee, a Democratic legislator from Livingston, launched Dumpthedeal.com (www.dumpthedeal.com <http://www.dumpthedeal.com/>1), a Web site urging a referendum to repeal deregulation of the electric industry in Montana. She says the site drew more than 1,000 visitors in its first two weeks.

"A lot of people here just can't believe what's happened to Montana Power,'' says Ralph McCaughy, who retired from the company's data-processing department three years ago. Mr. McCaughy, who is 62 years old and has throat cancer, says he and his wife, Jean, had planned to use some of their Montana Power shares and dividends to buy a new car to replace their wheezy 1993 Honda and take a trip to Hawaii. Montana Power stopped paying dividends last year as part of the makeover.

Mr. McCaughy says his spending plans are on hold. "I don't know whether Gannon and the bunch running the company couldn't stop themselves or what," he says.

Enduring Hecklers

These days, strangers sometimes blow raspberries and heckle Mr. Gannon during his daily two-block trek from his office to Gamer's, a local luncheonette that features a Butte specialty -- pork-chop sandwiches. The fact that Montana Power -- always one of the state's most powerful political forces -- led the lobbying drive for deregulation in the state hasn't helped his popularity. Deregulated electricity prices soared so high here last summer that several large Montana companies that had elected to buy power on the open market closed or cut back operations.

Steven Walsh, president of Montana Resources, which operates part of Anaconda's open-pit mine in Butte, says he shut the mine and laid off 322 people last summer after his electricity bill jumped to $627 a megawatt hour from $26 an hour in a week. Prices have begun to come down, but the mine is still shut.

"I don't hold any animosity toward Bob Gannon," Mr. Walsh says. "But around here I guess the general feeling is they made a big mistake."

Despite the company's battered stock price, some Wall Street analysts say they still have hope for the transformation, and they note that Touch America -- which expects to have $1.6 billion in assets, including $350 million in cash -- has a stronger balance sheet than most of its telecom competition.

Defending His Position

Mr. Gannon denies rumors that he has been punched out in several Butte bars, but Montana Power's Internet message boards are sizzling with rants by angry investors threatening to show up at this year's Sept. 14 annual meeting with tar, feathers, or worse.

"Bob's a decent human being and I still like the guy," says Paul Cote, the owner of Gamer's. "But I have heard people bad-mouthing him. There's a lot of people upset with him right now."

Mr. Gannon, who can see the house where he grew up -- beyond the Hock-It-To-Me pawnshop -- from his office window, defends his makeover decision. Energy deregulation during the late 1990s doomed smaller regional utilities such as Montana Power, he says, while fiber optics was becoming a glamour industry. The company had begun laying fiber-optic lines in the 1980s. As the business began to take off in the 1990s, Mr. Gannon and others believed they had a solid head start.

"There's a lot of second-guessing taking place now," he says. "But we were the ones sitting in the chair, and we made a decision that was absolutely correct and justified."

Others blame Montana Power's problems on overreaching by Mr. Gannon and the utility's management, as well as on strong salesmanship by Goldman Sachs, Montana Power's investment bankers. Critics of the deal have suggested that Montana Power's 11-member board -- stocked with seven Montanans -- might not have fully appreciated the risks and challenges of the fiber-optic business.

"They were intoxicated by their stock price and Wall Street was telling them, 'Hey, you're on a roll,' " says Robert Anderson, a Public Service Commission member. "These were utility guys. What did they know about the telecommunications business?"

Mr. Gannon and other senior officials who were part of the Policy Leadership Group, a Montana Power internal decision-making team, say that until shortly before last year's makeover announcement they hadn't decided to turn Montana Power into a telecom. At first, Mr. Gannon says, the group had been "comfortable" with a more limited step: an initial public offering of the Touch America unit. The group also considered spinning off Touch America to Montana Power's shareholders or continuing to build it up within the company, he says.

Goldman Sachs, which has worked with the utility for 17 years, urged the company's management to drop its power business entirely, company officials say. Goldman specialists from New York, Los Angeles and Chicago made more than 100 visits to Butte, camping at the Copper King Motel and advising the utility executives on their options. As the discussions went on, company officials say, divestiture of the power business seemed the most logical choice. Mr. Gannon and others say Goldman's bankers warned that the IPO market was losing its luster and urged them to sell their power-making assets quickly to get the best price.

Matt Darnell, a Goldman managing director who advised Montana Power on its move toward telecommunications, declines to give specifics of Goldman's recommendations to either the policy group or Montana Power's board. "There were numerous options explored," he says, "but we certainly supported the thoughtful and deliberative approach the board took."

Of the subsequent downward turn of events, Mr. Darnell says: "The telecommunications industry has taken a turn no one expected."

For its advice, Goldman will get 2.5% of the gross payout from the asset sale, or about $14.2 million, a Montana Power spokesman says. Goldman officials say they are no longer advising Montana Power on its business plan.

Mr. Gannon scoffs at the notion that his company made the wrong move. In a strongly worded letter last week, he urged shareholders to approve the final pieces of his makeover plan at the Sept. 14 annual meeting. He warned that if the shareholders rejected the measures, Montana Power's board would seek to accomplish the divestiture of the utility business through unspecified "other methods."

Demand for fiber-optic networks will regain strength before long, Mr. Gannon says. When it does, Touch America could have an advantage over its debt-laden competition. Mr. Gannon says his company will emerge as one of the telecom industry's strongest national players, with no debt and a state-of-the-art technology.

"There are a lot of suggestions in watering holes around this state that Goldman was flying around the West looking for a bunch of guys to dupe and that we were a bunch of rubes from Montana who got taken in," he says. "That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard."

Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points. 

The contracts Davis signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.
If elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate Davis' Public Power Authority.
If elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.

I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:

With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.

I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).

Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.  

I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.

Best,
Jeff

PS Given DYN and ENE share prices today, looks like the market loves the combination.  That's pretty nice.  (Wouldn't know it by what Rebecca Smith keeps writing, though.  Gives the impression that she won't be content until we're reduced to ashes--shame.)

The CEC just approved a report drafted by staff that states there will be adequate natural gas supply this winter for electricity generation needs.  It does qualify this statement by discussing where potential bottlenecks in delivery might occur and recommends actions to address the bottlenecks.  See below for a link to the report.

Energy Commission Report Projects 
Improved Natural Gas Supplies For the State 



Sacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.

The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified "yes" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.

Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.

The newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.

"This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future," said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.

To help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.

Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.

I will be quoted along the lines of the letter, but at this point, I'm in no hurry.
 
I appreciate your support with Hap, though, very much.
 
I don't mind taking risks, but I don't want to precipitate a palace coup led by Calpine.

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

Sue and Jeff --

I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).  Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.

My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.  Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?

Thanks.

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

It appears that Davis has officially called the Legislature back to try to address the Edison issue.  Appears they'll reconvene beginning next Tuesday.  We'll report back when we get additional information.  There are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a "task force" comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue.  Burton is reported to have said that he's telling senators who are on vacation that "this isn't worth cancelling a vacation over."
 
Best,
Jeff

Jeff - 

Thank you for this info - and for all of the hard work that you and the team are doing everyday.....

I know that the distribution lists are probably pretty hard to keep up with, but please make sure to include Evan Hughes, Murray O'Neill, Brenda Herod on  distribution lists for issues on this topic.

I would like to be on the distribution list for all of your California communication - and I think in large part, have been except for the message below.

Thank you!

Dan

Subject:	Commission Clarifies DA Suspension Decision--Requires Utilities to Accept DASRs for Facility Adds Under Contracts Signed Before 10.20.01

?	In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
?	The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
?	Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
?	In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
?	Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
?	Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
?	The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
?	If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	$.01 surcharge as "tax"

A typical clause reads as follows:

" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include "any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates."

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes "applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes "applicable prior to the Delivery Point."  The surcharge would seem to be applicable "at the Delivery Point."

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the "frozen tariff" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of "taxes" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

Hi Jeff,

I have been wanting to e-mail you to meet up for lunch, now that I am in the city.  I know you are super busy, but let me know if you have time.  The only day that is not good is Tuesday - I have an aerobics class at 1 with a gay drill sergeant - he's great!  He dances around the class yelling at us.

Also, we are planning a trip to Tahoe the weekend of Dec 15th to celebrate graduation.  I know you're not, but let me know if you want to come.

take care and hope to see you soon,
Jackie

Am I reading this right?  The gas contracts are $5B out of the money (from CA's perspective)?  Are they straight gas deals?

Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

 Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

FYI.  In case you hadn't heard, the " bailout" that Edison struck with the California PUC would allow Edison to spend up to $250MM "to hedge fuel cost risks associated with SCE's Utility Retained Generation and QF and interutility contracts."

 and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.  =
Please note that items marked with (*) would require your input.  Please cl=

Despite the postponement of company presentations this week by PWC-FAS,
Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo, all three companies as of today still plan
to conduct their on-campus interviews as scheduled.  Thus, to ensure that
they receive your resumes with time to prepare their interview lists, the
resume drop deadline for these companies, as well as Citigroup, will remain
Friday, September 14th, at 11:59 p.m.

We are currently working with the companies to reschedule their
presentations as soon as possible.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if
you have any questions or concerns.

Hello All -- With all the uncertainty this has been a difficult project to concentrate on, however, here is a first stab at establishing criteria for evaluating the prospects for retail service state-by-state, and by major LDC.  Some of these criteria may be consolidated or eliminated as the matrix progresses.  I have differentiated between transportation (C&I customers can receive distribution service separate from commodity) as opposed to Customer Choice whereby C&I and Residential customers may have alternative service choices.  PLEASE LOOK OVER THE MATRIX  with an eye towards changes.  Nothing is set in stone and the simpler and more relevant we make it the better the product.  Thanks all.

rent "true grit."  very cool. I highly recommend--from a great coming-of-age girl's novel.  also try "wake of the red witch."  and, of course, "stagecoach."

FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  

Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.

In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.

The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  

We'll report back with news as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

I spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy.  As of
9:30 a.m. this morning the Governor has still not officially called for a
Third Extraordinary Session, or, for the Second Extraordinary Session to
reconvene.  In fact, Senate staff is continuing to prepare for their annual
golf excursion next Tuesday. In addition, while staff from the Senate and
the Administration have met, the Administration has yet to produce either a
new version of SBX2 78, or, amendments to the existing version of SBX2 78.
Staff reiterated that they believe there is still no chance of passing SBX2
78 in its current form.

Subject: SBX2 78 - Update



The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed,
some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee
members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by
TURN and other consumer groups.

During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and
Richard Katz from the Governor=19 s office regarding a couple of issues
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently,
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff=19 s request.  D.J. agreed that the =
bill
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard abou=
t
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct
access.  We suggested that =1C shall=1D be changed to =1C may=1D in order t=
o give more
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn=19 t necessarily op=
pose
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can
totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to
push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this
bill passes.

There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor=19 s
desk.

The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote o=
n
additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.

Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.

two marketers say that there will be no "exit fees" -- i.e., no

Hi Jeff:

1.    Don't know at this point what if anything we'll do.  We haven't,
as you undoubtedly seen, taken a lead on DA issues.  We do, however,
have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be.
More when that develops.

2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.  He typically works with the QFs who
have contracts to sell power; I work more on the consumer side with the
QFs who build primarily to self-serve.    (In other words, he looks more
a power generation, I look more at end-user issues.)  Certainly feel
free to call him.  He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe
he'll be here tomorrow.

Hope you're safe and well.

Hi Evie:

Two quick things:

1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for
rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of
appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC
erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and
that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right
before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done
getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to
re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing
anything?

2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas,
but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether
that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same
folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.

Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings
A step in the right direction- the CDWR paid their bill in full for the
February 2001 trade month.

The ISO will be disbursing the dollars a week from today.  One other
important highlight is that the ISO invoiced the DWR for all charges
associated with meeting the net short of the utilities and they did pay in
full- we were expecting they would make only a partial payment. I'm glad we
were wrong.  We can now hold our breath for the rest of the $$.  Please give
me a call with any questions

Subject:	Extensions of CA Deals

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly.

We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June.  Understanding that "new" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  

The 3 choices I see are:

1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.
2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.
3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.

It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.

The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.  MDS

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:Part 2:  PUC Approves Edison Bailout

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Thoughts on PX Credit Claim with Edison

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

Here's my take.  Slash away at will.  Sue, saw your notes, but didn't try to incorporate.  You should add anything I've missed, got wrong, etc.  Pulled it together quickly.  Hope there aren't too many errors.  And hope it helps.

Hey.  Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite.  Does the course seem like it will be good?  Were there a million people there?  Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway.  I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  Good to see you the other night.  Take care.

Best,
Jeff

Hey there!

How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
class has been a new low point in terms of educational
value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now.

Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
bay much.

Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
you around?

Let me know how you are...
Courtney

Thanks, Jeanne.

Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.  Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.  Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Sue and Jeff --

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.

FYI:
On the call today with Jeremy Blachman & Co. today, we decided to the do the following:

Sue will make sure that EES legal (Mike Smith) reviews ARMs petition to modify the Commission's order suspending DA.
Sue will send Jeremy a one-page summary of the petition and Jeremy will use it to solicit participation from Enron customers (i.e., see if any are willing to sign the petition).
Jeff will work with Karen Denne to start drafting a couple of one-page letters that customers would sign and send to Legislators in the event Davis is successful in calling them back in October to work on energy matters.

Let us know if you have any questions.
 
Best,
Jeff

We'd love to play golf, but because of all this, it seems like Cameron and I 
are just going to chill in SF this weekend. We've been out of town every 
weekend for the past six months, it seems.

Good luck!

Please let me know all the various costs that you've incurred on our behalf and not been compensated for.  I know we owe you $65(?) dollars for the guitar.  Is there anything else?  Let's play soon.

Getting alot of inquiries.

The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.

We'll report back as soon as something happens.

For folks who want to listen in, the number is:

415.228.4550
code = 92105

Best,
Jeff

Overall looks great, though I made a few edits/comments.  But I couldn't figure out how to do it in strikeout/underline.  We should make it look as "PG&E-centric" as possible--you know how touchy IOUs are.

You and Dave and I should try to discuss in more detail early next week.

Best,
Jeff

Thank very much Joseph.  Alan and Sue, I'm comfortable canceling tomorrow's call unless either of you have a burning issue to discuss.  We can start with the new arrangements beginning next Thursday, assuming that works for folks.

Folks,
to clarify...

1) The recurring call-in number for this weekly call has already been established, which is as follows 
	(same as last week):

	Call-in Toll-free:	(800) 998-2462
	Passcode:		5549022

2) Just prior to this e-mail going out, Paul had indicated to me that we should cancel the call
	as he will be unavailable (enroute/traveling to D.C.).

Thanks,

Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

We might be able to communicate this less formally through our lobbyists.  If it's OK, let me check with them first, and then I'll get back to you.  Sound good?

We are not giving any more money in California.  To that end we just sent a letter to the D's saying, essentially, "we're giving the money we thought we were going to give you to the N.Y. Disaster Relief fund."   Prior to the "no more money" decision, we also concluded that it made no sense to give individual donations.  So ... the following should a letter similar to the following should work:    

"Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in your October 24 reception.  Earlier this year, we made a corporate decision to direct our campaign dollars in California to the California Republican Party and not participate in individual races."  

Jeff: your thoughts??

Dear CMTA Members:

From: Jack Stewart, President - California Manufacturers & Technology
Association

The California Manufacturers & Technology Association is hosting a major
foreign policy and international trade speech by President George Bush!
President Bush is making the stop as he travels to China on a two-day state
visit and the White House asked us just yesterday to host the event.

?	Sacramento Memorial Auditorium
?	11:00 am to noon
?	October 17th, 2001

?	Yes, that's next Wednesday!

As a valued CMTA member, a complimentary ticket has been reserved for you or
another employee of your company.

BUT YOU MUST RSVP WITH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER to Geri Royer at
916-498-3330 or groyer@cmta.net by 4:00pm (PDT), October 12th, 2001.

Please take advantage of this opportunity that your CMTA membership affords
you.

If you would like to come in the night of October 16, we have held a block
of rooms at the Sacramento Hyatt Regency Hotel (916/443-1234) at a rate of
$140 night.  Just ask to reserve your room under the CMTA block.
Reservations must also be made by October 12 to guarantee this rate.

This is a great opportunity to support the President and send him off on his
first foreign trip since the terrorist attacks on September 11.

As you know, security will be tight so there cannot be any exceptions on the
October 12, 4:00pm (PDT) RSVP DEADLINE.

We hope to hear back from you quickly and look forward to seeing you in
Sacramento next Wednesday.

I would have been happy to let you have it.  You still can, you know.  Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it another time.  And what about those 9-ers?

Religion, huh?  Interesting.  Your folks may disown you, though.  I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?

The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.  Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.

The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?  Next week or week after?  (May want to wait until plane service gets normal?)

Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?  Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!  Sell the flat, dammit.

Kisses,
Jeff

Nope.  She was in NY last week, though.  Scary.

I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday now also!!  On Tuesdays I have a
religion class through UC Extension (its all on how the different religions
view "why we are here").  Pretty relevant for today, huh?

On Wednesdays I am taking a cooking class at home chef in Laurel Village.
Should be fun.

Bet my classes are better than your classes.

The pilot at Enron is going EXTREMELY well.  I will get you the name of our
champion.  He wants to introduce this all over Enron.  Energy Services just
loves it.  Ian has been living out there in Houston for almost two weeks
now.

How are the meetings coming along with Deal Bench and Net Works?

We are still in Santa Cruz - we'll be back tomorrow, hopefully we'll see you
Wed night after class??

Subject: Ok - this is what I did


As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice
message
on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the
paging
service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the
games
were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle
and
both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that
you
must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on
the
team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered
all
remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what
you
sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm
sorry if
it wasn't the right thing.

Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when
you
called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
been fair to change it at that point.

Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?

Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.

FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that:

"Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. "

Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

Subject: Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost
Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Dan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m=
emory



(Published Aug. 29, 2001)=20

Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in =
decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics=
.=20

The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray D=
avis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining=
 its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is =
odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll=
ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20

Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated=
 around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea=
ched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util=
ity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft=
er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo=
th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l=
ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta=
il rates.=20

Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a=
spect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i=
tself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad=
vertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi=
slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to =
do.=20

Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s=
uggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin=
ancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi=
ng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft=
er bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str=
ong as PG&E's.=20

The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal=
ly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians=
 do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E=
dison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd=
s. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou=
t for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme =
because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed =
under state control.=20

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, or=
dinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making suc=
h a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would Davis=
 put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition =
that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g=
overnor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20

Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" nea=
r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo=
rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St=
reet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20

Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso=
n. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bry=
son was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong=
 ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b=
y Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to la=
unch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.=20

The most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christ=
opher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. Bryson a=
nd Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to tak=
e command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch =
the red ink. Davis refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to=
 keep Edison out of bankruptcy court.=20

We may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison, but we will know, v=
ery soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.=

As soon as I get my grades (which I hope will be mid-late December), I'll send them to Ginger in the attempt to get tuition reimbursed.  But don't worry, I have extremely low expectations about the likelihood of getting reimbursed.  This plan make sense?

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.  Apologies.
 

About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

Best,

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

Re:        Action Needed for Veto on Workers' Comp Bill (SB 71)

The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers'
compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on
its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers

$3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to
help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the
Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a
negotiating mood.

There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor

entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a
$1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous
to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton
and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press
conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a
slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB
71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers'
costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured
workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or
someone else.

Steve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the
governor's point person on workers' compensation said, "the
governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of
labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion
about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is
comfortable with."  Smith dismissed the threat of labor
turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has
stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he
would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else.

Now that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that
employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on
SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at http://www.cmta.net/issues/index.

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right."
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

Best,
Jeff

Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. 
All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. 
When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. 
Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. 
At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. 
Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. 
Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. 
A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. 
That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. 
By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. 
Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. 
Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

Generators, including Mirant Corp. ( MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investm=
ents/quotes/?symbol=3DMIR>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/new=

 news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDYN>, msgs <htt=
p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought app=
arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

i talked to david fleisig at pg&e last night. he begged for simple term sheet that could be flushed out in definitive documentation.
would you add the following for people to comment on in the term sheet:
we will oppose the assessment of an underscheduling penalty at the ferc.
they will oppose the assessment of any surcharge to da customers by the cpuc for any of their undercollections.
we will both cooperate to either get ferc alj approval of the settlement or if we waive this requirement in our discretion (e.g. if some holdup there/we want to close fast), they will immediately pay to us any refund that we end up paying that goes to them.

great time.  SO sorry I passed out.  Man, I just suddently hit the wall.

On the Jay thing.  There's no pressure at all.  If you guys are uncertain, that's no problem.  Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead.  Most importantly in the near term.  Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals?  Just let me know.  And again, let's keep this light.  No frictions.  Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are, etc. etc. etc.  Worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships.

Keep your taht moh rising.

FYI. The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts. May be part of Davis' attempt to "re-negotiate" the contracts.  There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified.

Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc.


Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons
to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the
bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as
follows:

   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be
   exempt from paying for the bonds.

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power
   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power
   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would
only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took
place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that
took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree
during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able
to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which
can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that
we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill
clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment
to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that
switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And
if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the
bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

I am sick of keeping track of lots of little documents, so I have assembled in one document and attached the latest version of my contract descriptions.

Thanks for the response.  I think that I've got it cleared up.  I'm assuming that the time for our case write is "the present," i.e., September 2001.  If I've got that wrong, let me know.

Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Best,
Jeff

How would we calculate EES' "contribution" to SCE undercollection?

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?

Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?
 
Best,
Jeff

 <<X28621.DOC>>

Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the Revised Proposed
Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.  WGSI and Enron have
indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has indicated an
interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering joining in
our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with underline and
strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow. These comments
must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness of the
draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the little
bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers, I see
little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the Commission
proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be overturned by the
Court of Appeals.

I look forward to your comments.

Mike Day

Thanks again for the stuff.  I can take it from here.  Two quick questions.
1) Is there anything that's top secret that I shouldn't be talking about?
2) Do we have anything for LNG activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity?

Thanks again.  I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up.

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
"Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
"This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." 
"Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."

Do we have any recent presentations, position papers, memos, etc. on (1) the CA history/situation  and (2) Enron's role in the market.  Kind of generic, but I am putting together a presentation for potential investors in CA deals.

Thanks.  As you know, I'm in the negotiations.  It's the best chance there =
is to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether C=
alifornia can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard=
 to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with =
Jan would be useful and appreciated.

FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO=20
Updated: Friday, September 21, 2001 04:53 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JON=
ES NEWSWIRES=20
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20
At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20
The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20
"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20
ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20
The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20
If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20
"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20
The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20
"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20
The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20
Generators Confused=20
Generators, including Mirant Corp. (MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investme=
nts/quotes/?symbol=3DMIR>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news=
/?symbol=3DMIR>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbo=

 news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDUK>, msgs <htt=
p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDUK>) and Dynegy Inc. =
(DYN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DDYN>, news <ht=
tp://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDYN>, msgs <http://quick=
en.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought apparently i=
nexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later that the=
 price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegations, the I=
SO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market"=
 purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=
articipants see.=20
DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20
The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20
None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20
The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20
The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20
"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

Tom --

I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."

The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  

I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.

The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.  What should we do??

Jim

Financial 
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
Peter Behr
  
07/06/2001 
The Washington Post 
FINAL 
Page E01 
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. 
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. 
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.

As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with Edison.
Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
The call was short and ended with an agreement that:
	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 
	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

If anyone has any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: ABX2 9


According to Assembly Member Migden's office, if enacted, they believe ABX2
9 does provide the CPUC with adequate direction to address community
aggregation separate from other forms of direct access.  They have also had
conversations with the Treasurer's office who informed them that as written,
the Treasurer does not believe ABX2 9 would pose a problem for the bonds.
That said, they have still not received any indication from the Governor's
office as to whether or not he will sign the measure into law so they have
not had conversations with the CPUC.

Subject: RE: Extensions of CA Deals


I also agree.  Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation
issues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities
will insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go
screaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any
portion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20.  As indicated in
previous calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept
20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be
extended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct
access without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension
IF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20.  At this
time we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although
as Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which
will likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the
commission on these issues.  Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural
schedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues.

Bottom line:  The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by
means of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after
Sept. 20.  Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the
existing agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal
or extension issue is addressed by the Commission.  Post Sept. 20 amendments
to the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the
pre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to
Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to
refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the
court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to
Angelides, instead.

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the
press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes,
etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own
energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of
massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the
public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end
direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just
not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario
Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.
Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter
would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Jeff

Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful
or not?  Two things occur to me.  First, it is not becoming for a
commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of
industry -- particularly if you're a Democrat.  Second, it has always
struck me that what she needs is some form of record support, not
political pats on the back in one-page letters.  I am asking you these
questions not judging the proposal to send a letter .... but I've never
understood what they're supposed to do for her and I honestly would like
to understand.

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.
Best,
Jeff
CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible.
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved.
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts.
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind.
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves?
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State.
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers.
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Generally OK given the alternatives but need clarification on certain
issues.  Is this just a Bilas thing or are the votes there to get it passed
even with the modifications?

Lad,

What does this do to the BCAP filing?

Folks:
Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with
SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks
feel about it generally.  Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff

The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about these matters.  Thank you.

Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:

1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."

Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.

Best,
Jeff

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

Hello Environmental and Energy Committee Members:

Please see the following request from Dr. Kenneth Lim of the BAAQMD.  The
information he seeks is in support of a petition for additional State
funding for BAAQMD programs.  I understand how short the notice is, but if
you can provide Dr. Lim some information, I think he and the BAAQMD would be
very appreciative.  If you would like to send me your data, I will forward
it to Ken Lim without your company information.

     Ms. Margaret Bruce:
     SVMG

     Hi Margaret:

     I had sent this message to Justin Bradley last week, but have not
     heard back from him.  I should have sent it to you also.

     I hope that things are going well with you.

     I'm trying to assess the emissions impact of increased Back-Up
     Generator (BUG) diesel fuel use from 2000 to 2001.  I need real data
     to support an effort to get state funds to help mitigate the
     additional emissions in the Bay Area.  This is NOT for compliance,
     enforcement, or rulemaking, etc. purposes.  I could use your help.

     I would need 2000 and 2001 data for diesel fuel use or hours of BUG
     operation:

     BUG engine, hp, fuel use 2000 and 2001 to date.  One comparison might
     be 10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     We want to verify, if it is true, that business and industry felt
     compelled by the energy situation to operate their diesel BUGs more
     hours and burn more fuel (fuel readiness testing and emergency backup
     power) than in past comparable periods.

     I was hoping that you could provide some actual use data for the
     back-up diesel engines at your SVMG member companies.  I would need
     specific engine information as indicated above.  The data information
     can be as simple as total diesel fuel use for the first 9 months of
     2000 versus the first 9 mos. of 2001.  Ideally, we would prefer
     10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     I'm seeking this information at your earliest convenience (by the end
     of the day Wednesday).  Please telephone or e-mail me if you have any
     questions.  My apologies for this short notice (I did send in an
     inquiry to Justin on 10/22/01).  Thanks very much for your
     consideration.

     Ken

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

I love it.  Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.  If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., "Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for"), it would really bring the house down.  But I think that ENA would get damn queasy about doing it.

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Thanks very much Mike.  The sense of urgency for getting this in "the mix" is not as high as it was yesterday, though we'll still need to introduce it at some point very soon.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

FYI   Here is the language I gave Jeff to propose for an amendment to the
Sher Bond bill  which will make sure Direct Access customers don't pay for
DWR power costs through the bonds EXCEPT for power they actually used that
was purchased by DWR.  Houston has to ok this and then Jeff has to sell it.

I also strongly recommend that the next to the last sentence of Water Code
Section 80110 be repealed in the bill.  That would leave direct access in
place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable
exit fee provisions.  Without a change like this, the bill would simply
reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the
Commission.  There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the
PUC to not suspend direct access.

I assume you heard about what happened at the PUC today.  I think it classfies as amazing.  The planets may be favorably re-aligning just al ittle bit (one hopes).

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Just a reminder:

Beginning tomorrow, the (formerly twice-weekly) California call will now take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT/1:30 CDT), same call-in number.
Until the next legislative session starts up in January, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento, unless something specific requires their participation.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is the strawman.  Note that the Sheet 2--drops participation to bare essentials.  Sheet 3 assumes a 40% budget cut from Sheet 1.   The deleted actions are different in Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.  

Jeff:  Please review ASAP, add the gas matters to Sheet 1, delete gas matters that are not essential in Sheet 2, and take a 40% haircut in Sheet 3.  Also add back any other matters that I have deleted that you disagree with, but make sure that Sheet 3 continues to meet the 40% haircut target.  Then send to Sue Mara for review.

Jeff:

Thanks again for all of your time and consideration with respect to our con=
sideration of Norm Pedersen to join our Firm in Los Angeles.  I just wanted=
 to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue t=
hings further with Norm.  After drilling down even further, it just seemed =
like we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based =
upon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the n=
ature of Norm's historical client base.  It also would not have been fair t=
o Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he=
 had planned to pursue at the Firm.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate=
 your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the sit=
uation.  I really felt bad bothering you with this, but I knew you would ha=
ve the best insights into the likely direction of the regulatory proceeding=
s in CA and I wanted to make sure that I was being fair in evaluating Norm'=
s situation and in a position to make a decision based on all of the releva=
nt facts.  I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use =
those words together!) that I do not want you to think or feel that you "ni=
xed" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.=
  In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a s=
ense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has b=
een pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-start=
er since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other sid=
e from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.  It is on=
e thing to receive a waiver to represent another company in a negotiated co=
mmercial transaction in which Enron is relying on another law firm, but I c=
ould not see us pressing a regulatory agenda directly adverse to Enron's in=
terests in a proceeding in which Enron was a major participant and which we=
 knew going into the proceedings at the start that our representation would=
 be adverse to Enron.

As Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have be=
en adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see=
 "eye to eye" with Enron on all of the issues.  These generally have been s=
ituations involving historical client relationships that go back decades wh=
ere Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been i=
ncredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those pro=
ceedings.  Nonetheless, I am trying to do whatever I can to try to eliminat=
e or reduce the number of those situations on a going forward basis, althou=
gh I know I will not be able to eliminate all of them in light of the size =
of our Firm and the diverse nature of its client base.

Jeff, I will follow up with you personally, but I just wanted to drop you a=
 quick note to thank you for the time and thought you devoted to this.   I'=
m sure we will be speaking soon on some CA regulatory matter or the other.

John

No problem.  Man, for someone who doesn't know much, you sure know alot, based on the note you sent.  It's your call on today's lesson.  If you're feeling under the weather, then we can pass for today.  Otherwise, I'll show up at 4:30.  Just let me know.  And you can decide anytime between now and 3:30.  I don't know how much Eldon and Rory can help, but they're both real knowledgeable and generally love thinking about this kind of stuff.

Hi Jeff - Here's the deal, I've had a cold for a few days. I'm probably past the contagious stage but this is not an exact science. I'm up for teaching today but I figure it's fair to let people know in case they're concerned. I'll see you at 4:30 unless I hear from you in which case I'll understand. Hey, thanks for facilitating this little DAW discussion group. I think I understand the procedure now. I had to hunt around a little for the "reply to all" command(not on my tool bar), but I found it. Now I'm ready. I'm still learning about a lot of this stuff. Later - Avram

Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).  Question:  Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?  One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.

Subject: Update on the Implementation of the Suspension of Direct Access


Below is a summary of the events which have been occurring since last week's
meeting between the UDCs and ESPs re the implementation of the suspension of
direct access:

1. On October 3rd, a small working group comprised of representatives of the
three UDCs, Enron, Commonwealth and UC/CSU had a conference call to discuss
the filing of a joint proposal on the numerous issues surrounding the
implementation of the suspension of direct access.  While SCE was
represented on the call, it was clear that they were not interested in a
joint proposal and would file their own plan.  On the call, drafting
assignments were divvied up and another call was scheduled for Tuesday the
9th.

2.  On October 4h (as directed by the decision suspending DA), the UDCs
submitted letters to the Energy Division on their progress in implementing
the suspension.  PG&E and SDG&E submitted a joint letter which basically set
forth what they had done to date and their progress of working with the
ESPs.  They stated that they anticipated filing a joint proposal with the
ESPs soon.  SCE, however, was more specific in its submission.  Therein, SCE
states that "SCE will not accept connect DASRs after October 20, 2001." The
submittal also states that "SCE will not process connect DASRs for service
accounts which did not exist on September 20, 2001."

3. On October 9th, a conference call was held between SDG&E, PG&E, Enron,
Commonwealth, NewWest and UC/CSU.  At that time, SDG&E and PG&E informed the
ESPs that they would not be able to file a joint proposal.  That, instead,
they would be filing an advice letter (probably joint between the two UDCs)
which proposed a connect DASR cut off date. While a definitive date was not
stated, they indicated that it would be around the end of the year.

4. PG&E and SDG&E stated that they would file such advice letters by the end
of the week.  Parties would have approximately 10 days to respond.

FYI   Here is the language I gave Jeff to propose for an amendment to the
Sher Bond bill  which will make sure Direct Access customers don't pay for
DWR power costs through the bonds EXCEPT for power they actually used that
was purchased by DWR.  Houston has to ok this and then Jeff has to sell it.

I also strongly recommend that the next to the last sentence of Water Code
Section 80110 be repealed in the bill.  That would leave direct access in
place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable
exit fee provisions.  Without a change like this, the bill would simply
reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the
Commission.  There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the
PUC to not suspend direct access.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Joe Pratt is the Cullen Professor of Business and History at the University of Houston and author of several energy business histories such of ConEd, Amoco, Texas Eastern Transmission Company, and the National Petroleum Council.  He will visit the issue from the vantage point of how are energy corporations perceived in the debate and controversy.  He is not an economist but is more market oriented than he used to be.  He is buddies with a Cal State professor, Chris Casteneda, who was Pratt's student at UH.

Dr. Pratt is also involved in the Enron oral history project with me.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

*********************************************************************
Fallout in California
 


PG&E remains in bankruptcy 

The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC


The California PUC and Edison reached agreement designed to keep Edison out of bankruptcy

On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return Edison to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit Edison to pay its creditors


The Davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts

California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts

Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis


California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice

Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility

The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California

Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hear you're in London.  Hope you're OK.  Unfathomable tragedy.
 
We're going to hold our 11:30 call in an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy.  Call will be brief.  With respect to Hap, John's asked me to hold off talking to him until John signals.  I agreed.  I'll keep you posted.  The State Capitol is closed down completely today.  Be safe.

Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

Thank you very much for your kind voicemail.  Unfortunately for Gov't Affairs, unless Steve and Rick have other plans, you all are stuck with me since I love working for Enron (even in California!).  Bizarre rumor, the origins of which baffle me....

Thanks again for the sweet voicemail.  And holy moly, sounds like you and Christi are going to be extremely busy at FERC.

Best,
Jeff

Let's try and set up a call to talk about the California intrastate gas issues noted below (LDC hedging, rate unbundling and system upgrades/expansions).  Does Tues. July 10 at 3:00 Central work for everyone?

(Roger please pass on to EES folks who should be on).

Thanks.

Leslie --

Can you organize a call that goes through these issues and begins to rationalize the information requested by Phillip?  While these issues are important, I don't see the CPUC doing anything in the near-term to help fix the problems.

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.

I don't understand the netting that you are referring to.  Does it mean that they will pay negative ctc's up to some just and reasonable amount and anything above the j&r level will be paid out when all of the other people are paid.  How do they define the "ESP's share of the undercollection?"

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Subject: Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy



Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE. 

1.      Form Enron Negotiation Team 

        My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.      Meet & Confer (10/29) 

        Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.      Reformed Stipulation 

        I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.      Meeting 

        My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees. 

Thanks, 

Jim

Here's the proposal:

There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.
The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)
If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Should you care, on Friday at the Hotel Monaco in SF, Law Seminars International is having a conference about electric restructuring in CA. The 8:30 AM panel is "status and implications of the PG&E Bankruptcy" with Jim Lopes and LInda Ekstrom.  I'll be in Sacramento that day.

Greetings, Comrades, and welcome back (for two thirds
of you, and for you first years:  don't forget to
breathe).

I am compelled (Diane Dimeff stands behind me with a
Louisville Slugger slapping menacingly against one
palm) to tell you that Haas has a Complaint
Department, namely the Student Advisory Committee
(SAC).  

The SAC is a formalized conduit for presenting the
School Administration with your thoughts, suggestions,
responses, recommendations, kisses and hugs of
appreciation as well as rants and rodomontades of
angry frustration on any subject with respect to your
experience at Haas.  We do this by means of the
Student Survey (more on this later), our distinguished
teacher awards (more on this later, too) and by
listening to you when all others have grown weary of
your whining.   

The Committee  currently consists of the following
students (we are looking for a couple of
representatives from among the first years, but more
on this later, as you probably suspected):

Eric Jordan, jordan@haas.berkeley.edu
Lesley Keffer, keffer@haas...
Sujan Punyamur, punyanur@haas...
Deepika Shah, dshah@haas...
Joseph Tambornino (me), Chairman, tamborni@haas...

Feel free to flag any of us down (especially Deepika
since she's the easiest to talk to) if you have a
gripe, a brainstorm, or a question about Haas that
Diane and her team have not already triaged for you. 
(Be forewarned, however: we will not reveal the secret
formula to Berk's Finance case.)

Best wishes in reacclimating yourself to school.  (At
least it gives you something to do if the dotcom bust
has left you "downsized," "rightsized," "laid off" or
otherwise dumped by your old employer.  Heck, who
needs them anyway?  Go start your own digital
revolution.)

Subject:	Timing for QF meeting with Edison

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 


URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL  <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL> 



(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 


The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 


As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 


But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 


"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 


The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 


Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 


The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 


"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 


The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 


The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 


It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 


While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 


Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 


The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 


The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 


"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

*********************************************************************
Fallout in California
 


PG&E remains in bankruptcy 

The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC


The California PUC and Edison reached agreement designed to keep Edison out of bankruptcy

On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return Edison to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit Edison to pay its creditors


The Davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts

California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts

Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis


California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice

Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility

The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California

Subject:	Reliant Protective Order


	Draft of transcribed message from Richard Sanders voice mail (Legal) to Rick Shapiro.  Rick forwarded to Jim Steffes.

	FYI:

	"We have not seen the Reliant Protective Order.  It's only been described to me by their General Counsel.  And in the way it was described it was a document that  we would probably agree to, because there's still some corks(? and provisions over disagreements about the Confidentiality. 

		So, I'm gonna try to get Mike Kirby to get ahold of it this a.m. in terms of the theme to the Legislators.  The question I've got is why haven't we even been offered that same deal?  It shows clearly that they're trying to isolate us, and that they're treating us differently from everyone else., but I'm not sure how far that goes....."

SCE's problem is that no one except Davis and Edison are for the bailout.  With respect to DA, only Burton's in the way.  So Davis and Edison have the world against; and DA only has Burton against it.  I'm at loss to determine which is worse off, which speaks to the craziness of the state of things.

Subject: Draft Application for Rehearing


Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtoodw eekend!

Greetings Folks:

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Enron's plans on 2 projects


Jeff and Stan:

I lead the group responsible for assuring safe, reliable and timely
generation electric interconnections with PG&E's D and T systems. I work
closely with Rod Boschee's group that handles gas gen interconnections.

I just wanted to check in with Enron to see if the company was still
planning to go ahead with the Los Banos project and the Lodi project. It's
important we know Enron's plans to assure we conduct the most accurate
transmission planning studies possible given the number of projects in the
application process, notably at Los Banos. While we have sufficient funds to
continue the pending electric study at present, we are unsure of Enron's
desires. 

As for gas interconnection issues, given the discussions about the Lodi
project extension, it would be useful to know Enron's intent with that
project also.

Thanks,

Paul Sivley

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

"Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." 

S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said Freeman, "but it's a good thing to have." 

But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said Marcus. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." 

* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

"When you compare those two contracts," Marcus said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said. 

"I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

Greetings;

I've tried to accommodate everyone's comments, but there's still a hole or two.   In addition, seems that the letter would benefit from a bit more editing to make it shorter.  Richard, note that I've left a place holder in the opening paragraph to fill in a summary of our arguments and the conditions under which we'd be willing to produce certain documents.

Best,
Jeff

Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes.
In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron.
This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions.
A story related to the deal is attached.
If you have any questions, just let me know.

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
"It took too long to bring this to resolution," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. "I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt." 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges," Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
"Let's hope cooler minds prevail," said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California," said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there," he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt "smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court." 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

Attached for your review and comment is a revised draft of the application for rehearing to be filed on Friday the 28th.  There are two primary changes.  The California Chamber of Commerce has been added to the application and an argument has been added that the Decision contradicts the most recent legislative intent expressed in ABX2 9 that direct access continue, at least for aggregation and community choice purposes.
 
Any and all comments will be very much appreciated.  Also, I would appreciate it if Sue Mara would forward the document to her contact at the Chamber so that they can also review the draft.  Thanks!

PennFuture's E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market.
---------------------------------
September 26, 2001
Vol. 3, No. 18

Straight to the Source

Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news. Importantly, the merger settlement provided $32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania.

This year, the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit, Power Team, presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania. These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement, and are not included in the $32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding.

Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East, the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms, two of which will be operational next month. The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week, and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week.

Mike Freeman, the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible, gave us some insight into Exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into America's power grids.
---------------------------------
What's in Power Team's renewable portfolio?
We have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage, 150 MW of wind, 100 MW of landfill methane, 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste, 20 MW of wood waste, and 16 MW of scrap tires.

All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as "new" resources. All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e, but only 10 MW is new generation. Of the hydro, all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards. The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e, but the biomass plant is. 

Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio?
There were two principal reasons: a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace, and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel, emissions, and cost.

Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome?
I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business. I don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases. Part of the hands-off approach was due to, I believe, a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation, not changing the power system in any way. 

Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system. For me that's the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development. I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable, and that demand for these products could be sustaining. 

Will this encourage new development? 
Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location, but is also willing to talk about additional new projects. Over time, other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same. If this chain of events occurs, I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter, just like other energy products now. 

How do renewables fit into Power Team's overall business strategy?
We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio. So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy. More specifically, we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy, not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards, but also because of natural demand. The average person may not think of it this way, but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements.  

Why Wind?
There's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements, under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects. A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998, and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year. A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years, and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand, including supply-side and demand-side solutions. We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources. 

What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal?
The first is probably the need for a long-term contract. Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price, long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period. We don't have a problem with long-term deals per se, although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well. We don't want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else. 

In my discussions with generators so far, there has been some flexibility on contract length. In fact, our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built. Beyond the long-term contract, the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating. Exelon Generation is rated A- by S&P so we are a natural counter-party for project financing. Right now, there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have. 

Will that always will be the case? 
No. If we're right about long-lasting demand, I think other large companies, including distribution companies, will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects. We've teamed up with a retail marketer, Community Energy, to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it. In the development of conventional generation, it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built. For example, a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods. And in some cases, the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing. 

Is there a financial advantage for wind?  
If one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value, a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have. Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility. This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present. 

It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term. But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project, outside of significant advances in technology. Over a long period of time, 15 or 20 years, I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite.

I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years. 

Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio?
With conventional generation and firm transmission paths, a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets, whether they are hourly, daily, monthly, or longer. Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing, amount and ultimate sink of expected output. 

The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100% of the time as possible, so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy. The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different, because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy. 

I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio. We're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix.

How does intermittent generation add complexity?
A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows, not when you flip the switch on. It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency, even for an experienced organization like ours, because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind. You don't have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand. 

In PJM, where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis, and receive (or pay) market-clearing prices depending on actual generation, wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties. An obstacle, and we're working with PJM on this right now, is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity. For purposes of regulating the system, PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate, or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand. 

This will not be practical with wind generation. We'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do. In the must-run scenario, we'd still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators. Either way, we'd have to predict output, which is a dicey 
proposition. 

Does that make wind generation unreliable?
Not at all. We've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time, such as a full year. Those predictions underlie our contracts. But it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow. The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what I've described. In PJM, a 54,000 MW system, this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now, but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives. A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system. 

The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution. 

How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind?
An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as "negative" load instead of generation. Which is to say, when the plant is generating electricity, the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating. When the plant is not generating, the load will increase. A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve. In this unique circumstance, which of the ancillary services apply to negative load, and at what level? We're working with PJM on these questions. 

I'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider. Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load, and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way. Other countries, and the western U.S. transmission systems, have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation, and so can we. 

Are you working on other approaches?
Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market, to a control area that does have such a market. The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis.  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment. However, notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach.

Will PJM resolve these problems?
Yes. PJM is progressive and innovative, and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling/imbalance issue. It's hard now because we're breaking new ground. I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed. 

How big might your renewable portfolio get? Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects? 
As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy, we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy. I'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market, such as PJM, to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output.

We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed. We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on. If we execute a contract successfully, we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company. Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. and National Wind Power. 

What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster?
We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment, standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation, financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing, and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage. 

Perhaps most importantly, we need consumers to buy the wind energy!

Secretary of State Bill Jones Calls Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the PUC to DWR Unconstitutional


Transfer Would Eliminate Public Accountability & Oversight Authority of Future Rate Increases


SACRAMENTO - Raising questions about the constitutionality of transferring rate-making authority from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to the Department of Water Resources (DWR), Secretary of State Bill Jones today expressed his outrage at the prospect of losing all public accountability and oversight of California's electricity rate-setting process.

            The PUC is expected to vote on Thursday, September 20, 2001, to accept a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer that would transfer its ratemaking authority to the DWR.  

"Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis setting rates without public oversight?" asked Jones.  "The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal.  He has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's best interest to give Gray Davis and the DWR a blank check," said Jones.        

AB1X specifies that DWR be entitled to recover the costs of its energy purchases after advising the PUC of the costs.  Most recently, DWR has informed the PUC that their purchases for energy through 2002 will reach $12.6 billion.  If the PUC accepts the draft decision, DWR will now be the state agency making the determination of whether its own purchase costs are "just and reasonable."

            "Pure and simple it's a rate scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional.  If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the DWR," said Jones.

"As our state weathers this energy challenge and faces great economic uncertainty with a budget deficit looming in the future, never before has it been so important for the PUC to responsibly perform its vital oversight duties, acting in the best interest of Californians," said former Governor George Deukmejian, who joined Jones and past PUC Commissioner Stan Hulett today in criticizing the pending PUC action.

            As a former California Attorney General, Deukmejian also expressed strong concerns regarding the legality of the PUC's abdication of authority.

            "The PUC's power to review rate increases is a power expressly granted to it in our California Constitution.  The Legislature cannot simply delegate this power to another state agency by passing a simple statute.  This transfer of power can only legally occur if a constitutional amendment is passed and AB1X is not a constitutional amendment," said Deukmejian.

            Former PUC President and Commissioner Stan Hulett also raised serious questions regarding the shift of constitutional responsibilities from the PUC to the DWR.

"Even something as seemingly innocuous as relocating the PUC's headquarters from San Francisco to Sacramento would require a constitutional amendment, according to the opinion we received from former Attorney General John Van de Camp when that issues arose some years ago," Hulett said.  "A shift of responsibility of this magnitude would clearly and unambiguously require a constitutional amendment given the enormity of the proposal."

            Secretary Jones implored the PUC to suspend action on the draft decision until these extraordinary constitutional questions are addressed.

            "California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all our sakes, and for the future of our state, we must not allow that to happen," said Jones.

Remarks by Secretary of State Bill Jones Regarding the Unconstitutional Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the Public Utilities Commission 

to the Department of Water Resources

 

(As Prepared)

 

Good morning.  

 

Thank you for being here today.  . As you know, tomorrow the California Public Utilities Commission will be voting on an extremely important issue that will affect all Californians for years to come.   

 

The PUC will consider abdicating its ratemaking responsibilities to the Department of Water Resources based upon a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer.

 

I am here today because I have grave concerns that if the PUC adopts this decision, they will be violating a major provision of California's Constitution.  

 

As California searches for ways to deal with our continuing energy situation it is incumbent upon each of us to examine the ramifications - both short and long term - of every decision we make.  This past weekend the California Legislature chose not to bring legislation affecting the pending bankruptcy of Southern California Edison because many members of the legislature believed that the legislation was severely flawed.

 

 

Let's examine for a minute why this issue and vote will be taken tomorrow.  This decision rests wholly on the new rate scheme embodied in Assembly Bill 1X (AB1X.).  

 

Since January of this year, the DWR has purchased electrical power on behalf of cash and credit poor Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  AB1X granted this authority to DWR. 

                        

            AB1X specifies that DWR is entitled to recover the cost of these purchases, and that DWR is to advise the PUC of this amount.  DWR has recently estimated that it will require $12.6 billion to cover the costs of power purchased through 2002.

 

AB1X further stipulates that the PUC will approve rates, designed by DWR and paid by the consumers, to cover DWR's expenditures for its energy purchases. Under the law, as laid out in AB1X, DWR and not the PUC will make the determination as to whether its purchase costs of $12.6 billion are "just and reasonable" under the law.             

 

Pure and simple, it is a scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional. If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the Department of Water Resources.  

 

This is a dramatic and extremely troubling break from the current role of the PUC.  For decades, the PUC has aggressively performed the vital task of oversight, through public hearings, to ensure that rates charged California's electrical energy users are "just and reasonable."  Now, that indispensable oversight authority would be delegated to a bureaucratic state agency, the DWR, with no public oversight and no independent decision making authority.

 

Do you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis' setting rates without public oversight?  The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal and he has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's interest to give Gray Davis a blank checkbook.

 

DWR and Gray Davis would become the sole arbiter of whether the cost of their own energy purchases has been "just and reasonable." Through AB1X, the Legislature has diminished the PUC's role so greatly, that its function is to simply allocate shares of the $12.6 billion revenue requirement to the three utilities.

 

This is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house - it must not happen.

 

The PUC must not vote to accept this illegal transfer of authority. The PUC must vigorously defend its role.  It must not allow the Legislature to abolish the crucial role it performs: reviewing the reasonableness of the overall purchase costs before they are passed along to ratepayers.

 

As I noted earlier, the reimbursement scheme set forth in AB1X is a violation of California's Constitution. The Legislature's attempt to strip public accountability for the reasonableness of rate increases from the PUC and give it to DWR is appalling.  Nowhere in AB1X is it specified what a reasonableness review conducted by DWR will now be. 

 

Will senior officials at DWR and Governor Davis gather at a conference table behind locked doors and declare their own power purchases reasonable? 

 

Will they hold public hearings and subject their expenditures of billions of dollars belonging to the people of California to the scrutiny of the people of California?

 

            Looking at their track record, the answer is no.

 

The PUC's power to review rate increases is not merely based on statute.  It is explicitly set out in the California Constitution. This is a very critical distinction. The Legislature cannot transfer or delegate this critical power by a simple statute. It can only be done by constitutional amendment. And AB1X is not a constitutional amendment. 

 

According to California Courts, the PUC "is not an ordinary administrative agency, but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers." Article XII, section 6, of the California Constitution states the general grant of authority for the PUC to fix rates.  

 

Section 6 provides:

 

"The commission may fix rates, establish rules, examine records, issue subpoenas, administer oaths, take testimony, punish for contempt, and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction."

 

Thus, "[t]he Constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities, including the power to fix rates, establish rules, hold various types of hearings, award reparation, and establish its own procedures." This is basic California law, reaffirmed time after time by our courts.  

 

These constitutional powers are based firmly on the authority to make factual inquiry into the reasonableness of the rates to be fixed.  In one notable case, PG&E v. Railroad Comm., the federal court reviewed natural gas rates set by the Railroad Commission, predecessor to the PUC.  The court discussed the duties of the ratemaking body to make sure that the rates it fixes be "reasonable." 

 

Because the PUC has the authority to "fix rates," it therefore has a corollary duty to make sure that the rates it fixes are reasonable.  

 

This must mean that there is a constitutional duty and right to examine the costs underlying those rates.  AB1X cannot alter or eliminate that duty.  AB1X also cannot strip the core component of any reasonableness review: the close and open-minded examination of those facts being used to justify a rate increase.

 

The Legislature cannot deny the PUC these constitutional powers.  

 

By depriving the PUC the authority to examine underlying costs in the exercise of its duty to "fix rates," the Legislature has improperly sought to modify, curtail and abridge the constitutional powers of the PUC.  To that extent, AB1X is invalid and unconstitutional.

 

            In a startling break with California's past history, AB1X allows DWR to retain title to the energy it purchases and then "resell" it directly to consumers. The utilities then collect the energy costs from their retail customers and return to DWR the portion of the revenues DWR has said it must have as reimbursement.

 

            By any other name, this is a tax. It is an enormous sum of money being paid out by the people of California.

 

            According to our courts, the power to set taxes is a legislative function.  DWR is an agency within the executive branch of government. 

 

            The California Constitution specifies that the powers of one branch shall not be exercised by another branch. 

 

The following example highlights the impropriety of the Legislature's delegation of authority to DWR to determine the reasonableness of its own energy purchases.  

 

            The Legislature assesses California's highway and transportation needs and then sets the rate for the gasoline tax. Drivers purchasing gas in California pay the tax, on a cents per gallon basis, whenever they buy gas. The Legislature cannot delegate to CalTrans the authority both to determine its own highway construction budget and to set a gasoline tax rate calculated to fund that budget. 

 

This situation is identical to DWR. The Legislature has directed DWR to purchase power, as it needs, at prices it is willing to pay. The Legislature has further directed the PUC to authorize rates, without any review to determine their reasonableness, in order to reimburse DWR.

 

The PUC cannot legally - and must not under any circumstances -- abdicate its responsibilities to the people of California.    

 

This is a decision based on the unconstitutional scheme laid out in AB1X, and it's unconscionable for the PUC to vote away its own most precious function: providing accountability for just and reasonable rates for the people of California.

 

For these reasons, I cannot urge in stronger terms that the PUC take the following actions tomorrow on the draft decision:

 

1.      Suspend action on the draft decision until the extraordinary constitutional questions are resolved 

2.      Seek immediate resolution of these constitutional questions by initiating a lawsuit against the Legislature and the Governor 

3.      Adopt regulatory and statutory changes to ensure that public oversight and accountability for just and reasonable rates continues

 

            California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all of our sakes, and the future of our state, this must not be allowed to happen.

Playboy Online staff cutbacks

Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in 
its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As 
part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media 
company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. 
Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six 
months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its 
service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can 
look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we 
look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it 
well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.

Hi Doug:
Hope all is well.  Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with the PUC.  Must be a relief. 

 I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?  Appreciate your insights.

AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!  What next?

Best,

See story below.

State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale 
California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis. 
The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. 
And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. 
With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. 
The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said. 
"We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11." 
Now, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. 
Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. 
The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. 
But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. 
With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. 
This year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. 
But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. 
Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. 
"I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. 
Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. 
The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. 
But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. 
Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. 
Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. 
"It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. 
As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. 
"There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said. 
The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. 
The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. 
Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated." 
Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year."

Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.  Sure that  errors remain, but this version should at least be somewhat closer.  Changes are in strike-out-underline.

We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

Best,
Jeff

Steve --

We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

I spoke with Mary Lynne today, and she said that once upon a time (after the PX expired) we filed something asking the CPUC to make the DJ index a substitute for the PX credit.  Does this ring a bell?  And the more important question -- did we ever withdraw that request?  Thanks.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

April:  Could you please distribute this to the office?  Thanks a bunch.

Greetings Folks:

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

Best,
Jeff

Well, it was too brief, and I didn't get to work with you nearly as much as I'd hoped. But when I did, it was very enjoyable.  All the best.  These are strange and unsettling days, but it seems that the best among us always land on their feet, so I'm sure that's where you'll end up.  Take care and hope to cross paths again soon.

Greetings Eve and Bill:
This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a) maintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.  We hope that you can join.
 
All the best,
Jeff

Subject: Draft Application for Rehearing


Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue of retroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state and federal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtood weekend!

PG&E Gas Accord--$10K
PUC proceeding to consider continuing PG&E's "Gas Accord."  The Gas Accord is PG&E's program to unbundle its backbone transmission and storage systems.  The program began in 1998 and will expire Q4/2002.
Sempra (SoCalGas) System Unbundling--$10K
Though PG&E's system has been unbundled since 1998, SoCalGas' system remains bundled.  The PUC has pressured SoCalGas to emulate PG&E's restructured system.
ENA Origination Support (Getting info from Tycholiz)--$$XXK
Rate related proceedings (PG&E/Sempra)--$1.5K
Every two years, the utilities are required to file with the PUC any price changes it desires to make.  These price changes can have a direct financial effect on ENA's, TW's and EES' business.
ENA power plant support--$2.5K
ENA Western Origination is developing numerous gas-fired power plants in California.  ENA seeks GA support in order to obtain gas services for those plants.
Transwestern infrastructure and origination support--$2.5K
Transwestern is either considering, or in the early stages of, developing additional pipeline infrastrastructure in California.
CFEE Board Dues--$15K

We need to start figuring out as soon as possible:
What we want to accomplish at the hearing.
What our posture/message will be.
What to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond.
What to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond.
How to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference.
How to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts (e.g., PG&E bankruptcy and Edison negotiations)

Sue and I can take the call from this end, and presumably Mike and Jeanne you can team up in a room on your end, so we can conference everyone in using our phones.  Please let me know if this works for everyone.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,

Jeff, received your message for a Tues AM meeting in Sacramento... I can make that. Also, I will try to see SMUD while I am there and plan on seeing PG& E back in the city. Any word from SOCALED.

FYI. Pretty good letter from large customers urging the PUC to vote down the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC. With Loretta announcing today (and signaling to the Republicans on the Commission) that she'll be voting no on the rate agreement tomorrow, it looks like Davis and Angelides are in for a bad day.  Sort of chokes you up.

Best,
Jeff

FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.

Attached is the strawman.  Note that the Sheet 2--drops participation to bare essentials.  Sheet 3 assumes a 40% budget cut from Sheet 1.   The deleted actions are different in Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.  

Jeff:  Please review ASAP, add the gas matters to Sheet 1, delete gas matters that are not essential in Sheet 2, and take a 40% haircut in Sheet 3.  Also add back any other matters that I have deleted that you disagree with, but make sure that Sheet 3 continues to meet the 40% haircut target.  Then send to Sue Mara for review.  

Sue:  Please review ASAP after Jeff.  I need to get this into Rick by Wednesday.

FYI.  Suggested addressing it to Angelides, but they didn't want to "dignify" his letter.  They decided that, ultimately, Loretta's in charge, and addressed it to her.  Had a great talk with Sarah.  She's following up on a few things.  You may want to touch base with her re: hearings on DWR rev. req.  You ever received my (modest) edits to the Karl Wood letter?

We should determine whether we want to voice an opinion on this.  Seems there would be two issues  that might concern us:  1) bankruptcy and 2) effect on our book.  Might be useful to discuss briefly; perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.  Thoughts?

Cmmr. Bilas issued an alternate yesterday on the suspension of direct
access.  The draft is for informational purposes only -- no comments are
allowed.

Essentially the draft updates his alternate from June.  It does not suspend
direct access but opens a proceeding addressing issues surrounding the
suspension. The alternate contains some good language slamming DWR and its
potentially high price contracts.

I do not have an electronic version of the  alternate.  Let me know if you

?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

You aren't supposed to be hungry.  Dinner won't be served until 10pm.  Be
hungry at 10.

We leave for NY on the 1st and return on the 11th.  Staying at the Waldorf
the entire time.

Three dates.  OK.  Wait.  How about two dates?  November 15th (any time) or
November 22nd  (any time)??

I think the menus will be good also.  I think my mom has had their food and
liked it too.

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change,
modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one
works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the
riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe
you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK,
of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the
event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other
stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

Circuit Breaker: Enron Dumps CFO Amid Conflict Questions

By Stephen Taub

Enron Corp. is set to replace CFO Andrew Fastow. As CFO.com reported in a
story earlier this week, Fastow's role in a limited partnership has raised
concerns about a conflict of interest. 

Fastow is succeeded by Jeff McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and
CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was
Enron's treasurer. He resigned that post in part because he disapproved of
Fastow's role in running two partnerships, according to The Wall Street
Journal. 

"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as
CFO," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO, in a statement. 

McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office
as CFO for the company's European operations. Upon returning to the United
States, McMahon assumed the post of EVP of finance and treasurer for Enron
Corp. In 2000, he was named president and COO of Enron Net Works, where he
focused on E-commerce activities. 

As reported on Friday, The Wall Street Journal said a limited partnership
organized by Fastow, who has been Enron's CFO since 1997, racked up millions
of dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company. 

On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

On October 16, Enron stunned Wall Street when it announced that it would
take a $1.01 billion after-tax charge for the September 30 quarter. 

Since the announcement, Enron's share price has more than halved. 

Fastow's dismissal seems to be an about-face for Enron. In a conference call
Tuesday, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to
assure that there was no conflict as Fastow played both roles. Enron has
since dissolved the partnerships. 

"Obviously, the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there
would be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed
certain methods for it to be dealt with ... so Enron would never be
compromised," Lay said in published accounts. "We are very concerned [at]
the way Andy's character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles,
as well as the company's reputation." 

Predictably, on Wednesday at least two law firms - Stull, Stull & Brody and
Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, L.L.P - filed class-action suits against
Enron, Lay, Fastow, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief
executive who resigned in August. 

The suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information
that materially misstated the company's condition and prospects to the
investing public. Moreover, the suits argue that the company failed to
disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not
misleading. 

The complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning
its business, financial results, and operations which failed to disclose,
among other things: 

* The company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining
demand for bandwidth, and the company's efforts to create a trading market
for bandwidth were not meeting with success, as many of the market
participants were not creditworthy. 

* The company's operating results were materially overstated, since Enron
failed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with
certain limited partnerships - the partnerships that were managed by Fastow.


* Enron was failing to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in
accordance with GAAP.

Thanks. You're call.  Might be a good idea to talk with him in advance.  Let me know what you think. Or, given the time crunch, just contacting his office to find out what his angle will be would be helpful--I also assume he'll spend his time 1) singing PA's praises and 2) claiming that DA can work, if done right, both of which are great messages.

Best,
Jeff

Glenn Thomas was the chief guy in the Gov office during PECO but was relatively quiet.  He is now the Chair of the PaPUC.  He will probably just discuss how wonderful a job PA is doing.  I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif.  If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

thanks.  I think "hump day" is putting it mildly.  You see in the press that we approached (are still approaching?) KKR?  And that Buffet ain't interested?  What a world.

Someone in real estate finance I know compared what Fastow & Co. did to the FirstPlus fiasco.  That hurt.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right."
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

Best,
Jeff

I'll be in the office very shortly.  My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling:
 

he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit
he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to "cooperate" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers

I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.  He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.

Michael:  I call you soon as I get in--next 15-30 minutes.

 

Best,

Jeff

reliant guy, mike jines, called me about the deal with the cpuc. he thinks they will get injured and that sce will just continue the same path of doing nothing for the generators and the marketers.
he wants to talk mid-morning houston time after we've digested for our view.
with the settlement of the filed rate case, what does that do for us re the ctc claim? presumably they would pay as there would be no argument not to. am i in the right place? i hate to be too logical here. jeff saw your earlier email re your discussions but i've been in another crisis. need to decide what to do tomorrow, or, i realize, TODAY, AS IT IS NOW AFTER MIDNIGHT. michael, can you get with jeff early and start getting  our view as i finish the other crisis stuff first in the am???

Doesn't look good.

USA: Shares of NewPower plummet in midday trade.

10/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity provider NewPower Holdings were down almost 20 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, but the company had no comment on the share drop. 
Shares of NewPower were down 55 cents, or 17.9 percent, to $2.53 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
"We don't comment on stock activity. We are reporting our earnings in November," said Gael Doar, spokeswoman for NewPower. 
NewPower, which bills itself as the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers, recently became the outside provider with the greatest share for competitive energy providers as part of the Texas's deregulation.

Subject:	CSC DASR Bandwidth, and Utility Deadlines

Nancy, when we went through our last big DASR emergency week before last, the question was raised as to what was the effective date of a DASR, e.g., is it midnight of the day that you've submitted it, or if the utility picks up the information from their file server at 5:00 p.m. (SoCal) is does that determine the effective date such that anything submitted later would have an effective date of the following day?  Could you give us some guidance on the right answer?  We used the pickup time of the utility, in which case we had to have all the SCE DASRs submitted by about 3:00 Houston time to give CSC the ability to key the data into their system and run their batch process prior to SCE's pickup time.

To clarify below.  The 3:00 cutoff for SCE DASRs will not allow for 480 SCE accounts.  CSC has stated they could do about 120 in an hour.  I have indicated it below in a revision.   The 480 would apply to a group of DASRs from all utilities.  Additionally, CSC has stated that from 6:00 forward, the amounts shown below are guesses of what they can do, but there is a lack of certainty.

Subject:	Dissent from Commissioners Bilas and Duque Opposing Suspension of DA



 Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout," said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  "And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders." =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=
0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=
ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20

?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=
iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=
shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=
tility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=
 lines and cables.
The new gas transmission business will be a California company established =
to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=
y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=
s storage facilities. =20
Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=
ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=
ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =
for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=
e provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=
risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =
Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=
s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20
Glynn said, "This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=
able and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=
 company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =
generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=
 to pay creditors."
The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=
f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=
 and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=
ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=
nization.=20
"We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=
 do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs," said =
Glynn.  "We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=
he people who know how to run them best."
In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=
stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=
te.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=
 for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=
bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=
esources.
The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =
be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20
Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=
rs, said "This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=
esolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=
ull support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=
r 11 process."=20
"With this plan filed," said Glynn, "we are now focused on bringing the Cha=
pter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw=
orthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=
s' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders."

This release contains forward looking statements about the proposed plan of=

Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all of th=

f confirmed, it will become effective, some of the factors that could affec=
t the outcome materially include: the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi=
ngs; the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified; legislative and r=
egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect=
ric and natural gas industries in the United States, particularly in Califo=
rnia; whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or =
whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all; risks re=
lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated =
entities, including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial=
 projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe=
d claims, and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due =
to, among other reasons, an adverse change in market conditions or in the c=
ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings; =
whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to pre-empt relevant n=
on-bankruptcy law and if so, whether and the extent to which such assertion=
 of jurisdiction is successfully challenged; whether a favorable tax ruling=
 or opinion is obtained regarding the tax-free nature of the internal restr=
ucturings and  spin off contemplated by the Plan; and the ability of the Ut=
ility to successfully disaggregate its businesses;=20

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
"It took too long to bring this to resolution," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. "I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt." 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges," Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
"Let's hope cooler minds prevail," said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California," said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there," he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt "smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court." 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with execs may not have occured yet.  nevertheless, you'll have a darned good idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?

anywho, let's see what response i get back.  maybe they'll want to push back.

her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place previously).  now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even more gorgeous (if that's possible).

OK, so the oct 15th date is a little too early.  The pilot review with execs
at enron is at the end of the month.  SO, we should target early November
for this meeting.  Can you help facilitate that?

What did you think of PP's hair.  I was shocked.  It looked really good!

I pushed this date way out.  We can easily push it out more. Jeff fully
understands that we want to schedule this meeting after the pilot has been
completed (not get in the way, see the real value of the system
first...etc.).  My question to you is when is the pilot scheduled to be
completed so I have a time frame on when these discussions might take place.

Thanks,

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project-we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES-acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time-the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

By Jason Leopold=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

Generators, including Mirant Corp. ( MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investm=
ents/quotes/?symbol=3DMIR>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/new=

p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought app=
arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

   California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel T=
aub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray=
 Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric=
ity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a=
 misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power pur=
chases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Da=
vis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on=
 the office's press list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state p=
ower purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contract=
s. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market i=
nvoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed=
 through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w=
hich are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of=
 the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t=
he day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  Accord=
ing to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity =
for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li=
ght 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $14=
9.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura=
te.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me=
gawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloombe=
rg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a=
ccording to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on=
 the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma=
rket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str=
ategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legis=
lators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft=
er they are signed.  =09

California Retailers Association Supports PG&E Reorganization Plan
SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- California Retailers Association today released the following statement on Pacific Gas and Electric Company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy: 
"The California Retailers Association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to California, its consumers, and its businesses." 
"We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal." 
"We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time." 
"Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives." 
The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores. Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually.

FYI.  Please keep confidential and do not circulate.  This is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the Angelides tantrum.  Only the large customers will sign, however.  I'll forward the final when they've completed it	.  Sue's working on ARM to do something akin from the suppliers side.

Best,

For this week, we'd like to cancel both the Tuesday and Thursday calls and instead reschedule to Wednesday at 9 AM PDT (11 AM CDT).   We'll try to use the same call-in number. Scott, could you let Ken know of the plan?

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: TURN Comments on DWR Decision


As you know, a draft decision was issued a few days ago by ALJ Pulsiver regarding the DWR revenue requirement.  Attached are TURN's comments.  The introduction gives a cogent summary of the consumer group's view of DWR's demands:
 
"TURN continues to believe that CDWR has grossly inflated its revenue requirement by billions of dollars through the use of extremely high gas prices and ridiculously high ancillary service costs that are unrelated to current market conditions.  We understand that CDWR has the right under the Water Code to completely ignore consumer interests, recognize that it has done so in this case, and have come to expect that the Department will continue to do so.  CDWR, not the Commission, is the cause of a revenue requirement that is probably bloated by as much as $2 billion of unnecessary costs."
 
TURN also concludes that the Draft Decision places too much of a burden on PG&E and advocates that the "Commission should also adopt TURN's weighted load method of allocating ancillary services among utilities so that PG&E's extensive self-provision of ancillary services is not siphoned off to benefit other utilities."
Its suggested rates are shown on the following table:

Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:

Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Best,
Jeff

"Trading Inefficiencies in California's Electricity Markets" (October 2001)
         PWP-086 by Severin Borenstein, James Bushnell, Christopher R. 
Knittel, and Catherine Wolfram


         We study price convergence between the two major markets for 
wholesale electricity in California from their deregulation in April 1998 
through November 2000, nearly the end of trading in one market.  We would 
expect profit-maximizing traders to have eliminated persistent price 
differences between the markets.  Institutional impediments and traders' 
incomplete understanding of the markets, however, could have delayed or 
prevented price convergence.  We find that the two benchmark electricity 
prices in California - the Power Exchange's day-ahead price and the 
Independent System Operator's real-time price - differed substantially 
after the markets opened but then appeared to be converging by the 
beginning of 2000.  Starting in May 2000, however, price levels and price 
differences increased dramatically.  We consider several explanations for 
the significant price differences and conclude that rapidly changing market 
rules and market fundamentals, including one buyer's attempt to exercise a 
form of monopoly power, made it difficult for traders to take advantage of 
opportunities that ex post appear to have been profitable.

Unless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning.  
 
I'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however.  We'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in, for that matter. 
 
Reliant and Mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up.  They would of course love to have Enron "lead the charge."  I would recommend that we not play that card right now and let Reliant and Mirant go forward if they choose.
 
Best,
Jeff

Subject:        Call to SCE Regarding Negative CTC Credits 

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication 

Steve, 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our "Negative CTC Credits" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss. 

Thanks.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

For anyone who hasn't seen it already, attached is an electronic version of California's PUC's decision to suspend DA.  Also attached at the end of the order is a very strong dissent signed by Commissioners Bilas and Duque.

Just so we're clear.  To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of "community aggregation,"  and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.  In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.

Best,
Jeff

According to Assembly Member Migden's office, if enacted, they believe ABX2
9 does provide the CPUC with adequate direction to address community
aggregation separate from other forms of direct access.  They have also had
conversations with the Treasurer's office who informed them that as written,
the Treasurer does not believe ABX2 9 would pose a problem for the bonds.
That said, they have still not received any indication from the Governor's
office as to whether or not he will sign the measure into law so they have
not had conversations with the CPUC.

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Jeff,

I apologize for the delay.  I am still waiting on a few pieces to complete the very generic presentations we discussed this morning.  As soon as it is somewhat together I will shoot you a copy.

Let's go ahead and do a call.  Good time for the 3 of us to catch up on what we've been up to (unless Alan and Sue are strongly opposed).  But no need to set up a formal agenda.

Greetings:

First, thanks for the pizza.  

Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 

"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 

The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 

The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 

CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. 

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

Hey, buddie.  Mike and Sue still differ.  We're getting the transcript to verify.  I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.  They both agreed.  Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in.  Let me know if this works for you.  (Please be easy with Sue, she's pretty tense.)

yes, they already told Dan Douglas they would sign a stipulation that
replaced the MOU wit the Edison-CPUC settlement.  That is more than doable.
Dan is drafting the new stipulation now.  The stipulation commits SCE to pay
once the conditions precedent are met:  1. implementation of the settlement,
and 2. approval of the advice letter on prospective calculation of the
generation credit.  Our only current beef with that is that they exclude the
DWR charges.  Mike

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," Davis told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. 
"Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
"This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
"There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. 
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.

The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).  There continues to be debates over the specifics.  Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.  If you have any questions, give a holler.

LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date.
In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.

No problem.  To be honest, I was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that I might step in something unintentionally.  Please let me know if I do/did.  Also, keep in touch with how the issues go with them, since they are clearly trying to use the reg. issues as leverage, and in that regard, often offering up worst-case scenarios.

Quick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.

Subject:	RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:

1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."

Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.

Best,
Jeff

WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's a=
pproach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle w=
ants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other init=
iatives popular with Democrats.  Daschle's aides and party strategists say =
the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, d=
raw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation an=
d alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' cha=
rges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both side=
s see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sig=
n. =09
=09
   "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you g=
o with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people act=
ually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  De=
mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.=
 Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus=
h is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R=
epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and =
gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w=
ith support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House sou=
ndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an=
 opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," sa=
id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy=
 came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c=
ommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum =
wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth=
er issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic=
y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican =
issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President =
Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th=
e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ=
y needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden =
to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce=
nt end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp=
oke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for =
the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N=
ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm=
ittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I=
t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in =
May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex=
t week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme=
nt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin=
g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne=
ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped =
defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac=
k its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain o=
ver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of =
Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte=
rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a=
lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants=
 that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati=
on and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor=
t utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo=
my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi=
s month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle =
extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ=
icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co=
llins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc=
Cain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights=
 and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio=
n measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobb=
ling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe=
llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a=
dviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc=
ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment=
ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it=
s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend=
ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als=
o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp=
ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the=
 president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee=
ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials=
 say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ=
y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas=
kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f=
or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr=
oval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t=
he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin=
g blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and =
last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call=
 for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue =
and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui=
ck solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a polit=
ical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Lik=
e the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, e=
nergy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.  =09

Carole Migden indicated that they were going to meet again on Tuesday.  I
followed up with Keith prior to Appropriations and he was very disappointed
that he and Bill Leonard could not round up more votes. They knew the
liberals would make a play and thought on a policy level they were better
off pushing a better bill than allowing a bad bill to go through along party
lines.  However, Republicans are well aware of the polling and think this
issue is better left to the Democrats.  Perhaps the liberal play will
energize Republican members.  As for moving to the left, it did not appear
as if Hertzberg was moving left because the amendments seemed to be offered
without his consent which is why the hearing was stopped so abruptly.  If in
fact they are going to stay left and the amendments they presented this
morning wind up in the bill, what does Enron think?  I have already
forwarded the DA amendments to Jeff, Jim and Mike Day.  I will send the
additional amendments momentarily.

Thanks, Scott.  Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan,
centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small.  Richmond
(Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with
Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles
between Rs and Ds.  In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds
drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to
make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.  Scott, are they
meeting again on  Monday, or Tuesday?

The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing
mid-way
through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before,
with
the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats
crafted
11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner
their
votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or
leadership
on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.

By Jason Leopold=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought app=
arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

****************************************************
PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal
Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.
SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.

With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.

Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.

Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."

Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.

Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.

And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.

For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.

Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as "nonexistent."

But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.

Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."

A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.

Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.

She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing."

"Before, I was on [Davis'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."

Critics, including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.

Insisting on Independence

Accounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.

Starting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison, Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. Davis had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.

Lynch was another skeptic; Davis' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate Edison. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.

Davis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill.

The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.

Lynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edison's debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers.

It was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.

"When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.

At her direction, PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison.

Edison, PUC Started Secret Talks

Edison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.

But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.

The PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."

Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edison's problem.

Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with Edison.

"If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."

For several days, however, Lynch did not inform Davis. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.

On Sept. 25, some of Davis' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.

That same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.

Over the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.

"It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney Ron Olson, an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.

While those negotiations were going on, Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.

The issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers.

Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.

The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque.

The governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.

But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson.

Commissioners Praise Lynch

In Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.

"There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.

Brown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.

"She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of Davis' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.

"I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."

Calif Power Consultant Failed To Reveal Energy Co. Stake


By JASON LEOPOLD

   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES -- A top energy consultant hired by to negotiate long-term power contracts for the state of California failed to disclose that he held stock in a company with which the state signed a $1 billion power supply pact last month, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

Vikram Budraja filed an amended financial disclosure form Aug. 13 listing holdings of between $2,000 and $10,000 in stock in ScottishPower (SPI), whose subsidiary PacifiCorp Power Marketing signed a $1 billion, 10-year power contract with the state Department of Water Resources on July 6.

Budraja failed to disclose the information in a form he filed in July, after energy consultants hired by Gov. Gray Davis came under fire for failing to file routine financial disclosure forms.

Budraja's August economic disclosure form states that he sold his ScottishPower shares July 30 on the advice of his lawyer. He purchased the shares "pre-96," according to the form.

Davis's office has sent a copy of Budraja's amended filing to the state's Fair Political Practices Committee for review, said Bill Kissinger, Deputy Legal Affairs adviser for Davis.

The FPPC is conducting an investigation into a handful of the DWR's consultants who held stock in energy companies while working on behalf of the state buying power and negotiating contracts, Kissinger said.

The DWR, which is handling the job of buying power in lieu of California's insolvent utilities, said Budraja didn't negotiate the contract with PacifiCorp. The department disclosed the contract on Aug. 17.

Stephen Kaufman, a lawyer representing the Electric Power Group and Budraja, also said Budraja didn't help negotiate the contract. Kaufman added that Budraja's ScottishPower holdings were tied up in an IRA and that Budraja hadn't even realized he held stock in the company until a review of his financial records was undertaken recently.

"A decision was made upon reviewing all of Mr. Budraja's assets to disclose this to the public given all the activities going on and the press accounts," Kaufman said. "The signing of the contract was of no consequence in deciding whether or not it should be sold. This was a very small holding that was part of an IRA purchased prior to 1996. He did not remember or realize he had this holding until after this situation blew up and took a look at all of his holdings."

     Political Battle Continues

Budraja included the following comment with his renewed filing:

"The information contained in the two previously filed form 700s was provided pursuant to a series of instructions provided by the Department of Water Resources starting on June 15, 2001, that my disclosure should reflect the facts that existed on the date you first began working for the California Energy Resources Scheduling," Budraja wrote, referring to the Department of Water Resources' power-buying arm. "This amended form is filed to list information not previously provided based upon consultation with and advice of legal counsel regarding the disclosure required by the Political Reform Act."

The disclosure is the latest in a battle over possible conflicts of interest waged by Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis, a Democrat, next year for governor.

Jones began pressing consultants hired by Davis' administration in July to disclose their shareholdings in energy companies. Once they did, Jones asked federal and state regulators to investigate possible insider trading and conflicts of interest.

Budraja, a former Edison International (EIX) vice president, is one of the state's two main power-contract negotiators. Electric Power Group is under contract to plan and execute the DWR's power purchases and to help coordinate between the agency and other state offices. His firm has 10 employees under contract to the DWR. Electric Power Group is to receive $6.2 million for those services through Dec. 31, 2002.

As reported, investigators with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Budraja's shareholdings. The consultant has confirmed receiving a letter from the SEC informing him of the inquiry and asking him to supply information regarding his investments as of Jan. 1.

In July, Budraja disclosed holding in Edison International and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), both of which he sold after he began working for the state.

The state's contract with PacifiCorp was negotiated by Richard Ferreira, the former Sacramento Municipal Utility District executive, and a representative from Navigant consulting, said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.

Ferreira was fired in late July because he held stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN) while negotiating long-term contracts with the company, according to Davis' office.

The Republican leadership in the state Legislature has called for oversight hearings into the state's $43 billion in long-term power contracts, as well as its spot-market purchases. The Democratic majority has yet to respond to the request.

Greetings.  Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:

As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.
In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.
(I'd ask, "what next?", but I'm afraid to ask.....)
However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.
OK, back to Enron.
It's a mess (surprise).
I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears.
Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.
We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.
Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.
This week's a little tough just because with school and "the mess," I'm a tad preoccupied.
HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.

Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.

Best,
Jeff

Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie.  You know that I've really come to love that crazy dog, and it meant a lot that you and Eldon were always so caring.  She is truly a lovely dog and I'll miss her immensely, but it helps that everyone was so loving.  And I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there for her today, but the Enron thing is really a mess and I've got responsibilities on that front that I just can't pass off. Thanks again so much for everything.

Hugs,
Jeff

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Subject: PICKS OF THE WEEK - WEEK 1


Welcome back all of you veteran pickers!  I'd like to introduce our three
new rookies:

The Deitrick's - Val and Scott - from napa
Andy Bledsoe - from Napa
Kent Deverell - from San Francisco

Good luck to all!!

Steve McCarthy is not in the pool this year (we'll miss his bazaar picks)
and we aren't sure if Carlton is still in.  If he is, we'll have a total of
27; if not it'll be 26.  We'll send out a completed report of the projected
payouts before the first week of the season starts.

Attached are two Excel files.  The first one just has the pick sheet for
week #1


One easy way to submit the weekly picks is to:
1)	Click on this sheet and open it in Excel
2)	Fill in the information at the top
3)	Make your weekly picks by putting numbers in the cell with the line under
it by the team you want to pick.  (This will also give you a check figure at
the bottom to be sure you have gotten, at least,  the correct total - not
necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file
5)	Use "FORWARD" to get the e-mail back to me at eldon@direcpc.com
6)	If you use "REPLY" the attachment does not get sent

It really makes a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to do the
statistical work if you use this form so we really appreciate getting your
picks this way.

Here is an Excel workbook that contains a tab for every week - so all 17
weeks are here plus a sample.  However, all you need to send back is the
sheet for the current week.  Just to make it easier, (or in case you've
misplaced the attachment) we'll send out, via e-mail, each upcoming week's
pick sheet in time for you to make your selections.   If you have any
questions about Excel please give me a call at (707) 255-4813 or call Nancy
at (707) 251-4870.

Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

Hey, I was wrong. I went back and checked.  DA got as high as about 16% of total load in May 2000.  On January 1 (contracry to Herr Angelides' letter), DA was about 7.3% of load.  On February 1 it was 3.5%.

Hello:

First, forget it all and have a wonderful holiday.

Second, given the immense challenges, I've been instructed to get major expenses in and paid.  So I sent to Rick in a confidential folder my tuition reimbursement form for school.  Do you know if he got it?

Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.


Thanks,
Delaney

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."
He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 30-60 minutes.  Thanks to Delaney for all the work.

Best,
Jeff

Playboy Online staff cutbacks

Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in 
its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As 
part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media 
company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. 
Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six 
months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its 
service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can 
look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we 
look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it 
well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.

?	The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
?	The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
?	But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
?	How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
?	The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).

Firms Push Edison Near Bankruptcy


Energy: Power generators ask firm to spell out how they will be repaid hundreds of millions of dollars for purchases under deregulation plan.

By NANCY VOGEL and JERRY HIRSCH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

September 29 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Five big energy companies owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Southern California Edison pushed the utility a step closer to bankruptcy Friday by asking Edison to sign an agreement spelling out how each will be repaid.

The companies demanded that Edison meet with them within two weeks to work out a repayment plan and implied that otherwise they would drag the Rosemead-based utility into Bankruptcy Court. Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.

The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.

The letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers.

"This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such," says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles.

"We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, "but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question.

"Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement," Bates wrote.

The five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.

Edison officials refused to comment.

The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.

Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion.

"Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.

A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. "It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us," Patrick Dorinson said.

So far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.

Davis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.

Other Creditors Take Notice

Senate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.

The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue.

"From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over," said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.

Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court.

"By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first," Moorlach said.

But Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE.

"We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy," Lawrence said.

Edison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.

By January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.

Edison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.

The generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.

Shares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Subject:	SCE Negative CTC Claim

Mike Day believes that SCE might agree to a new Stipulation in which they commit to pay our claim if their new deal and their pending Advice Letter are approved by the CPUC.  I have scheduled a call for tomorrow at 12:30 CST to discuss the terms we would like to see in the Stipulation (e.g., drop approval of the Advice Letter as a condition, payment within 10 days after CPUC approval, agreement on the number set forth in our response to their Data Request, agreement to apply accrued negative CTC credits to current T&D charges, to name a few).   On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement.

Let's try this.  It's all inter-related.  PG&E, the prehearing conference and our workout with Edison.  Can we have one call that you includes all who need to be involved?  (I'm thinking, Steffes, you, Tribolet, me. Mellencamp, Wanda, Sue). That make sense?

Let me know.  Easiest thing would  likely be to set up a call-in number (I'm mobile today).  Thanks alot.

Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.

Subject:	Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

This memo from Angelides outlines what has happened and what still needs to
happen at the PUC before bonds can be issued.  He mentions that no appeals
to the DA suspension have yet been filed but that the deadline has not yet
passed.  When are we filing our appeal? I'd like to send out a news release
the morning we file the appeal if AReM agrees.

On another matter, just so we're all on the same page, Norm and I produced
the letter to Davis and legislative leadership which you all received
yesterday for final approval.  The Weintraub column handout has also been
mocked up and Norm is going to pick that up this morning from our office.

An attorney for Reliant sent a letter on behalf of five Southern California Edison creditors (Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron, Puget Sound Energy) to SCE today requesting a meeting to discuss the terms of a forbearance agreement.  The following is the statement we are using with the media:


We are interested in getting paid and in discussing constructive solutions.  This letter is aimed at advancing that.  We have no plans at this time to participate as a petitioning creditor in an involuntary bankruptcy filing.  In fact, this letter is an attempt to avoid bankruptcy.

Jim:

Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:

1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE
2) Edison "meet and confer" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.

2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.

We have a number yet for the call?

Best,
Jeff

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.

The writer fails of course to mention that Clinton (with bi-partisan support) bombed the shit out of bin laden after the embassy attacks.  Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think the families of the victims

Today, Dress Wounds.  Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)
by Michael Rectenwald


<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>
 
 
At this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the
heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in
need, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the
immediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to
address, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and
spiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all
suffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let
us suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of
our fellow human beings.

Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both
have arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding
members, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.
Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had "arms, legs,
and parts of people falling on our heads." Our nation is poorer, our lives
are lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.

We who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find
ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally
behind a leader who we know is not our leader, a "leader" who has, we
believe, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our
nation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger
towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --
unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --
is justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and
abroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault
on our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst
act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.
We do not think that this attack under Bush's "command" represents a
meaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that
"inescapable web of mutuality" that Martin Luther King referred to. There
was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative
consequences in and for the world.

The Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to
the ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been
exacerbated by the "laissez faire" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that
Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship
the situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,
the world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's
international policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and
treaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at
the present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address
a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable
pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.
Let's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to
those nearest us.

Therefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some
restraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at
the ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.
Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not
help either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and
alienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered
from this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe
harbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate "captain."   Our
commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a
deeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will
then be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the
right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best
interests of our nation at heart.

Let us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our
own, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too
much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.

Sincerely,

Maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the Hyatt to the Burbank airport Monday morning.  My flight arrives on Southwest  (from Oakland) at about 8 AM.  I've rented a car.  Then we can drive to Edison from there (it's about 30 minutes from the airport), east of Pasadena on 10.  Then I can drive you back with me from Rosemead and you can catch a cab from Burbank to LAX.  Should be pretty easy that way.

Subject:	RE: Regulatory Updates - General Updates


Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

regards, 

Barry Tycholiz

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

I have a new description of PG&E's reorg plan-- it is the ultimate
expression of their longstanding affliction with Enron-envy.  Now that
they're cutting loose the UDC/LDC, they can fall flat on their faces with
no safety net (except the hydro, of course).   MIKE

I'll check on reviving the unbundling, but I think they've begged off of that for now.  In their most recent BCAP, they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone.  You have that proposal?  And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.  I can check on that.

I was talking to one of my customers yesterday, and they said that Southern California Gas Co. recently made a filing to revive unbundling of their system.  Can you tell me if that is true .  Also can you tell me what the status is regarding Socal Gas purchasing natural gas for the  needs of SDGE's customers.  My customers tell me that is probably going to happen as well.

Subject: PG&E's Gas Accord II application 
Importance: High 


Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an 
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the 
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order 
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II" 
application. 

If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415) 
973-8677.

For this week, we'd like to cancel both the Tuesday and Thursday calls and instead reschedule to Wednesday at 9 AM PDT (11 AM CDT).   We'll try to use the same call-in number. Scott, could you let Ken know of the plan?

Please let me know if this change presents a problem for anyone.

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff

 << File: PX Summary 091401.xls >> 

Jeff,

I have attached a file showing the SCE receivable amount of ($109,292,004.75) Due Enron.  This amount is net of the payments made by SCE.  A few cautions, these amounts are reported more by Enron accounting month vs. utility bill cycle month.  But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. 

To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date. 

Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  FYI, I have also included information re PG&E.   If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation.  

We have not really tried to "tie" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills.  Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors.  EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so.   

Let me know what you think, or if you need anything else.  If you follow Rick's suggestion, it might be a short meeting anyway. 

Wanda

FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.

CLECA, CIU and the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group have also come out wi=
th all guns blazing against the draft decision dealing with the DWR revenue=
 requirement.  They decry the lack of hearings, state that there are fundam=
ental untruths in the decision and conclude that, "The DWR has made it clea=
r that it needs to have a decision on its revenue requirements quickly so t=
hat it can successfully issue bonds to generate revenue to re-pay the gener=
al fund.  No one has been permitted to test that proposition, but it seems =
to be accepted as fact by decision makers.  The problem is that this record=
 does not support approval of any particular revenue requirement for DWR an=
d it certainly does not support the allocation proposed in the DD.  If the =
Commission must act quickly, then it must act provisionally and set for fur=
ther hearings the many questions identified here and, we suspect, in the co=
mments of many other interested parties concerning the basis of the allocat=
ion among the utilities."

I'm not positive.  The best way to find out is to call the Public Advisor at the PUC directly.  He'll be happy to fill you in on how to get on the list of speakers.  And I'm sure it's very easy to do.  I'll definitely give you a heads up regarding the Wednesday calls, though they've really wound down alot since the Legislature took off for vacation.  Hope all is well.
 
Best to you and yours,
Jeff

Subject: CPUC question


Jeff --
 
First of all, I wanted to thank you for your positive comments to Karen about my work on behalf of Enron.  She asked me to stay on board on an hourly, as-needed basis while they try to figure out what will happen next year.  Although I don't expect much work, it's certainly better than being cut out completely and she mentioned that you had appreciated my help during the contempt negotiations.  
 
I don't envy Karen for her job at the moment.  I've been getting the clips and Houston doesn't look like a fun place to be right now.  I also don't think they're planning too far in advance.  Yikes!
 
I've got a couple of CPUC questions for you.  What's the process for making a presentation in regard to either a specific case on the agenda?  Is it simply a matter of being present during a public hearing, or is there a list of witnesses/commentors that you have to get on?  The reason I ask is that I've been approached by a potential client regarding some telecommunications/broadband issues, with an appearance at the CPUC as a news hook.
 
How far in advance is the meeting agenda set?  I noticed that a meeting is scheduled for Nov. 29, but an agenda was not available on the Web site.  Is it likely that it is still being compiled?  How do you get on the agenda?
 
Any light you can shed on this for me would be appreciated.  I don't know if this project is going to come through or not, but I'm not sure my possible client is any better versed on CPUC procedures than I am.  I figure at least one of us should know what we're talking about.
 
Thanks!  You might give me a heads up if there's anything on one of the upcoming Wednesday calls that you'd like me to comment on.  Since I'm basically on call, I probably won't dial in unless someone gives me a reason.
 
Best,
Ken

I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher, but Burton relies on him alot.  He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA.

I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.  Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them.
I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.
I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.

He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.

There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req.  The reason:  no urgency anymore.  Let's take a little time and get it right.

Best,
Jeff

Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.

As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.

These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  

I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.

Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.

Talk to you at noon your time.

Best,
Jeff

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

You should contact Tim directly.  There is a tariff section on each website and a search function using key words.  The utilities issue reports on OFO incidents, and Tim should have those as well.  Let me know if there's anything we can do.

Jeff-
Should I contact Tim Hamilton, or have you already done this?  Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is, that would be helpful.  Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?  We need all of that to better evaluate our risks/costs of serving those customers.  Thanks for your help.

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester.  Just wanted to say congratulations.  I'm finished with this semester after today, but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish.  Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front.  Happy Holidays to all.  

And if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy, please feel free to get in touch.

Subject: where does our energy come from?


Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the
following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in
light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of
our present Governor.

Regards,
Curt

---------------------------------------------


***Who Really Powers California?***
Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,
cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy
crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the
Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers
may
be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The
following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each
group of
generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded
up
resulting in slightly more than 100%)

18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)
15%- Southern California Edison (California)
11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)
10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)
10%- Imported power from the Southwest
7%- State and Federal Agencies
6%- AES power company
5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts
5%- Reliant power company
4%- Duke power company
4%- Southern power company
4%- Dynegy power company
1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)
1%- Calpine power company
1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)
 
It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from
Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's
energy
portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's
AES,
and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy
portfolio.

This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every
provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to
identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high
profits
on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our
investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power
companies,
utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts
could
all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those
companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a
misrepresentation of fact.

invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a
1998
forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year
forecast.
TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this
amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the
end
of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the
Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted
amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The
rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the
electric
distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject
to
refund.

2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric
distribution
capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.

3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was
reduced by $9.2 million.

4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to
justify
the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated
that
PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed
amount
by $7.9 million.

5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had
failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA
customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that
money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had
disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission
disallowed $20 million.

6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2
million as
funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which
they
had not received any benefits.

There will not be a call this week.
Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.

I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and got an update of discussions with PG&E.  He received an email yesterday from Dan Richards (Steve Kean equivalent at PG&E) and he is getting a contact for us to interface with at PG&E on this issue.  Dan indicated that he would try and have a name and number to Jeff by early next week, so Jeff will keep us posted.  If you have any questions, comments, etc. give me a call and I'll track it down.

I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.  We can hold off on that.  In addition, I may have some "salvaged" redwood decking I may want to add to the mix once I get ready to install the decking.

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

Dan:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.

The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.
The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.
For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.
By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.
In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.
We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.
Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.

Thanks for listening. Let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Conversation w/Jerry Hirsch of LA Times

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Subject:	How to get your Outlook mail remotely
Importance:	High

Hey Everybody!

Now that I have had a chance to test remote mail myself I think I can give you the basics and hopefully field your questions.

You can access your Outlook mail from any computer connected to the internet without logging on to any Enron dial-ups or sites.  
       To repeat: You can get to your Outlook mail without connecting to Enron.

On any internet connected computer type mail.enron.com in the address box.

At this point a logon box will appear.  It says, 'Please type your user name and password.'.  This is the exact user name and password 
       you use to logon to your Enron computer.

A Microsoft Outlook Web Access page should open up.  Mine opens directly to my Inbox, yours should too.  If not, one of the shortcuts in 
       the vertical 'tool bar', on the left side of the screen shout be an Inbox icon.  Click on it.      

To see your folders you will need to click on the word 'Folders' on the left side, vertical 'tool bar'.

Please try this at work so I can help answer your questions and concerns before you are out and about trying this new system.

Note: When accessing email through the internet you will not have a spell check option.  Your best bet is to copy/paste the email 
                 to a word or excel sheet and spell check it there.  Then make the necessary adjustments in your email before sending.

Please contact me with any questions you have, or if you need help logging on.

April

Despite the personal pleasure that I would derive from seeing Glynn and Richard strike out big time, it's not worth the price to ratepayers of letting these pirates (yes, pirates!) rip off so many valuable assets that should stay under PUC regulation for the benefit of consumers.

I thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it, but I may have it all wrong.  In any case, please see attached regarding utilities joint proposal on implementing the DA suspension.  Community Aggregation would not be allowed after Sept 20th.  Is anything you care about and/or have a position on?  Thanks very much. Hope you're well.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff

Hello Jeff,

We're winding down a large project , about two more weeks, and preping
to begin another, but we should have a small window of opportunity to
get to your project, if you're still interested in having us do the
work.

So we need to meet or I need more info from you to get a good idea of
exactly what you want.

Please let me know.

Thank you!

The call was pretty tough. 
Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Best,
Jeff

Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me know when you're going to be here.  Love to have dinner and catch up.

You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great if you got involved.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Greetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that Karl Wood and Bob Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  Dorothy, talked to Keith yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

Hello lawyers,

Attached is a draft of an appeal to the Sup Ct. of the CPUC's decision
to suspend DA.  The authors would like review and comment and to
consider joining the petition. Comments back to Jeff Dasovich asap, they
want to file by Nov 9.

Greetings.  Well, it's about over for the company known as Enron.  Ultimately I, and just about everyone else, am going to need to find a new job.  But it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive.  It's a shame that such a fun, interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised (at a minimum) extremely poor judgment.  But it is what it is.  As for me, I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around. I've already had a few calls from "inquiring minds," so we'll we where things end up.  Thanks so much for the thoughts. Definitely crazy times, but I'm not getting to worked up about it.  And besides, Prentice has accepted PWC's offer, so I'm looking forward to housekeeping!

Best,
Jeff

You may recall that the last summary included SCE advice letter 1586-E.  This was the advice filing that seeksto implement a number of the regulatory components included in the October 2, 2001 Settlement Agreement between the CPUC and SCE.  The summary noted that Edison asked for comments to be due on November 28.  That request has been denied (see the attached letter), and comments are instead due on December 4.

[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need." 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

Well, I guess my good friend Jerry's a little to busy these days.  I'm going to contact another lawyer who represents some big QFs and then loop back with Jerry.

Best,
Jeff

Jerry,

First off I would like to again commend you on your presentation yesterday.  It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.

As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.  The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.  As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.  I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.  I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.  Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.

Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Mike

Under Angelides flawed reasoning, shouldn't energy efficiency be outlawed, since every kilowatt saved means less money to pay DWR for the contracts and the bonds to fill the hole in the state budget?  Why pick on DA?

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis.
By Amy Chance
Bee Political Editor
(Published Sept. 26, 2001) 
Gov. Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. 
The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. 
Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo. 
"It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said. "It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis." 
In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. 
The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. 
Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading." 
"These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said. "These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general." 
DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. 
In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. 
Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent. 
"Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said. "He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. 
"No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative." 
DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. 
Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis. 
"It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way." 
South said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. 
"We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942."

California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds. 
The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November. 
The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . 
Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. 
Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. 
Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. 
From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. 
He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. 
In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually. 
Calls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE=09September 20, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout," said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  "And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders." =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=
0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=
ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20

?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=
iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=
shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=
tility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=
 lines and cables.
The new gas transmission business will be a California company established =
to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=
y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=
s storage facilities. =20
Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=
ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=
ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =
for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=
e provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=
risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =
Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=
s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20
Glynn said, "This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=
able and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=
 company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =
generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=
 to pay creditors."
The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=
f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=
 and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=
ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=
nization.=20
"We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=
 do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs," said =
Glynn.  "We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=
he people who know how to run them best."
In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=
stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=
te.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=
 for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=
bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=
esources.
The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =
be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20
Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=
rs, said "This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=
esolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=
ull support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=
r 11 process."=20
"With this plan filed," said Glynn, "we are now focused on bringing the Cha=
pter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw=
orthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=

This release contains forward looking statements about the proposed plan of=
 reorganization (Plan) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code for Pacific =
Gas and Electric Company (Utility). These statements are necessarily subjec=
t to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to dif=
fer materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements.  =
Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all of th=
e factors that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed, or whether, i=
f confirmed, it will become effective, some of the factors that could affec=
t the outcome materially include: the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi=
ngs; the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified; legislative and r=
egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect=
ric and natural gas industries in the United States, particularly in Califo=
rnia; whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or =
whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all; risks re=
lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated =
entities, including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial=
 projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe=
d claims, and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due =
to, among other reasons, an adverse change in market conditions or in the c=
ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings; =
whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to pre-empt relevant n=
on-bankruptcy law and if so, whether and the extent to which such assertion=
 of jurisdiction is successfully challenged; whether a favorable tax ruling=
 or opinion is obtained regarding the tax-free nature of the internal restr=
ucturings and  spin off contemplated by the Plan; and the ability of the Ut=
ility to successfully disaggregate its businesses;=20

Diann and Mike,

Attached is a notice we propose sending to our customers that were overcharged UUT as a result of PG&E's billing practices.  Because of the UUT refund statute of limitations,  the sooner the notices are sent the fewer refund dollars our customers will lose.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the notice further or if it is acceptable for sending with the spreadsheets that Diann's group is putting together showing the amount of the potentially overpaid UUT.  

Thanks,

Jeff

Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis
By Michael B. Marois 
Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. 
The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. 
Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. 
The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. 
The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.

In a speech last night at Standford's Hoover Institution, Abraham announced the money to Upgrade Path 15 and said it should be completed by '03.  Said a consortium of IOUs (including PG&E), munis and generators will participate.


Press is also reporting this morning that Davis administration is confirming that it's trying to rework some of the long-term DWR contracts.

The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

Best,
Jeff

No deal in energy refund talks=20
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- Negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of Cali=
fornia's electricity debacle sputtered to an end Monday with the sides ligh=
t-years apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales.=20
The impasse raises the specter of years of litigation, with a regulatory ju=
dge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about $1 billion while =
California is seeking at least $8.9 billion and perhaps much more.=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Curtis Wagner sai=
d that within a week he'll urge the five FERC commissioners to begin fact-f=
inding hearings on how much is truly owed, following guidelines he outlined=
 sketchily Monday.=20
Among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed -- something=
 that could reduce state claims by about one-third -- and changing the way =
power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators.=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis said he was heartened by the judge's belief that California=
 is due some amount of refund money, rejecting the generators' arguments fo=
r no refunds.=20
With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power t=
raders had offered up $716 million in proposed refunds in the final days. B=
ut Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state st=
ill owes power companies, meaning no cash would actually change hands.=20
The judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San=
 Jose-based Calpine Corp., could reach separate agreements with the state.=
=20
"From what I know, it looks like we can reach an agreement," Calpine spokes=
man Bill Highlander confirmed Monday. But he said he could not disclose any=
 details under Wagner's gag order on participants in the negotiations.=20
Enron Corp., one of the nation's highest-profile power traders, said Califo=
rnia officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the=
 state's consumers deserved at least $8.9 billion in refunds for overcharge=
s.=20
"These talks never had a chance," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. "Their =
political skins are worth more than $716 million that the taxpayers of Cali=
fornia could have used. It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a =
witch hunt."=20
Of the $716 million compromise offer, $510 million was put on the table by =
what Wagner called the "Big Five" generators -- Reliant, Duke, Mirant, Will=
iams and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation. Another $125=
 million was offered by BC Hydro, British Colombia's government utility, wh=
ich is not under FERC jurisdiction, and $16.5 million was offered by six Ca=
lifornia municipal utilities.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the state's second-largest munic=
ipal utility, also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amoun=
t it may have offered, but said it would outline its position in writing Th=
ursday, the judge's deadline for comments on his proposal.=20
Consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge's brief publi=
c remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on=
 the state's troubled electric scene.=20
"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's outra=
geous," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. "If they're g=
oing to start doing some fact finding, hallelujah."=20
Hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start, because there was =
no effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been a=
nd then work toward a compromise from there.=20
The state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator, the Ind=
ependent System Operator, which was attacked by marketers as wildly high ev=
en while the state called it conservatively low.=20
Joel Newton, representing all five of the big generators, said Monday that =
the ISO has consistently based its demand on "sketchy and incomplete" data.=
=20
The face-off between Davis and power merchants began last fall, as wholesal=
e electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they =
could be driven into bankruptcy.=20
The governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state's powe=
r shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers. Generators said they =
followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situati=
on.=20
FERC, which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electr=
icity rates are "just and reasonable," has made repeated, unsuccessful effo=
rts to craft a solution that could appease both sides.=20
State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said Monday that t=
he failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure "comes as no=
 surprise."=20
Negotiators representing generators "refused to even acknowledge the inesca=
pable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional=
 market -- at California's expense," he said.=20
Davis, who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith=
 with state representatives, said that although FERC commissioners have bee=
n slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesa=
le electricity, they "now have the opportunity to redeem themselves."=20
He suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is rec=
ommended by the judge.=20
Wagner, after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend, seemed=
 resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government, utility=
 and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futilit=
y.=20
Michael Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the Calif=
ornia ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well.=
=20
"We came here wanting $8.9 billion," Kahn said. "In all candor, we didn't r=
eceive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as=
 helpful as we had hoped they would be. But our positions were vindicated" =
because refunds were offered.=20
Meanwhile, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison soun=
ded the call for more talks.=20
"We're willing to talk to anyone, anytime about a settlement," said Steve P=
ickett, general counsel of Southern California Edison. PG&E said in a prepa=
red statement that the sessions "provide a solid basis for further negotiat=
ions."=20
How much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question =
mark. Wagner said settlement offers of $716 million suggest that eventual r=
efunds will amount to "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion." B=
ut he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC comm=
issioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be.=20
Other recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mi=
xed bag for the state.=20
The judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct. 2, 2000=
, an action that Kahn said would immediately slice $3 billion off the state=
's refund analysis that stretched back to May 2000.=20
But Kahn said that was no defeat for the state, which would turn to the cou=
rts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order.=
=20
"We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder," Kahn said.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy of North Am=
erica, said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund =
order in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20
"It's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks," Bailey=
 said.=20

Third power plant opens: But the Los Medanos facility isn't pouring out ele=
ctricity yet.=20
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
The flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov. Gray Davis was only a t=
rickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on Monday, accord=
ing to sources close to California's energy crisis.=20
Heralded by Davis as part of a "powerful one-two-three punch" that will bri=
ng California closer to energy independence, the Los Medanos Energy Center =
in Pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day, they sa=
id.=20
That is less than 5 percent of the plant's 555-megawatt operating capacity.=
=20
Los Medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week bu=
t is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks, accordin=
g to knowledgable sources.=20
Representatives for Calpine and the governor's office, when pressed for det=
ails, acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said the=
y did not know how much electricity was actually produced Monday.=20
Calpine, which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from Los=
 Medanos, is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn't immediat=
ely available for the media, spokeswoman Katherine Potter said.=20
"Even if it was two megawatts, that's two more megawatts that we didn't hav=
e yesterday," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
He said the opening was "largely ceremonial," timed for the convenience of =
the governor and Calpine's top executive.=20
But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the media event "a deception=
." It was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has a=
ttended in the past two weeks.=20
"It's the governor trying to convince people he's hard at work solving the =
problem when it's all for show," Rosenfield said. "He's governing by sound =
bite. He's certainly getting his money's worth from the consultants he hire=
d."=20
Davis political adviser Garry South said last week that the governor's new =
radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in Calif=
ornia.=20
"Generation comes up in our polls as being the No. 1 thing people want us t=
o do -- build more power plants," South said then. "People want the sense t=
hat progress is being made -- that this is not spiraling out of control."=
=20
The other two plants that Davis kicked off -- Sunrise in Kern County and Su=
tter near Yuba City -- have since been running at maximum capacity.=20
Calpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of Los Medanos withi=
n a week to 10 days, company officials said.=20
"In the first month of these new plants, there are always stops and starts,=
" said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander. "Sometimes we shut down altogethe=
r."=20
Including the three just-opened facilities, new or expanded power plants ar=
e expected to add 1,500 megawatts to the state's struggling electric grid b=
y the end of July, and 870 megawatts of that is already in place, according=
 to the state Independent System Operator.=20
Another 1,000 megawatts is anticipated for the end of August and 1,100 more=
 for the end of September, under a rough timetable that is likely to see so=
me plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind.=20

State reveals high-priced power deals=20
By Dale Kasler and Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
The state Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity o=
n the spot market, revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wild=
ly within minutes.=20
The Department of Water Resources, which has been criticized for keeping it=
s power-purchasing practices a secret, released 1,770 pages of invoices and=
 trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purcha=
ses since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan. 17. The informatio=
n was released a week after state Controller Kathleen Connell put out detai=
ls of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gra=
y Davis, her political nemesis.=20
The state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of Cal=
ifornia's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising ques=
tions from lawmakers and others about Davis' policies for resolving the sta=
te's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of=
 gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.=20
When it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a=
 business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days =
in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot=
 cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largel=
y because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their depe=
ndence on spot sales.=20
"Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum," sai=
d Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.=20
The information released Monday covered the first three months of the year =
and didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for elec=
tricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas gene=
rator that owns several plants in the state. Duke Energy Corp. of North Car=
olina charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but t=
hat sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state'=
s transmission grid.=20
The documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy =
power for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.=20
Through May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent o=
f San Diego Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energ=
y Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a=
bout $23.7 million.=20
Among others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 m=
illion through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; At=
lanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville =
Power Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility Dis=
trict $80.7 million.=20
Generally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the price=
s. For instance, Oklahoma-based generator Williams Cos. commanded $565 a me=
gawatt-hour March 20, when blackouts struck more than 1 million Californian=
s.=20
Location also was critical. On March 8 the state paid the PG&E trading unit=
 $250 but only $180 to Arizona-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The differ=
ence was that PG&E's power was delivered to energy-starved Northern Califor=
nia, while Pinnacle's was sent to Southern California where energy wasn't s=
o scarce.=20
Split-second timing was also crucial. At 9:09 a.m. Feb. 14, the state paid =
$400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day. By 10 a.m. it was pa=
ying Mieco Inc., a Long Beach trading firm, $475 for the same product.=20
"That's the spot market -- it's the most volatile market in the world, and =
it changes on a second-by-second basis," said Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Pa=
lmer.=20
For all the criticism leveled at Duke, Reliant and other big corporations, =
government-owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high p=
rices.=20
BC Hydro, the electric utility owned by the Canadian province of British Co=
lumbia, submitted bills for up to $1,000 a megawatt-hour. The city of Glend=
ale charged $375 a megawatt-hour for power in January, while SMUD charged $=
309 a megawatt-hour in March. The city of Eugene, Ore., averaged $450 a meg=
awatt-hour in February.=20
"We play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace," said BC Hydro =
spokesman Wayne Cousins. "Our traders worked very hard to find additional s=
ources of electricity to keep the lights on in California. Had we not come =
through and stepped forward with these supplies, the consequences to Califo=
rnia customers would have been severe."=20
The state also said it has spent $14.4 million on administrative costs in b=
uying power.=20

Government finds ways to conserve: The Santa Rita Jail goes solar as agenci=
es get creative to cut costs.
By Cheryl Miller
Bee Correspondent
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
To Matt Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa Rita =
Jail in Dublin aren't just energy-makers; they're money in the bank.=20
When all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt=
 photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the=
 United States -- will cut the jail's demand on the electric grid by up to =
20 percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.=20
That sun power, combined with conservation projects already completed at th=
e jail, will slash about $300,000 a year from the facility's energy bill. M=
uniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.=20
"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a bu=
siness decision, just investing your money," said Muniz. "There's virtually=
 no maintenance on this equipment. It just sits on your roof and converts r=
ight into electricity that you're using as soon as you generate it. I think=
 (solar) is the wave of the future, even though it's been around 30 or 40 y=
ears."=20
The Santa Rita Jail project is among the largest, and perhaps most conspicu=
ous, examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity us=
e in response to skyrocketing power bills and Gov. Gray Davis' call for pub=
lic entities to conserve.=20
Among the examples:=20
San Francisco leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar-powered=
 rooftop projects around the city.=20
The Tulare County town of Lindsay will open City Hall two hours earlier -- =
at 6 a.m.-- and close at 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday this summer so o=
ffices can stay dark all day Friday and during peak-use afternoon hours.=20
Sacramento County has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can bet=
ter withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees. Workers=
 have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps oper=
ate during low demand.=20
"When you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns fr=
om some citizens, that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help ou=
t," said Jolena Voorhis, an energy analyst at the California State Associat=
ion of Counties. "Certainly (counties) stepped up to the plate when they we=
re asked to increase conservation efforts. They've done about as much as hu=
manly possible."=20
Kings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signe=
d up for Southern California Edison's interruptible load program, which pro=
mises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrica=
l services in times of shortage.=20
Then California's power crisis hit full-force this year. Since January, Edi=
son has called on the Central Valley county to cut electricity at its Hanfo=
rd government center 16 times -- for up to six hours each cycle.=20
At times that meant no lights to greet the public, no computers to process =
food stamp requests and during the Valley's foggy winter days, no heat to w=
arm many of the 1,200 employees.=20
"We had one week in January when we were virtually shut down," said Chief A=
dministrative Officer Larry Spikes. "We just decided we couldn't function t=
hat way."=20
So Kings County supervisors bought a $550,000 diesel-powered generator to m=
atch those already at the jail and juvenile center. They also decided to op=
en and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildin=
gs can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 p.m.=20
The new hours, dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the =
generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business =
these days, Spikes said.=20
So far, most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without =
cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years=
, Voorhis said.=20
Public agencies' power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses.=20
Revenues at PowerLight, the Berkeley company that installed the Santa Rita =
Jail photovoltaic system, have tripled since last year.=20
"The last six months have been particularly intense," said Janice Lin, dire=
ctor of business development for PowerLight. "In some ways the energy crisi=
s in California has been a call to action."=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which already boasts the largest=
 photovoltaic program in the country, has a 2,000-customer waiting list for=
 solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state Capitol, said Don=
 Osborn, SMUD's solar program manager.=20
Back in Dublin, the 3,600 inmates at the Santa Rita Jail still receive thre=
e meals, air conditioning and hot showers -- powered now, in part, by the p=
lentiful sun in this relatively fog-free part of the East Bay.=20
The $4 million project, financed entirely with state and utility subsidies,=
 should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade, Muniz =
said.=20
"It's a good investment for the money we're putting up front," he said.






   Energy talks reach no settlement; state threatens suit        By Mark Sh=
erman ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the =
state and power generators stalled, California may go to court to help win =
the $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity=
.  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the j=
udge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less,"=
 said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.  With negotiations at=
 an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory=
 Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in ref=
unds.    "The numbers were too far apart," said Curtis Wagner, the FERC chi=
ef administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing =
at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for an=
y overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 millio=
n and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an ov=
erall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wag=
ner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 bill=
ion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may=
 ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges f=
rom the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those all=
egations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner serv=
ed as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a se=
ttlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last mont=
h in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over =
the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer adv=
ocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue =
its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power compan=
ies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give bac=
k all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said =
Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpaye=
r and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased w=
ith Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, said=
 even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "t=
hat's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  Calif=
ornia officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities C=
ommission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating sup=
ply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices ar=
e high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power=
 plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power=
 in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year bef=
ore. Davis has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this =
year.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossl=
y inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - Duke Energy, Dynegy, =
Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. - said in a statement that the=
y have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  Reliant would ag=
ree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement=
 that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, s=
aid John H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, "=
Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are jus=
tified."              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees p=
ossibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert =
 COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between=
 California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collap=
sed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal reg=
ulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 bill=
ion in refunds.  "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of =
dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administr=
ative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previ=
ewing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who =
mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f=
or electricity "that probably are higher than any overcharges" for which th=
ey may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California co=
uld see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po=
wer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util=
ities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing=
" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising=
 from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai=
d FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula incl=
udes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for ca=
lculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintai=
n that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  "I would suspect that =
would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," said Joe Ronan, vice pre=
sident of Calpine, a San Jose-based electricity generator. "I think (Wagner=
's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened" in the state's =
dysfunctional power market.  But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator,=
 said Wagner "vindicated" California's core arguments.  "The hundreds of pe=
ople who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there =
should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected," said Kah=
n, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power gri=
d.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be =
in the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, =
we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the r=
emainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its=
 $8.9 billion."  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation r=
emains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their con=
duct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position. =
 During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhe=
re near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers h=
ad put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  "That's a long way from=
 splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, you can't work miracles."=
  Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will betwee=
n the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the pr=
eviously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of barga=
ining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  John H.=
 Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the=
 state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund dema=
nd. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 mil=
lion it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot b=
ack that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approach=
ed the state.  Figures scrutinized "This is the first time we've heard any =
of this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been c=
ooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading," Kahn said.  The stat=
e's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The =
$8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera=
tor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when=
 wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli=
cated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b=
een if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo=
r the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to =
tame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner =
said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis fo=
r calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he s=
aid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, an=
d should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula=
ted.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas=
 heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr=
ices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rath=
er than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Tho=
se and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre=
ase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over=
charges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to Octobe=
r would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  Brent=
 Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North America, =
said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast improvement o=
ver FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's) model."  Ame=
rica.  In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the=
 electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith.  =
"While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers=
, they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 =
billion California has demonstrated it is owed," Davis said.  Despite the h=
arsh rhetoric, both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reac=
h one-on-one settlements.  Ronan of Calpine said the generator was close to=
 making a deal with the state. Bailey said that while Duke would continue t=
o push for a "global settlement" between all the parties, "We've had seriou=
s settlement talks with the state over the last few days and hope to contin=
ue."               State's massive outlays detailed        Energy bill exce=

 2001  SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spendin=
g topped $100 million, according to a report released yesterday by state po=
wer traders.  The California Department of Water Resources report, which ad=
dressed spot market electricity purchases since January, was released along=
 with 1,770 pages of documents that specifically detailed the first three m=
onths of last-minute power purchases.  Such power buys on the spot market t=
ypically get the most expensive electricity available.  The report details =
the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov=
er electricity purchases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., San Diego Gas & =
Electric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bi=
llions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. S=
ince then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  Th=
e state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highes=
t daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million. The day befo=
re, the state spent $100 million.  But since May, spot market prices have d=
ropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, increase=
d conservation which lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by la=
wmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis=
 has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  "It does look lik=
e some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it looks like it's pri=
marily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for Assembl=
y Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot market prices "underscores que=
stions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natura=
l gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term contrac=
ts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  "It's unfortunate that=
 it looks like we'll never get out from under these contracts," Fisfis said=
.  Davis has already released details of the state's long-term power contra=
cts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several new=
s organizations, including The Associated Press and The Copley Press, which=
 publishes The San Diego Union-Tribune.  Davis released copies of those con=
tracts, but wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short-t=
erm contracts. Releasing those details too soon after the purchases would r=
eveal the state's buying strategy and could cause generators to raise their=
 already sky-high prices, Davis said.  The number of spot market buys will =
lessen, the Davis administration says, as more long-term contracts are sign=
ed, reducing the state's exposure to the high-priced purchases.  The govern=
or's office will release future short-term contracts and spot market buys w=
ill be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag time. Second quarte=
r information will be released in October and third quarter documents will =
be available in January.  Davis maintains the delay is needed to protect it=
s ability to negotiate further spot-market power buys.  According to the wa=
ter department, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has been p=
aid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.  But Atlanta-base=
d Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as of the end of May=
.  The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state had to =
pay when it needed power the most.  On March 19 and 20, when rolling blacko=
uts hit California again, the state was forced into paying above-average pr=
ices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold the sta=
te 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345 a meg=
awatt hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96.  The day befo=
re, Mirant charged $343 a megawatt hour at off-peak in northern California =
when the average cost was $254.52.  Also on March 19, Mirant charged the st=
ate about $96 above the average price for power in Northern California on a=
 sale of 6,400 megawatt hours during off-peak times.  Other top-selling gen=
erators, as of May 31:   Sempra Cos., $429 million.   Los Angeles Departmen=

 Billion From Associated Press  July 9 2001  WASHINGTON -- California is ow=
ed no more than "a billion dollars" from power wholesalers, a federal regul=
atory judge said today at the end of 15 days of settlement talks in the sta=
te's electricity crisis.  Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=
ission's chief administrative law judge, said that at the same time the pow=
er suppliers probably are owed more than that.  The net effect of his preli=
minary recommendation is that California probably will receive no refunds f=
rom wholesalers.  Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in =
refunds. The state has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said h=
e will not recommend refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.  =
It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary recommenda=
tion would have on efforts to settle the dispute.  Both sides said before t=
he judge's announcement that they expected a protracted legal battle in the=
 event the talks did not produce a settlement.  Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Dav=
is's representative in the talks, has said the state would seek more than t=
wice the claimed overcharges if the dispute moved from mediated talks to a =
courtroom.  The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are gr=
ossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dyne=
gy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that=
 they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  John H. Stou=
t, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company would agree=
 to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall settlement t=
hat also would have to include protection from additional legal claims.  Bu=
t Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains tha=
t no refunds are justified."  FERC ordered the talks last month in an effor=
t to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown=
 of California's deregulated electricity market.  The state has accused the=
 producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices. The producer=
s have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of n=
atural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free mar=
ket.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last=
 year from $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state c=
ould spend as much as $50 billion this year.  ----  On the Net:  Federal En=

CH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 =
2001  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more divers=
e group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davi=
s, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records =
show.  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretch=
es of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and privat=
e entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid=
 to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by =
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.  Am=
ong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per meg=
awatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & =
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=
r, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour =
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292=
 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies s=
ingled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., D=
uke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid =
for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=
r megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.  The figures co=
ver the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state =
during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month o=
f razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies.  Davis spok=
esman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at p=
rivate out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the hi=
ghest profits over the longest period.  "You have to look at the whole pict=
ure," Maviglio said.  "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the=
 arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits=
 were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other enti=
ties who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact t=
hat we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or =
Charlotte."  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided t=
o The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on =
California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year=
's first quarter.  The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion=
 buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the comp=
lexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high =
prices are not limited to a few generators.  Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for=
 the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that price=
s were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he=
 said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying pow=
er in mid-January.  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purch=
ases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an ave=
rage of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of t=
he year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest pri=
vate companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's bigge=
st power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta=
-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, c=
harged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.  By contrast, a Calgary, Canad=
a, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacrament=
o Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.=
  A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification =
of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could no=
t be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the =
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=
 last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.  =
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, s=
aid late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see=
 the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reac=
hed Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of produc=
ing the power needed by the state were extremely high.  More Power Bought T=
han Projected  Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agen=
cy's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falli=
ng natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market.  Still, the s=
tate had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more=
 than Davis' analysts had projected.  Hidlago said that was because of hot =
weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will sho=
w that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early Ju=
ly.  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in =
June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to wel=
l under $100 a megawatt-hour.  A summary Department of Water Resources repo=
rt released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generatio=
n and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the Californ=
ia electric energy industry closer to normalcy."  Copyright 2001, Los Angel=
es Times       Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator sa=
ys the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the=
 price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRI=
TER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing=
 suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday=
 that Duke Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key t=
o his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the pr=
ice bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee m=
embers and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data can=
not be made public without Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula=
 Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to=
 drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records=
 show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyratio=
ns to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal=
 thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedi=
al legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with o=
thers in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority =
to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  "The only o=
ne who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what is provi=
ded in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.  Former Employees T=
ell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to ob=
tain the information elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."  Th=
ree former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month =
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=
at seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergen=
cy.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=
 California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricit=
y grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its exp=
lanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to pro=
vide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Du=
nn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said =
Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, Du=
ke was guilty of the same tactics.  "Duke is trying to draw the impression =
that it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we c=
annot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. Tha=
t hasn't occurred," Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula V=
ista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must p=
ublicly examine "the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders t=
o the plant." They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, =
he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several pla=
nts in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and =
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom William=
s insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's =
demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidd=
ing documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn o=
ver.  "We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that=
 we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I=
 don't know what we are ultimately going to do."  The committee had threate=
ned to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidd=
ing documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have said they would compl=
y to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn sa=
id the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to=
 comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charge=
d with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the fina=
l arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying pe=
nalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing seve=
re fines. In 1929, the most recent case, a cement company executive was sen=
t to jail.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        NEWS ANALYSIS Concern =
Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows Embedded costs may yield more rat=
e hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion total could complicate plans to r=
escue Edison. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve=
n as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray Davis prepares =
for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power=
 plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting =
task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-la=
sting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for =
consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by =
the governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-=
control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A gr=
owing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat=
ing one of Davis' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial r=
escue of Southern California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate =
in the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readie=
s a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund f=
or other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac=
ts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead =
to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer=
 advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact=
s be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these=
 critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts=
 and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the d=
eals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the st=
ate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f=
or more than 25 million residents.  "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Co=
mmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state s=
truck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  B=
owen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals the=
y could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati=
ons took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."  Contr=
acts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, mor=
e immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto=
n. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework=
ed as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar=
ged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  "We ought not to say, 'Fine=
, the contracts were the best we could do,' " Bowen said.  For his part, Da=
vis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the=
 form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes th=
e recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the ad=
ministration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon=
g-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily,=
 or spot, market.  "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . =
. dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Califo=
rnians," Davis said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30=
% from May to June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped nego=
tiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, gi=
ven the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for Califor=
nia's electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to some=
one who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. "After the fire is out,=
" he said, "you complain about the water damage."  The contracts have other=
 defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, =
who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene=
rators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure t=
o wild swings in price.  "The point of signing long-term contracts is not t=
o get a great price; it's to reduce risk," Borenstein said.  Still, experts=
 have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S=
an Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz=
ations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Davis unseal the c=
ontracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep=
resenting Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consume=
r group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-bill=
ion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c=
osts. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip=
ment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an =
additional 10% to 20%.  "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Repub=
lican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who ca=
n read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated."  As buyers' r=
emorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as =
a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa=
ching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing =
into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc=
y for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b=
y Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is schedu=
led to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along wi=
th legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which=
 has little apparent support, would require the state to buy Edison's syste=
m of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge =
ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists a=
nd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th=
e California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la=
rgest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the =
new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an=
d repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest muni=
cipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t=
he Edison rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may n=
eed to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contr=
acts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he=
 concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses =
political lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers =
Union, and Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Tech=
nology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in s=
eparate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  "If there is a way to buy=
 our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be be=
tter off in the long run," Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leade=
rs, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with=
 the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  "They are proble=
matic," he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit=
y prices for the next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t=
o agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by=
 the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State=
 Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.=
4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i=
nvestors can be assured that they will be repaid.  "The state will be out o=
f cash by the end of the year without the bond sale," he said. "We will mov=
e toward fiscal insolvency."  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of whic=
h was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulate=
d utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 b=
illion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to p=
ay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t=
he Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated=
 to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm=
all customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not appr=
oved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department=
 of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this=
 year and next.  "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D=
-San Francisco) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would requir=
e the commission to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water =
Resources decides to do."  "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat=
ic office," he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  Stewart of the manufactu=
rers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water a=
gency with "dictatorial power."  "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process=
, at least there is a process," Stewart said, referring to the commission's=
 procedures to set electricity rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR jus=
t tells the PUC, 'This is what we need,' and the PUC must approve it."  Oth=
ers say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordi=
nary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department=
 of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in=
to debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers. =
 In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January create=
d "the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdict=
ion of the PUC.  "There is no public power agency in California that is rev=
iewed by the PUC," said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department =
of Water and Power.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angel=

cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/07/10/MN117914.DTL   Washington -- An adm=
inistrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to Gov. Gray Davis and=
 California energy officials, cast aside the state's claim that it is owed =
$8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for furthe=
r hearings to determine "hard numbers."  The judge, ending talks designed t=
o settle the dispute between California and power sellers, said the state a=
nd its cash-strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills tha=
n they are owed for overcharges by the generators.  The comments by Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis L. Wagn=
er, although a strong endorsement of the generators' position, seemed to in=
dicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the f=
ive-member regulatory commission.  "There are refunds due (to California) t=
hat total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wag=
ner said yesterday.  "At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from =
the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities=
 in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t=
hat (the state) may come up with."  Now, it will be up to the federal regul=
ators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated t=
he talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th=
e state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=
  The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t=
o calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearing=
s would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 =
days, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing=
 session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulato=
ry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca=
lifornia officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a=
 sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D=
avis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for=
 California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the=
 close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s=
tate is owed refunds.  "I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo=
logy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no =
refunds are due," Davis said.  The governor's chief representative at the t=
alks, Michael Kahn, called the judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of=
 the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve th=
e state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATOR=
S FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  Fo=
r example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9=
 billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t=
he regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 200=
0 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t=
he October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at =
least $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  Brent Bailey,=
 vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America, said that=
 under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.=
5 billion.  "Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California =
has been saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.  Bu=
t Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a =
serious offer.  "Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer=
s out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f=
aith," Davis said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the=
 generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The =
judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Fi=
ve generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 milli=
on by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California =
municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel=
lers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in=
cluded no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of=
 the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complain=
ed that the California team was trying to shield some California companies =
and government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying t=
o disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVOR=
ITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to=
 remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego=
 Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g=
overnment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun=
ds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el=
se.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad=
e a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom=
ise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputa=
tion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.  "The Califo=
rnia delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compr=
omise," said Mark Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supply Assoc=
iation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. "They went in with a dollar figure=
 and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement, you h=
ave to be willing to compromise."  Up next 1. The Federal Energy Regulatory=
 Commission will consider, probably on July 25,  new hearings on how much, =
if anything, California was overcharged. 2. If ordered by the commission, a=
n administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says i=
t was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed. 3. Regulators =
will rule based on the judge's recommendation. If the parties disagree, the=
y can go to court.  E-mail the writers at zcoile@sfchronicle.com . and cber=

m/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/07/10/MN175828.DTL      Pittsburg -- Wo=
rkers were still scraping wet concrete on support columns as Gov. Gray Davi=
s celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the=
 latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help California "build its=
 way" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to throw as many megawatts=
 on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular b=
lackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was paying off.  "This is the =
third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," Davis said, pumping his =
fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of steam. "In t=
he past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than California did throu=
ghout the 1990s."  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutte=
r Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of=
 1,115 megawatts online. Last month, Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfiel=
d plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule.  Davis used yester=
day's event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged =
the state for electricity. Yet he lauded San Jose-based Calpine as a sort o=
f energy favorite son.  "They were the first to enter long-term contracts w=
ith us," the governor said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pre=
ssed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overc=
harges, but unlike the others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in nego=
tiations.  "They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us=
," he said.  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of effic=
ient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to ru=
n than their forebears, the state will be paying well above current market =
rates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine.  Calpine Pre=
sident Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is not making e=
xcess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide the electr=
icity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July target dat=
e, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232 a =
megawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.  In addition to the 3=
00 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will supply electricity t=
o the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies.  In t=
he long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a megawatt=
 hour, Cartwright said.  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Reso=
urces, which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled =
under high prices, said Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hou=
r the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts. =
 Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875- m=
egawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is doi=
ng its share to ease the state's supply crunch.  "Ours are the lowest contr=
acts in the state," he said. "If these plants weren't online, we'd be havin=
g blackouts."  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power g=
rid said California is skating so close to blackouts that "every megawatt c=
ounts."  "It's definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so=
 over the summer," said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the Independent S=
ystem Operator.  E-mail Bernadette Tansey at btansey@sfchronicle.com .  ?20=

07/10/state0321EDT0105.DTL   (07-10) 00:21 PDT VANCOUVER, British Columbia =
(AP) --  California has rejected an offer by B.C. Hydro's power trading sub=
sidiary to refund $125 million to settle the state's allegations that it wa=
s overcharged by the Canadian power company.  The dispute will now be resol=
ved by U.S. judicial and regulatory authorities.  The offer from Hydro's Po=
werex subsidiary came during 15 days of settlement talks between power gene=
rators and distributors, California and other western states.  The talks, i=
nitiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates cross=
-border power sales in the United States, concluded Monday evening without =
resolution.  Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Odowichuk said that under the offer, =
the Crown corporation would have been subtracted $125 million from the $290=
 million California still owes British Columbia for power sales.  The $125 =
million was Powerex's first offer and it did not change through the negotia=
tions, she said. The company put conditions on that refund figure, but Odow=
ichuk would not say what those conditions were.  California has charged tha=
t Powerex gouged it by more than $430 million. Odowichuk said Hydro had to =
join the settlement talks to preserve its otherwise lucrative power trading=
 relationship with California.  Electricity imports and exports statistics =
compiled by Canada's National Energy Board show Powerex exported more than =
$900 million worth of energy from January to April.  The average cost of th=
at power was $661.56 a megawatt hour.  Prices have dropped to around $140 a=
 megawatt hour since the regulatory commission instituted price caps on Jun=

acramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of =
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power cris=
is, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of =
the money went elsewhere.  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered le=
ss than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, wh=
ile public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to Californi=
a got the rest.  The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be=
 more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials=
 are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of=
 Texas.  Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not=
 acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure =
and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- =
most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.  Yesterday, =
a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas=
 firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who hav=
e also gouged California.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably h=
ave handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," sai=
d Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.  The latest financial information is co=
ntained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7=
.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.  About $=
5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made =
a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. =
 Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most =
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and =
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropp=
ed as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of even=
ts that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could re=
cover from customers.  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas compa=
nies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2=
 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to tu=
rn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its invest=
igation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt procee=
dings.  Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis.=
 Powerex,  a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC =
Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.  The=
 Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher=
 average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.  E=

der compliance by six other suppliers that have until Tuesday to turn over =
documents.  THE PROBLEM: High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmis=
sion glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in =
the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all fact=
ors in California's electricity crisis.  Southern California Edison and Pac=
ific Gas and Electric say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June 2000 t=
o high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them =
from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it n=
eeds from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy prote=
ction April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the com=
panies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the stat=
e in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million resi=
dential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third =
investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financ=
ial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but is also struggling with high=
 wholesale power costs.  The Public Utilities Commission has approved avera=
ge rate increases of 37 percent for the heaviest residential customers and =
38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for indu=
strial customers and 15 percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to=
 help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.  Track the state'=

/archive/2001/07/10/state0400EDT7473.DTL   (07-10) 01:00 PDT WASHINGTON (AP=
) --  With talks between the state and power generators stalled, California=
 may go to court to help win the $8.9 billion state officials believe it wa=
s overcharged for electricity.  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly =
both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and w=
ill settle for nothing less," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray=
 Davis.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for =
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed n=
o more than $1 billion in refunds.  "The numbers were too far apart," said =
Curtis Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner=
 said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than=
 they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the s=
tate at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $7=
16 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officia=
ls sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not =
made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the stat=
e would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split =
off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had=
 time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FE=
RC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiati=
ons and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission =
ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between pr=
oducers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electr=
icity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and u=
rged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say ar=
e profiteering power companies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but ins=
tead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 perce=
nt of what he stole," said Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-b=
ased Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, howeve=
r, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general co=
unsel for Duke Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces =
$1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of thes=
e settlement talks."  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilit=
ies, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the pr=
oducers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers =
have acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural =
gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  T=
he bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year f=
rom $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated the state could spend a=
s much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that Cali=
fornia's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generat=
ors -- Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. --=
 said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlem=
ent offer."  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as =
part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection fr=
om additional legal claims, said John H. Stout, a company senior vice presi=
dent.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and re=
mains that no refunds are justified."       Toxic fumes not linked to black=

/07/10/MNC115768.DTL   Despite a power-related mishap that released toxic f=
umes from an industrial plant in May, rolling blackouts are not expected to=
 cause dangerous releases in Contra Costa, a county study concludes.  The c=
ounty Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities have ade=
quate backup power plans.  The report to be presented to the Board of Super=
visors today was prompted by a freak traffic accident that knocked out powe=
r at Richmond's General Chemical Corp. plant. When the plant powered back u=
p, a cloud of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released.  Contra Cost=
a hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a pos=
sibility that a plant's hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that=
 those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming o=
nline and the state's successful conservation effort.  He also said industr=
y has done a good job preparing for outages.  "The industry is doing a good=
-faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens=
," Pascalli said.  County officials relied on industry records in determini=
ng the adequacy of the different plans, such as having multiple electrical =
leads feeding a source regulating hazardous materials.  Denny Larson, spoke=
sman for the group Communities for a Better Environment, said the report re=
lied too heavily on industry self-reporting.  "Unfortunately, the conclusio=
ns of the report can't be backed up by the facts," Larson said. "Oil and ch=
emical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to pow=
er failures over the years."  The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oi=
l refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous mate=
rials.  For many of these businesses, the loss of power would shut down the=
ir operations and make it impossible for substances to be released.  Larger=
 facilities, like oil refineries, have either their own backup generators o=
r contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply all or most of their=
 power independent of the electricity power grid, according to the report. =
 Plans are also in place to conduct partial shutdowns at plants running on =
reserve power during a blackout.  General Chemical said all electrical feed=
s to the chamber processing chemicals are automatically pulled in the event=
 of loss of power. A backup generator will automatically come online to kee=
p operations stable.  Dow Chemical has a contract with a Calpine power plan=
t to supply it with electricity. Battery backup and diesel emergency engine=
s are also at the site to ensure enough power to run lights, alarms, contro=
ls and emergency shutdown equipment.  e-mail Jason B. Johnson at jbjohnson@=

 Monday, July 9, 2001  BY JIM PUZZANGHERA   Mercury News Washington Bureau =
   WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree o=
n refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiation=
s ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said=
 the state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.  The judge o=
verseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re=
funds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His=
 estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers dur=
ing negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it w=
as unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and=
 California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At=
 stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have t=
o pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collap=
sed.  Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will =
recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating =
back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=
s such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e=
nergy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  Michael Kahn, who headed t=
he California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects o=
f the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the for=
mula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the num=
bers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billion=
s,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which ru=
ns the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If=
 we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remai=
nder of the money'' through the courts.  Amount in dispute  Power industry =
representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.  ``We haven't gone =
and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere near the $8.9 billion=
,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy =
North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky number that nob=
ody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number.''  Wagne=
r acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying =
he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers=
.  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon=
th when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=
 prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that und=
er pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the =
power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat=
ion.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, par=
ticipants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on =
one end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to=
 splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties ge=
nuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to =
make his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the =
final ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million i=
n refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will a=
sk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed=
 information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun=
d total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any =
refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and=
 its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone =
of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp=
liers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve=
 the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepay=
ers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good=
 faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past=
 the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have th=
e opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California=
 has demonstrated it is owed.''  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a=
 new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis told reporters tha=
t he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order=
 the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn'=
t represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as =
high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures =
were calculated.  John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy W=
holesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.=
9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they wou=
ld continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Ca=
lpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power supp=
liers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi=
ons' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he w=
ill do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. W=
agner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s=
uppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officia=
ls wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $=
8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds =
beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the=
 state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commi=
ssion's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect=
ricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined f=
or each hour of each day. The commission's formula sets a price limit durin=
g Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen=
cy.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University ec=
onomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w=
ill produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.  ``That's the methodology=
 the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market iss=
ues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour, you'll get refund numbers =
on the order of what the state estimated.''    Mercury News Staff Writers B=

Power purchase bills exceed $7.5 billion  Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001,=
 in the San Jose Mercury News  BY MARK GLADSTONE, NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSE=
NBAUM   Mercury News Sacramento Bureau    SACRAMENTO -- Six months after ju=
mping into the electricity business, the Davis administration on Monday pro=
vided the first detailed glimpse of California's daily power purchases, sho=
wing more than $5 billion in payments, much of it to government-owned utili=
ties and private companies that state officials have branded as price gouge=
rs.  The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts a=
nd other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy mar=
kets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week ami=
d a legal dispute over public access to the data.  In roughly the first fiv=
e months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 billion to Atlanta-based M=
irant, the most any company was paid for electricity, followed by $1 billio=
n to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia. It also pa=
id $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The docu=
ments raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen=
 around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the stat=
e's purchases have come from government-run power generators in California =
and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are from the No=
rthwest.  Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, ha=
s put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies =
based in President Bush's home state.  The figures are tucked inside 1,770 =
of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging, saying disclosure w=
ould encourage suppliers to charge more. The state, which last month releas=
ed information on its long-term electricity contracts worth $43 billion, ag=
reed Thursday to release the first quarter details.  Short on explanation  =
The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=
r Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major ut=
ilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the pric=
e of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for wha=
t prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for p=
ower on the spot market was $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $33=
2 and dropped to $271 in May.  One megawatt powers about 750 homes.  Davis =
spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assert=
ions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the out-of=
-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant shift of=
 money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on w=
hether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term=
 power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend=
 that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t=
he state to pay high prices for many years.  Used for support  Republican o=
fficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis,=
 a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as =
the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of th=
e declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants.  ``It's more cle=
ar than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyma=
n Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers=
 for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the v=
olatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour =
ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices f=
rom seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being c=
harged by public utilities and companies outside Texas.  On one day in Febr=
uary, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per mega=
watt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly $500 and=
 Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging up to $575.  The state=
's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including =
the spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-=
January on behalf of the state's major utilities, which were unable to borr=
ow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity.  San J=
ose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants around =
California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth of b=
usiness with the state in the first five months of the year, according to t=
he figures.  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas &=
 Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financia=
lly. PG&E later went into bankruptcy.  On Monday, state lawmakers took anot=
her shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing E=
dison.  While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison =
will not win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have creat=
ed several working groups to come up with alternatives.  Compromise plan  O=
n Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest compro=
mise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses=
 from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the E=
dison bailout.  The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, o=
wed about $1 billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive=
 about $300 million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 =
billion -- about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay o=
ff the remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for =
power.  In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy =
power on the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign ch=
eap energy deals.  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday a=
fternoon, but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receiv=
e in the Legislature.    Contact Mark Gladstone at mgladstone@sjmercury.com=

             Refund outlook dims  Talks break down; judge says state is owe=
d much less than its $8.9 billion demand -- and unpaid bills may offset gai=
ns.  July 10, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Registe=
r  WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California i=
s owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the=
 $8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.  And even at that, said Judge Cu=
rtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power =
bills that in the end California might not see one red cent.  Wagner announ=
ced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after tw=
o weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to California's e=
lectricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now in the commissione=
rs' hands.  Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 mill=
ion in refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billi=
on dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was=
."  For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds=
 is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased pow=
er. And the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of wardi=
ng off future rate increases.  "California will get its $8.9 billion," insi=
sted Michael Kahn, head of the state's delegation and the California Indepe=
ndent System Operator. Kahn brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory =
in the judge's assertion that the state is owed some refunds, a concept the=
 generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now, he said.  Since the t=
alks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week Duke Energ=
y offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed their refun=
d offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the company wer=
e dropped.  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that =
California is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price goug=
ing by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks=
 began.  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the=
 FERC. If unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for ye=
ars.  "You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner sai=
d during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommen=
dation. He has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points du=
ring the often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators=
 and tried to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unpreceden=
ted Sunday session.  "The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.  While =
Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's commen=
ts, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better than a =
jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the state =
has to do all it can to get more than that.  And Davis backed up his team. =
 "Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there we=
re overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably=
, the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibi=
lity to the people of California and own up to their profiteering."  Power =
generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John Stout,=
 vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental position=
 has been and remains that no refunds are justified."  Brent Bailey, genera=
l counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's recommendation, "a fair one."=
  Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=
 energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=
 themselves from the state's refund request.  "I don't believe there really=
 exists a true justification for that number," said Assemblyman John Campbe=
ll, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that anything more than a wild number =
to throw out there."  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of =
overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu=
te the complex pricing structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the ma=
jority of the generators' methods.  To start with, the state is asking for =
$8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be=
tween May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at. FERC issued tw=
o refund orders in March, finding that power companies had $124 million in =
overcharges during power alerts. But the state is challenging that finding,=
 saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times. And the state is=
 also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000.  =
How energy panel affects California  Six months ago, few people had heard o=
f FERC. Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged wi=
th making sure that the nation's power markets are running smoothly and tha=
t wholesale prices are "just and reasonable," rolls off the tongue.  The fi=
ve commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home =
state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that co=
ncluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's ele=
ctricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term pow=
er contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months. FER=
C's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.  WHAT WAS A=
T STAKE?  For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amo=
unt power companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's findi=
ng? There should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.  For the generators:=
 More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills. W=
agner's finding? Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe C=
alifornia. He did not specify by how much.  For California consumers: A sta=
ble electricity market. Until the refund issue is settled and power prices =
are stabilized long term, what the future holds for rate increase remains u=
ncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement. Consumers still in limbo.  HOW D=
ID WE GET HERE?  In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The =
state began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the =
utilities were running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the el=
ectricity they sold. Rolling blackouts began.  Starting in January, the sta=
te began buying the power, replacing the near-bankrupt utilities. Politicia=
ns from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rate=
s. More than $27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year, c=
ompared with $7 billion the year before. The price tag could reach $50 bill=
ion this year.  On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps expert=
s say could moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but =
the caps have caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some =
power off the market.  WHAT'S NEXT?  The FERC commissioners will receive Wa=
gner's report within a week. In it, he will suggest they hold a fast-track =
formal hearing that would last no more than 60 days.  If they agree, after =
that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California mark=
et issues.  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagr=
ee, they can contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could=
 last many years.                State reveals details of power purchases  =
Report shows last-minute energy buys in first three months of 2001.  July 1=
0, 2001  By JENNIFER COLEMAN The Associated Press  SACRAMENTO On three days=
 in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according =
to a report released by state power traders.  The California Department of =
Water Resources released the report Monday, along with 1,770 pages of docum=
ents that also detailed the last- minute power purchases the state made on =
the spot market in the first three months of the year.  The report details =
the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov=
er electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Diego Gas & El=
ectric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bill=
ions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Sin=
ce then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The =
state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest =
daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.  But since May=
, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower n=
atural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered demand and because o=
f increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price man=
ipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts also drove the pric=
e down.  "It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, =
but it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fis=
fis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot-mark=
et prices "underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long=
-term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Mos=
t of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 year=
s.  Davis already has released details of the state's long-term power contr=
acts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several ne=
ws organizations.  But Davis wanted to delay the release of the spot-market=
 buys and short-term contracts until now to keep the state's buying strateg=
y secret.According to the state, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. got $1.24 billi=
on as of May 31 for spot-market purchases.  Canadian Powerex, the marketing=
 arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion.  The newly released short-te=
rm contracts also show that on March 19-20, when the state had rolling blac=
kouts, the state paid above-average prices in its largest short-term contra=
cts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usa=
ge times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt-hour, more than $70 above the aver=
age price of $272.96.                 Tuesday, July 10, 2001        Ghost o=
f Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray Davis is following footsteps of=
 former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN M.W. MOORLACH  Mr. Moorla=
ch is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector.   A recent L.A. Times poll=
 found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers fr=
om a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual cost=
s for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that ever=
ything is fine. It is not.  The state has been spending an average of $57 m=
illion, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now C=
alifornia is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed =
on its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankr=
uptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long befor=
e the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face.  Tha=
t's why I'm gnawed by this "d?j? vu" sensation. The similarities and parall=
els between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. H=
ere's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer Robert Citr=
on, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The "expe=
rts" and the "politicos" were comfortable with the investment scheme.  No w=
onder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieti=
es. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was i=
nvesting and what his "exit strategy" would be. Guess what? The unexpected =
happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of borrowing suddenl=
y exceeded the revenues being generated.  It caused the investment pool to =
implode and Orange County taxpayers realized a $1.64 billion loss. In spite=
 of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he=
 ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, t=
he state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eli=
minated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-ter=
m contracts.  Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for =
electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It d=
epleted the available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are =
imploding. In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis t=
o avoid or minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also his=
tory.  It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of reta=
il rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess=
 what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves!=
 Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in =
the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and onl=
y compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no Libertaria=
n or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He has retu=
rned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California=
 by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equ=
itable way of refunding taxes, but has anyone ever thought up a more effici=
ent method? But, that's not all. He wants it back! Davis now wants to borro=
w some $13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more ele=
ctricity at rates in excess of the retail prices! When does this train wrec=
k in slow motion stop?  And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not wa=
nt to raise rates last summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay o=
ff this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant uti=
lity rate increase. The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davi=
s is gone about his expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants t=
o purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say=
 "no."  If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond=
 buyers will also say "no," unless they receive an attractive interest rate=
. Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just su=
bscribed $800 million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis wa=
lked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangi=

y 10, 2001      Second New Major Base Load Generator for California  SAN JO=
SE, Calif., July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corporati=
on (NYSE: CPN) announced today that its 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Cen=
ter in Pittsburg, Calif. is providing needed electricity to California's st=
rained power grid. Los Medanos is the second major combined-cycle facility =
to be licensed and built in California in over a decade. Fueled by natural =
gas, the facility is designed to add up to 555-megawatts of clean, reliable=
 electricity to California on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week availabil=
ity. As a cogeneration facility, the project also delivers electricity and =
steam to USS POSCO for use in industrial processing.  Governor Gray Davis a=
nd Calpine CEO Peter Cartwright will hold a press conference Monday afterno=
on to commission the Los Medanos Energy Center and to recognize the support=
 of the local community, the construction and trades people, and numerous o=
rganizations that helped develop the facility.  Cartwright said, "We are co=
mmitted to creating innovative energy solutions for California's growing po=
wer market. Los Medanos exemplifies excellence in power generation-ratepaye=
rs and the environment benefit as Calpine brings to California new energy r=
esources like Los Medanos."  Los Medanos is the second of eleven announced =
modern, fuel-efficient energy centers Calpine is building in the State as p=
art of a $6 billion energy initiative. Three additional facilities are unde=
r construction, including an 880-megawatt facility in Pittsburg at Dow Chem=
ical's facility. By year-end 2005, Calpine expects to be generating 12,000 =
megawatts of clean, affordable electricity to help repower California.  Cal=
pine broke ground on the Los Medanos Energy Center in September 1999. More =
than 600 construction and trade personnel worked on the project over a 20-m=
onth period. During the past several months, the project scheduled two ten-=
hour shifts, seven days a week to get the plant operating as soon as possib=
le in light of the energy crisis. And over the past several weeks, technica=
l teams worked round the clock to complete the facility. The total cost of =
construction is estimated to be approximately $350 million.  The Los Medano=
s Energy Center is located in Pittsburg, Calif., in Contra Costa County adj=
acent to the USS POSCO plant and is operated by a 22-member staff of highly=
 trained personnel.  As with all of Calpine's modern base load facilities, =
Los Medanos uses combined-cycle design with natural gas-fired turbines in c=
ombination with a steam turbine to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. Advance=
d emissions control technology enables Calpine to reduce certain emissions =
by more than 90 percent.  Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is=
 dedicated to providing customers with reliable and competitively priced el=
ectricity. Calpine is focused on clean, efficient, natural gas-fired genera=
tion and is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy. Ca=
lpine has launched the largest power development program in North America. =
To date, the company has approximately 34,000 megawatts of base load capaci=
ty and 7,200 megawatts of peaking capacity in operation, under construction=
, pending acquisitions and in announced development in 29 states, the Unite=
d Kingdom and Canada. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly trade=

7/10/2001  The New York Times  Page 14, Column 1  c. 2001 New York Times Co=
mpany  WASHINGTON, July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiat=
ions about California 's demands for electricity refunds today, with the st=
ate and power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the t=
alks began.  The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving=
 the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which=
 the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab=
out $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it =
would seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although e=
lectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis =
that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be=
 resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should hav=
e cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an ac=
counting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly=
 overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2=
0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators=
 say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's es=
timates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlem=
ent talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the fed=
eral agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c=
omprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would =
recommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti=
ary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he w=
ould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under =
federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and =
reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year th=
at California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began=
 imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o=
f past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains =
uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than=
 for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 bil=
lion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California sho=
uld have paid for power since last September, when the commission began mon=
itoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroact=
ively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated t=
hat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is=
 closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar=
d by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recom=
mending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''mayb=
e a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju=
dge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled=
ged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that wha=
tever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option o=
f seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' s=
aid Michael Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talk=
s. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder =
in the courts.''  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did =
not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue=
 generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generato=
rs, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said,=
 speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California=
 .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se=
ttlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 m=
illion. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w=
ould result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their =
offer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they no=
w hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t=
hreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol=
lars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially press=
ed utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.  ''We =
remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that =
will put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said Brent Bailey, vice=
 president and general counsel of Duke Energy.       Financial  Energy Refu=
nd Talks Fail In Calif.; Federal Agency's Judge To Propose Settlement Peter=
 Behr    07/10/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001, =
The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  California consumers were over=
charged by as much as $1 billion by electricity suppliers since October, a =
federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power=
 suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges.  Gov. Gray=
 Davis (D) and California power officials wanted $8.9 billion in refunds da=
ting back to May 2000, when the state's energy crisis began.  A group of ge=
nerating companies headed by units of Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc=
. and Williams Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, goi=
ng back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg=
er amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  "The nu=
mbers were too far apart," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed neg=
otiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i=
mprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f=
igure.  Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec=
ted to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  "A lot=
 of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't," Wagner told =
reporters. "There's an old southern saying," said the 72-year-old Tennessea=
n. "You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."  He declin=
ed to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California offic=
ials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his=
 own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula=
 essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul=
d have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel c=
osts and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refun=
d, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considera=
ble weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier=
 this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first =
three months of this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.  Facing=
 increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members =
appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's pow=
er prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholes=
ale power transactions in California and 10 other western states. Wagner pa=
tterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.  The nation's wealthies=
t state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas =
prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $7 billion in 1999 to=
 an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not retreat from reco=
rd levels until last month.  Davis's top aides quickly claimed vindication =
yesterday.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are goin=
g to be in the multiple billions," said Michael Kahn, chairman of the Calif=
ornia Independent System Operator, the state's power grid manager.  Kahn no=
ted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against t=
he principal energy suppliers, most of them headquartered outside the state=
. The companies had insisted on being released from the state's legal claim=
s as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the negotiations=
.  "We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for =
the remainder," Kahn said. " California will get its $8.9 billion."  But th=
e state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief market moni=
tor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state =
generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion=
 using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 bill=
ion goal.  Duke Energy is "very pleased'' by Wagner's action, said Brent Ba=
iley, vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company. Th=
e generators, however, repeated their claims that Davis is trying to make t=
hem scapegoats for the state's failed electricity deregulation plan.  The m=
ajor generators, in a statement yesterday, said they had delivered only 20 =
million megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used fro=
m October 2000 to last May. (A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750=
 homes.)  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped la=
rge profits, the generators said.  "The refunds sought by California would =
send a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers: when prices are l=
ow and surpluses exist, you face a steep downside; when scarcity develops a=
nd prices rise we will take away all upside [profit]. No one will invest [i=
n California power facilities] in that climate," the generators' statement =
said. "The power supply shortage thus will continue without relief."   http=

  Economy   California and Energy Companies Miss Deadline By Richard B. Sch=
mitt    07/10/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Copyright (c) 2001, =
Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company=
 executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of =
disputed California electricity charges, as a federal mediator overseeing t=
he talks suggested the state's demand was excessive.  Cautioning that he ha=
dn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrati=
ve law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put the level of =
potential refunds at "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion doll=
ars." He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies it=
s insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.  Mr. Wagner said he would =
recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from Octobe=
r -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line=
 with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That decision alone would shav=
e $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.  Mr. Wagner, who is expected to i=
ssue formal findings in the next few days, said he would recommend that the=
 FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring=
 refunds.  The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals late=
r between energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcha=
rging for power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers=
 indicated a willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two "parti=
al" settlements were in the works.  Yet, absent any such solution, the over=
charge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to b=
e resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings, which could drag=
 on for months or even years.  The negotiations began June 25, with a deadl=
ine set for midnight last night. But late yesterday, participants indicated=
 they were billions of dollars apart, with basic differences over everythin=
g from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered=
 the talks, could enforce a deal because of the industry's questions about =
the reach of the agency's authority.  "We haven't reached a settlement. We =
really haven't come close," said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli=
ant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay Califor=
nia about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight. That is more than=
 a third of the Houston company's operating profit during the relevant peri=
od, he said, although far shy of the more than $375 million California soug=
ht from Reliant.  Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 mill=
ion to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the =
agency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwate=
r, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito=
ring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some com=
panies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $12=
4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu=
ary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER=
C members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to =
act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda=
y, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at the sett=
lement, declared he was "gratified" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they v=
alidated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rej=
ected at the talks' outset. "We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of=
 refunds and we'll get back lots of money," he said, adding that what the s=
tate doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power genera=
tors, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as "ludicrous" and =
"unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The state came away=
 with far less than its expectations," said Robert Loeffler, an attorney fo=
r a unit of AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. "The common expectation now is that=
 any refunds will be way below this $9 billion."=09

Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to Jeremy about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.  I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.  Let me know if I'm missing something here.  Again, apologize for keeping on about it.

Just a reminder that the contract we signed with Ken Smith is set to expire at the end of October. Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties.  


Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month.  Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. 


Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice.  
  
If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract).


Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks

Quick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.

The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

By Jason Leopold=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

Generators, including Mirant Corp. ( MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investm=

p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought app=
arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the "pulse" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.

Dear Everyone,
 
I will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th.  It's a homey room and extremely artist-friendly, so far off the corporate path that the owner doesn't advertise or even publish the address on the web.  Of course, it's not so homey that you can't get a drink, and it's close enough to the pulse that artists like Shawn Mullins still appear there regularly.  For those of you wary of crossing the Bay Bridge, it really isn't all that far (20-30 minutes), and this may be your last chance to catch my act this year.  Here are the details:

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Best,
Jeff

Mike, Jeanne and Bob....the draft looks good...I have noted a few possible
changes and one question.  Let's discuss at your convenience.
 
With regard to interest, APSES asked for an audit.  Why don't we at least
ask for interest and use it at least as a trading point to get the
calculation after Jan. 18 pinned down.

Jeff,

My biggest concern is that we draw attantion to our QF contracts and there is pressure for us to give up our capacity payment or the CPUC futher dilutes our energy payment. I also don't think it makes sense to attack the large companies that have the DWR contracts. We generally end up working together on various issues and I do n't want to damage the relationships. I agree with many of the points John makes, but I don't want to be identified with the letter.

Enron Wind also needs to see an Edison MOU bill passed so we can get paid our past due amounts and get our five year fixed energy price on our ISO4 contracts. I plan to be in Sacramento the next couple of days and will stop by Governmental Advocates.

Regards,

Hap

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

We will be forwarding a video of Tuesday's Dunn hearing to you by Monday.
The transcript should take a few more days.  I ran by Bowen's office this
morning to see if they've planned anything for next year but they weren't
there.  I'll try again.

Professor:
Thanks for the response.  However, I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos.  Since it is still October 31, I hope you'll discard that copy and replace it with this one, which I think is now typo-free.  My apologies for the mix-up and thanks for your consideration.  You'll note that this copy is dated "1031,"  whereas the previous copy was dated "1029."

Thanks very much.  Greatly appreciated. In response:

--I'm going to stick with 7 units.  Just don't have the time to take on another course.  But appreciate the info and the suggestion.

--I have a backup for Deals.

Hi Jeff,

I'm looking at your transcript and you've already completed 30 
units.  You're taking 7 units this semester for a total of 37 units.  You 
need 40 units to graduate.

You may want to consider adding a 3-unit this semester.  Or next semester 3 
units will cost about half, $6000.  4 or more units full price.  Just let 
me know if you want to add another class, but you may not have the time!

Just ask at our front desk, and we'll make you a copy of your latest 
transcript.

You can go to the Deals class tonight, even though you're #17 on the 
waiting list.  I'll update the status on Friday.  You may want to have a 
back-up!

See you,
TJ

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.

Best,
Jeff

Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.

Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.

That work?

Best,
Jeff

He believes his interests are aligned with Jeremy's.  He is TOTALLY on board with our approach -- agrees that we must try to get DA reinstated.  He said we have the worst of all possible worlds right now -- no DA and uncertain rules.  He realizes hedging is a problem with the uncertain rules but can deal with it.

Thanks, very much Alan.  Hedy, Bev and Scott are still technically on board until the end of the month, but that's fairly "ceremonial," so to speak.  Let's do this.  I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.  Sound reasonable?

Thanks, Dan.  I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have a=
ny choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer u=
p any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to attem=
pt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due proce=

Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that E=
SPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commissio=
n by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who =
sign a "suitable" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow=
:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct acc=
ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc=
t access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shal=
l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme=
nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A failure =
to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be consi=
dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a=
nd agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual =
contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's Doc=
ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.<?xm=
l:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /=
>

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e=
xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect=
ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be =
submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =20

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w=
ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order=
 and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission =
staff by December 11, 2001.=20

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons=
e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja=
nuary 4, 2002.


As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name=
s, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and WPTF=
 are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they=
 wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this=
 Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering our =
options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very prelimina=
ry analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o=
ver either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also particula=
rly outrageous because of the statements that, "A failure to submit this in=
formation for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of=
 the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements=
" and "Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag=
reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement=
s are in effect."  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat=
ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor=
s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend=
ent customers. =20
=20
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is t=
ime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPU=
RR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Gove=
rnor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be very=
 much appreciated.

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right."
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

Best,
Jeff

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for. We had a good talk. I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.

Best,
Jeff

Dear Friends,
=20
Today, a very delicate and beautiful bouquet of flowers was delivered to me=
 from Enron Government Affairs.  It is a bouquet of blooming orchids, purpl=
e hydrangia, pink roses and one yellow rose.  It is a delicate and beautifu=
l arrangement of flowers that remind me of my relationship with Jude Moussa=
.
=20
Jude was an emissions broker for Cantor Fitzgerald and worked on the 104th =
floor of the North Tower at the World Trade Center.  Jude and I met last Ap=
ril while I was working at Enron Global Markets.  In addition to sharing so=
me wonderful times together in Houston and New York City, we talked often. =
 Last Friday morning, Jude called me to say hello - one last time. =20
=20
My friend was a kind and considerate man with a gentle heart.  The irony of=
 his life is that he and his family fled Lebanon in the eighties to escape =
the war there. =20
=20
Jude's world is now a world of eternal love and peace.  And his spirit will=
 be kept alive by the memories that his family and friends share with each =
other, and with those of you who didn't have the joy of knowing him persona=
lly.
=20
Your flowers, your comforting words, and your friendship have eased my sadn=
ess these past few days.  Since yesterday, I have been in contact with Jude=
's family and I have relayed to them the outpouring of prayers and sympathy=
 that are directed at their son and the other victims of this terrible trag=
edy.
=20
Setting aside my grief, I hope that your own sorrow and loss are eased in t=
he presence of family and friends. =20
=20
Love,  Janel

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Hey Great to hear from you.

I CAN BE REACHED AT 415-713-4473 (this is my cell
phone and you can reach me on it anytime.)

I was just going to call you.  I just left the Yankee
Group and am looking for my next opportunity.  That
gig was just not working out for me and I decided to
move on. Tina and I are now living in Albuquerque NM
and searching for some new opportunities.  I'd love to
get back to California, but am looking elsewhere as
well.   

Hope all is well.  Take care.

Give me a ring sometime.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

I do not know for sure which one) need to file their $1000 fee and their

Subject:	Intention to Challenge the California's PUC's Decision to Suspend DA

?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

This is very sad.  Prentice (now one of PWC's finest) and I talked and here's where I come out.  I love Annie and want to remember her the way she is.  And I bet she would feel the same way.  All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.  It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for Annie, and everyone else, is for Annie to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.  I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to pass on the 6 o'clock phone call.  I hope you understand.  I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her.

Best,
Jeff

We need to have a conference call all together tonight to discuss how to
move forward with Annie.  She has cancer and without treatment would
probably live only a few weeks.  Chemotherapy could prolong her life
reasonably comfortably from 6 months to a year.  The minimum cost would be
about $1,500.  I think it would be best if we all got on the phone together
around 6 - does that work for all of you??

Nice job.  In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision? Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.  Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.  Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.

Best,
Jeff

Dorothy -- Attached is a another version of the letter that takes a little
different approach.  What do you think?  I worried that your first letter
looks a little like an invitation to pile on the exit fees, of all types and
in any magnitude.  I think we need to attack the premise that any DA causes
an increase in DWR costs for other customers.  Bill

Greetings Dan:  Few things.

Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.  Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start meeting with them.
Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers?
Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?

Have a great holiday weekend.

Best,
Jeff

The Senate Rules Committee just met.  During the hearing, Senate Leader John Burton stated that:
the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).
the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to Edison and Davis, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.
If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature.
Burton generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.
Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.  More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

We must go after this. I need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do. I see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently:

- a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August

- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension

- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions

Suggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance

Subject:	Golf - November Direct Report Meeting 

Howdy Golfers,

Tee times have been arranged on the East Course (18 holes of golf) at the Broadmoor for Thursday, November 8 (tee times: 1:40pm & 1:48pm).  The price for playing this course is actually $90; slightly cheaper than what is indicated below.  I have arranged for each of your golf charges to be charged to your individual rooms.  Please refer to the list below for additional charges such as, clubs & shoe charges.   I'm hoping to finalize all the activity choices by the end of the week, so please confirm by COB tomorrow Thursday, October 18 that your activity choice will remain golf.

Thanks!

Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
Jeff

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Governor Chicken

10/22/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The two politicians who've arguably benefited most from the national focus =
on war are both Californians -- Congressman Gary Condit and Governor Gray D=
avis. Too bad Mr. Davis is finding he still can't avoid his own chickens co=
ming home to roost.=20
Only now are the folks in Sacramento learning that their Governor's "soluti=
on" to the energy crisis has been a political sham. A combination of collap=
sing budget revenues, foolish spending and bad credit ratings threatens to =
plunge the state into a full-fledged financial crisis.
Governor Davis's chickens left the roost back in May 2000, when California'=
s botched scheme to deregulate electric power encountered a wicked price bu=
bble. Wholesale prices, which had been deregulated, shot up, while retail p=
rices, which were still regulated, didn't budge. This mismatch, along with =
other factors, generated huge supply disruptions and a first-class energy c=
risis.=20
The obvious response would have been to let retail rates rise with the mark=
et price. Mr. Davis said so himself in his now infamous observation that if=
 he raised rates, the problem would be solved in 20 minutes. Mr. Davis pref=
erred to play the blame game, including a lot of whining that he had inheri=
ted the situation.=20
While the Governor complained, California's two largest utilities were push=
ed into insolvency and neighboring states endured the double whammy of havi=
ng their power sucked into California and seeing their electric rates shoot=
 up. Californians suffered through rolling blackouts.=20
Finally, this past January -- eight months after the energy crisis began --=
 the Governor responded: Retail rates were increased twice, and the state s=
tarted to purchase power directly from suppliers, using money from its gene=
ral fund. At the same time, the state negotiated contracts with suppliers a=
t prices that are now well above market prices and for terms as long as 20 =
years.=20
And then Mr. Davis got lucky. Although the forecast was for a summer of con=
tinued blackouts generated by a strong demand for power, the disaster faile=
d to materialize. Not only was the weather cooler than normal, but higher r=
ates produced immediate conservation; thus demand was moderate and power su=
fficient. Newsweek went out and hailed the Governor as a political Lazarus.=
=20
But now here come the chickens. It seems that almost one-quarter of Califor=
nia's budget revenues were provided by taxpayers with stock options and cap=
ital gains, mostly from Silicon Valley companies. When the dot-com industry=
 started to implode, so did revenue projections -- to $12 billion this year=
, down from $18 billion last year. And this was before September 11 and the=
 collapse in the Nasdaq market.=20
California would probably be able to absorb this revenue hit were it not fo=
r the still outstanding bills from the Governor's electric power fiasco. Co=
nsider the toll:=20
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for the $14 billion that the utilities =
owe to suppliers for power consumed before the state started buying electri=
city.=20
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the $12.5 billion bond issue that Cal=
ifornia hopes to float to replenish the money borrowed from its general fun=
d.=20
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for those expensive, long-term contract=
s that the state negotiated.=20
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of $4.3 billion that =
California got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering. (If t=
his loan is not repaid by November 1, its interest rate jumps to 7% from 4%=
, resulting in an extra $250,000 in interest payments a day.)=20
Whether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers, or s=
ome combination of the two, the impact on California's economy and its budg=
et will be dreadful. Observers are estimating a budget deficit of almost $1=
0 billion for next year.=20
As for Governor Davis, the problems of the "previous administration" are no=
w his own. And Californians know it. A recent statewide poll showed that mo=
st voters preferred the former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, the l=
eading Republican challenger to Mr. Davis, by several points.=20
The Governor's response to the ever-worsening economic situation has been t=
ypical. He complains. He vetoes a few spending bills. He announces a $5 mil=
lion campaign to persuade Californians to help the local economy by staying=
 in-state for their vacations. We expect to see a lot of chickens on surfbo=
ards.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Subject: EPUC Comments re DWR Decision


Attached are EPUC's comments opposing the draft decision.  They argue that, "The DD implicitly overstates the Commission's obligation under these provisions and, consequently, risks the public interest.  While the Commission must assure recovery of the costs incurred by DWR, the statute does not require the Commission to assure full recovery of a fixed value in the face of variable assumptions.  Failing to address these variables could lead to unnecessary rate increases and further injury to the state's economy.  Moreover, while the Commission must adopt a "stop gap" allocation of DWR costs among utilities to determine who will make the payments, there is statutory requirement or practical  need for a final, absolute allocation to be adopted before a more careful examination can be made."
 
EPUC concludes by saying that it, "urges the Commission to tailor narrowly its decision adopting a DWR revenue requirement.  The Commission should adopt a mechanism, as described herein, that would limit or eliminate the difference between DWR actual costs and utility remittances.  The Commission should also adopt only an interim inter-utility allocation, to be reconciled with a final methodology pending a careful and thorough examination of cost responsibility."

Looks like Prentice and Nancy will be getting together in Napa to do a little bonding this weekend.  Therefore, it looks like an opportunity to golf on Saturday or Sunday (screw football).  Any takers?  (Eldon has promised not to be the score Nazi.)

Interesting.  What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks.

Edison pact could point way for PG&E 
The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. 
It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. 
The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. 
Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. 
One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. 
From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. 
It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. 
"It's definitely ambiguously worded," said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. 
"There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers," Linsey said. 
The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. 
In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. 
And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. 
About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. 
Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. 
The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. 
Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. 
"In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers," said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. 
But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. 
No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? 
Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. 
The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. 
"People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. "It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'" 
The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. 
That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. 
They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. 
"They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. 
For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. 
"I think it would be smarter to be talking now," he said. 
A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. 
Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. 
"We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power," Cohen said. 
Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. 
Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. 
At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. 
It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. 
"It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this," said Florio, the consumer advocate. "This could be the beginning of something really ugly." 
In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.

Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with Edison.  1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?

You think I should submit the reimbursement now, before the semester ends, just to get it in the door?

They should reserve a place for Fessler at the same place Davis deserves to go--history's trash heap.  You know that Fessler works with Klauberg, right?  Some people you just can't get rid of....

I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g., oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc.

USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language
that was added at the end of the first sentence and not replace it
unless we can get a clearer statement from Jeff of what he means.
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer? Barbara

Hi Avram.  Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  Rory and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.

Subject:	Colorful Dissent from Two PUC Commissioners Opposed to Suspending DA

Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  

Happy 4th to all.

Best,
Jeff

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

I frankly have put NO creadance into their timeline.   Until the investment banks / commercial banks get in and assess whether there is an exit financing that is sufficient to take out the "just pay me nows" they are nowhere.   This will drag out.  The capital markets could not be more choppy to launch this discussions than right now.

Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.

Subject: ML Power Group-EIX-Update Following Meeting With Management


* We met with Edison management on Friday (10/12) to discuss the recently
announced settlement agreement between the company and the CPUC.  The
agreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for
Edison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume
power procurement responsibilities.
* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be
recovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a
bridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.
* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides
apparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be
timing of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will
likely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas
prices.
* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated
settlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which
Edison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action
to recover alleged generator overcharges.
* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree
on the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially
release Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as
opposed to through the PX/ISO.
* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few
weeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.
* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether
or not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up
as a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility
retained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.
* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about
the earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are
sticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and
$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential
upside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are
restored under the terms of the settlement agreement.
* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average
multiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although
clarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst.

Shirleen:

Can I have your fax number so that I can fax you my comments?  Also, I've added two slides (see attached).  They don't have to be included, but I think they might provide some additional value to the conference folks.  If you have questions, just let me know.	

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

        Jeanne,  I understand from Keith Melville that you were looking for 
various pieces of SDG&E's May 18, 2001 filing in our Revenue Shortfall 
Surcharge Application (A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044).  I have included in the 
attached note the entire SDG&E filing.  Hopefully, you will be able to find 
in the package the information/data you are seeking.  Recognize that there 
were some corrections made on the stand by some of the witnesses.  I would 
recommend that you check the transcript for those corrections. 

        Also, Keith tells me you also wanted a copy of Exhibit #38.  Jim Hay

will send it to you in a separate e-mail. 

        Please let us know, if you need further documents in this 
proceeding.  Have a great day!

Every Monday at 10:30 AM (Houston time), which is, more or less, a company-wide call.
Every Wednesday at 1:30 PM (Houston time), which is a Government Affairs-only call.

Those are it.  If there's anything else, just let me know.

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.

FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.

Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. 

Best,
Jeff
  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Additional suggestions from Mike Day:

5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.

6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.

Why does Edison care about DWR stranded costs?  Are these the costs of the bonds or the above market long-term contracts?

In terms of our proposal, went over it with Wanda and Michael last week, and they, I believe, ran it by Swain.  The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?  We need all of that to better evaluate our risks/costs of serving those customers.  Thanks for your help.

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
*****************************************************************
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's going to get very interesting from here.

Best,
Jeff

Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to Jeremy about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.  I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.  Let me know if I'm missing something here.  Again, apologize for keeping on about it.

FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.

I'm back from the doctor.  I'll just take the time against lunch (i.e., I'll work through lunch), so no need to worry about any time accounting.  If there's any issues with that approach, just let me know.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Socal Window Meeting

\Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts?

Just wanted to make sure that you have seen the announcement about the move, the meeting (on the 18th) they're having to explain and the brief description.  If not, let me know and I'll fax it to you.  And unless you have any objections, I'm seriously considering attending the meeting, since this has been one of the biggest problems we've had in the gas industry in California.  Let me know.

Best,

Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes.
In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron.
This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions.
A story related to the deal is attached.
If you have any questions, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
"It took too long to bring this to resolution," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. "I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt." 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges," Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
"Let's hope cooler minds prevail," said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California," said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there," he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt "smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court." 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

Getting a little concerned that Borenstein might be on vacation--haven't heard back yet.  Will let you know just as soon as I find out.

Subject:        SBX2 78 - Update 

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on 
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed, 
some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee 
members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by 
TURN and other consumer groups. 

During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and 
Richard Katz from the Governor's office regarding a couple of issues 
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more 
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently, 
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff's request.  D.J. agreed that the bill 
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA 
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about 
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying 
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to 
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too 
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct 
access.  We suggested that "shall" be changed to "may" in order to give more 
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn't necessarily oppose 
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can 
totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do). 

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to 
push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this 
bill passes. 

There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor's 
desk. 

The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote on 
additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.

Based upon the discussion in our last meeting, we would suggest the need for increased coverage of the following areas:

1. PG&E's Gas Accord 
2. PG&E's attempt to switch backbone jurisdiciton to FERC through the bankruptcy proceeding
3. Movement in Socal's GIR or other plans to open its backbone to firm transport
4. Socal's RLS tariff and requests to reduce the cost allocation to that service.
5. Socal WACOG filings, calculations
6. Tariff changes that provide for backhaul service from SDG&E/North Baja to Socal territory

Jeff - this is just a cursory list. Our real need is to have information that comes from a proactive stance in the regulatory processes.  

Please call  Barry or myself if you have any questions.

Regards,

Stephanie

Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary thing?

Best,
Jeff

I like it for 2 reasons:
 
1.    The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical.
 
2.    If we got this "gift", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.
 
Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.

Assembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would
grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using
reclaimed water.  The bill is in its infancy and none of the details have
been worked out.  His office would like to know if Enron would be interested
in providing technical assistance with the measure.  They approached Enron
because of the Roseville plant, recognizing that Roseville already has its
air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water.

Thoughts?

Meeting with PG&E went OK... they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.  PROGRESS I guess.... 

Flights were good.. got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day... 

IF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on.. .that would be great.

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

Sue will take the lead on the ARM filing.  Let's discuss further the idea of a separate Enron filing--pros and cons to each.  Sue and Jeanne Bennett discussed and thought coalition filings would be preferable, but let's talk about it.

DWP Far Exceeded Profit It Reported
--------------------

Energy: An independent audit finds the utility's return was double the 15% the agency said it made selling power during the crisis. Officials deny price gouging.

By DOUG SMITH, RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ
Times Staff Writers

September 10 2001

During the peak of California's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged, according to a newly completed independent audit.

The document, obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act, seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes.

The audit also undercuts efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private, out-of-state generating companies.

For months, DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15% above its costs.

As recently as July, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, repeated that assurance in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown.

But the audit findings show that DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56% last year under Freeman's stewardship.

Overall, during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, records show that the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million. It says it is still owed $180 million.

Beyond those higher profits, the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity.

They include a $34-million cut for the city's general fund--essentially a bonus for the utility's owner--and an additional $42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency's capital investments.

These overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators.

In effect, unsuspecting ratepayers across the state, whose utilities have been battered by debt, are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay.

In an interview late last week, Freeman defended those costs and DWP's profits, saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants.

He insisted that he had issued "standing orders" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15%.

"We made a fair amount of money. It was not price gouging," said Freeman, who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year.

Freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15%, then "I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at [the] DWP."

The DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs, said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freeman's tenure.

"Maybe in hindsight," Wiggs said, "it would have been better not to be so specific, but to say, 'Look we're gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers.' "

Still, Wiggs said, even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. "We charged just and reasonable rates," he said, adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin.

Wiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity.

Conducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the study targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000. The results have provided critics with new ammunition.

"Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair," said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union. "This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks, savings and loans and insurance companies--not a public agency."

Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the crisis, was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWP's profits were limited to 15%.

"This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny," he said after learning of the audit. "It would be ironic if it turns out that the L.A. Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov. Davis' 'Texas Pirates,' " said Thompson.

The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the state's deregulation of electricity began to backfire, with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding.

To keep the power flowing, the DWP--which had opted out of deregulation--cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market.

This helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced.

At the same time, however, the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis, official reports would later show. Freeman repeatedly said the utility's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly, inefficient plants.

But the audit raises such serious questions about the DWP's behavior that the matter has spilled into the 2002 gubernatorial contest.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a possible Republican challenger to Davis, last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure.

In a letter to his successor, James K. Hahn, the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling.

If so, he said, the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated $180 million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales.

A Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity.

"The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales," said Jaime de la Vega, a senior advisor to Riordan's campaign committee.

Freeman, now squarely in the Davis camp, disputes Riordan's account. He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agency's pricing strategy.

He wanted to charge more, according to Freeman, in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, which were slipping into insolvency.

Freeman described Riordan's view as: "If we're gonna continue to sell it to them, we ought to get a lot of money. He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it."

For the most part, the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in California's haywire energy market. Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market, including his agency.

But according to a report by the state's grid operator, DWP was one of the most aggressive, along with the trading arm of BC Hydro, the government-owned utility in British Columbia.

Yet another report--this one by the state's power-buying agency--found that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year.

The report said DWP charged an average of $292 per megawatt hour, asking more than many private generators.

It could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher.

Even after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year, the DWP collected profits more than 40% higher than it claimed to have netted, records show.

Overall, during the 13-month period audited, profits averaged 29%, double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving.

Although Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers, Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities.

One key question is whether those agencies, like private suppliers, should be forced to refund excess profits.

The primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged.

DWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction. But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities.

The leading proponent of that course is state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).

In a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month, he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are "merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies."

The chairman of that committee, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead.

No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

Best,
Jeff

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

*	Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
*	Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
*	Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
*	Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
*	In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
*	When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
*	Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
*	And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
*	Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.

Greetings:
I just talked to Marcie.  She's interested, but wants some more info to examine before setting up a meeting.  Aren't there some press articles about the sort of muni partnerships you want to pursue with SMUD and Anaheim?  Do we have anything else that I can email to her to wet her whistle for the meeting?  Will get back to you very soon about meeting with Schori at SMUD.

check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)

Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.

It was $100 for each couple for everything. But you got a lot of people onto

P.S. I agree with everything that guy said in the article you sent out. 
Pacifism is just not feasible in most situations. The world can be too

That's exactly right.  But I would say that Loretta, not Brown, was the winner, and will continue to be the winner.

It was held only after Brown insisted that it be held and only after Loretta
took a voice vote to over-rule Brown's hold.  Duque and Bilas joined Brown
in taking the item off the agenda.  I saw Brown this morning.  He's pissed
and he called Loretta a liar.  Somehow, he knew what was going to happen and
he prevented it.

You're right about the secondary market.  The Commission imposes a 120%
limit on everyone.  The problem is, this is unenforceable.  Marketers will
just bundle transportation with commodity and inflate the commodity price to
extract the transportation premium.  This happened a few ago on the
interstates when FERC tried the same thing.

Thanks so much for the call back.  Here it is.  It's got temperature and %RH from end of May to early November.  Couple of things.  I tried to keep and save heat days (cumulative) on the graph, but for some reason, it won't stick.  I'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph.  If not, let me know. 

Also, the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end (to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property, and before I was able to download it in November).  Once you get a chance to look at, give a call and let me know what you think.  

If the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines, I'll want to get Terry Rosetti up to do some soil testing, but wanted to get your take on the temperature, etc. first.  Really appreciate all your help.  My number is 415.782.7822.

Jeff,
Thanks, in advance, for your help with this.  The project is a "Corporate Responsibility Stakeholder Perception Survey" designed to gather baseline information on how our stakeholders view the issue of corporate social responsibility in general, and Enron in that regard in our major markets US, UK and Japan. Stakeholders are defined as those who are affected by our business, can affect our business or have an interest in Enron - customers, suppliers, governments, regulators, NGOs, employees, shareholders, etc.

What I would like from you is which stakeholders you think are important to include from Enron Corp's perspective here in California, and the job title or name therein. Please just take 5 minutes or so to list them, don't spend any longer than that.

CPUC - who?
CEC - who?
any others... 

I already have the major environmental organizations, but if you think TURN or others should be included, let me know.

Thanks so much!
Catherine

In terms of our proposal, went over it with Wanda and Michael last week, and they, I believe, ran it by Swain.  The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Calif Consumer Group Steps Up Opposition To SoCal Ed Bill    
Updated: Monday, August 27, 2001 04:55 PM ET     
  


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Three weeks before the state legislature adjourns, a California consumer group is stepping up efforts to oppose a rescue deal for Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) insolvent utility Southern California Edison, a spokesman for The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said Monday. 

The group has set up a war room in a hotel one block from the state's capitol, which it will use to organize citizen volunteers from around the state. The volunteers, who will wear black and yellow armbands for easy identification, will meet with lawmakers and report on legislative developments to the media and to community groups, said spokesman Doug Heller. 


   

"We want politicians to know they are being watched and that an Edison bailout is unacceptable," Heller said. 

A bill is currently being heard by an Assembly committee to rescue SoCal Ed by allowing it to issue up to $2.9 billion in bonds backed by ratepayer revenue. The utility has $3.5 billion in undercollections because it couldn't pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze. 

The foundation, which believes the bill will result in rate increases beyond the two already instituted this year, is setting up a telephone line with near-daily updates on legislative developments, Heller said. 

The consumer group plans to sponsor a 2002 ballot measure to overturn an Edison bill if it passes. In the past, the group has helped overturn legislation on property taxes and insurance rates through ballot initiatives. 

"We've done some test mailing on this and have had a real positive response from the public. We're ready to do a mail-based campaign if the legislature screws up," Heller said. 

About 25,000 people have already signed an online "anti-bailout" petition, according to the foundation's Web site.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Jeff

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Subject: PG&E's Gas Accord II application
Importance: High


Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
application.

If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415)

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

Jeff

Legislative Weekly 
September 6, 2001 
Issue 35, Volume 3 

A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento





ELECTRICAL RESTRUCTURING 

SBX2 78 (Polanco D-Los Angeles and Sher D-Stanford).  CMTA supports this bill to allow Southern California Edison to collect $2.9 billion from customers to cover excess power costs incurred between May 2000 and January 2001.  While the debt can only be assessed against customers over 20kw in demand, provisions protecting the right to direct access and customer generation overcome our objections to the disproportionate spread of debt. The bill will be on the assembly floor this week. 

SBX2 27 (Bowen D-Marina del Rey).  This direct access bill remains a potential vehicle for reinstatement of direct access if SBX2 78 fails.  It failed to gain 2/3 votes in the Senate last June. CMTA did not support the bill, but remains willing to work with the author. 

SBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco).  CMTA supports this bill to create a separate revenue stream for payment of state energy revenue bonds, saving financing costs and simplifying the relationship between bonds and Department of Water Resources power contracts.  Passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability. 

SBX2 85 (Burton).  CMTA opposes this bill to repeal the sunset on the 10% rate discount for small commercial and residential customers that was created by AB 1890.  It passed out of Assembly EC&A. 
  

NATURAL GAS EXIT FEES 

ABX2 23 (Pescetti R-Rancho Cordova) requires non-core customers to make long-term projections regarding their firm service gas delivery needs, and would allow utilities to impose exit fees on non-core customers that do not later desire that firm service level. 

CMTA is opposed unless exit fees are removed. CMTA supports amendments to simply require the PUC to study the state's natural gas infrastructure to determine ways in which to expand capacity and increase competition.  The bill has not yet been set for hearing in Senate Energy Utilities and Communications. 
  

ELECTRICAL GENERATION - EMINENT DOMAIN 

ABX2 35 (Vargas D-San Diego) authorizes the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority to exercise eminent domain to acquire generating facilities for 18-24 months.  Generators would be reimbursed a "reasonable rental value" as opposed to "fair market value" for facilities temporarily taken by the State.  Co-generation facilities are not exempt from the bill. 

CMTA is opposed and the bill may not move.  It is rumored that a Legislative Counsel opinion questions its constitutionality. The bill is currently in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee. 
  

ELECTRICAL GENERATION - STRICT LIABILITY 

ABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno) provides that a resale or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility that reduces or discontinues service for solely economic reasons shall be held strictly liable for any damages proximately caused by that reduction or discontinuance.  "Economic reasons" is defined as the withholding of power for financial gain. Cogeneration is exempted from the bill. 

CMTA is opposed.  According to the author's staff, the measure will not be moved. The bill is in Assembly EC&A Committee. 
  

ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS - ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES 

Despite rigorous debate on the Assembly Floor, on September 4 the Assembly adopted amendments to ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) which make the bill less onerous.  As amended, the measure makes it a wobbler for any person or entity, whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity, to exercise market power.  Market power is defined as the profitable maintenance of wholesale electricity prices above the prices that would occur in the wholesale market if that market were competitive.  The measure also allows the imposition of a fine of up to 10 percent of the violator's gross assets, upon conviction.  Felony penalties would apply to any person or entity that exercised market power during a Stage 1, 2 or 3 electrical emergency as determined by the Independent System Operator. 

The September 4 amendments limit the bill to apply only to entities whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity that are able to exercise market power, and technically exempt qualifying facilities, co-generation, or self-generation.  The measure still includes onerous bounty-hunter provisions that authorize the Attorney General to pay a reward to any person who provides information that materially contributes to the imposition of a criminal fine.  The reward would be equal to 10% of the amount of the criminal fine collected by the AG, district attorney, or imposed by the court.  The measure likely will be taken up for a vote on the Assembly Floor sometime this week. 
  

TAX - TRIAL DE NOVO 

AB 934 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys).  CMTA supports reforms to the property tax assessment appeal process, granting courts more power to overturn decisions that are anti-taxpayer. Assessors and counties claim that they will be manipulated into settling disputes too cheaply.  They obtained a Leg Counsel opinion declaring it to violate the California Constitution. 

The bill is in Senate Rules.  CMTA is lobbying to ensure that it is sent to Appropriations and are lobbying members of that committee as well as members whose votes will be needed on the floor.  There is speculation that it is being held in Rules for leverage for a larger deal but it is more probable that it is a tactic to delay it until Hertzberg, the author, is no longer Speaker. 
  

CORPORATE COUNSEL - PROTECTIVE ORDER/CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS 

AB 36 (Steinberg D-Sacramento), SB 11 (Escutia D-Whittier), AB 881 (Simitian D-Palo Alto).  CMTA opposes these bills to potentially expose proprietary information to the public.  SB 11 and AB 36 drive up litigation costs for defendants, leveraging higher settlements. AB 36 was "Speakerized" with the proviso that its substance would not go to the Governor, that SB 11 would be "the vehicle" and be revised into a more business friendly version.  Nevertheless, AB 36 (unchanged) has received a rule waiver allowing it to move in the Senate. 

CMTA is working on keeping the moderate Democrats in the Assembly from passing SB 11 and, if AB 36 does go to the Governor, in having them help with obtaining a veto.  CMTA is proposing AB 881 as an alternative though it is preferred that it not pass, and the trial lawyers would likely kill it.  At this point it appears that the moderates will stay with us but it appeared that way just before they caved-in in June. 
  

EDUCATION - CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 

AB 348 (Wright D-So. Central Los Angeles).  Several "voc-ed" bills designed to bolster this ailing system were passed by the Legislature this year including AB 348 which introduces mechanisms to elevate the academic standing of such courses.  Unfortunately, much of the funding for the voc-ed bills was cut out of the Budget. 
  

EDUCATION - FACILITIES BOND 

AB 16 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys/Leonard R-San Bernardino) and SB 844 (Chesbro D-Arcata).  CMTA has declared support for this legislation to place a statewide school facilities bond on the ballot in 2002. Their scope spans K-College.  A conference committee is addressing the timing for the ballot (March vs. November), the amount and the allocation between K-12 and higher ed., and the allocation system to use among schools. 
  

HOUSING 

CMTA supports two bills: AB 1284 (Lowenthal D-Long Beach) which provides property tax rewards to local jurisdictions within specified job centers (basically all of the major urban areas) which approve and build housing affordable to the local workforce.  SB 910 (Dunn D-Santa Ana) would impose sanctions on local jurisdictions which chronically fail to plan for their housing needs.  Both bills are in their second houses but are two-year projects.  Their terms will be negotiated during the interim. 
  

$3.6 BILLION WORKERS' COMPENSATION BILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK 

The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers' compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers $3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a negotiating mood. 

There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a $1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB 71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers' costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or someone else. 

Steve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the governor's point person on workers' compensation said, "the governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is comfortable with."  Smith dismissed the threat of labor turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else. 

Now that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at <http://www.cmta.net/press/082301work_comp.shtml> 
  

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 

SB 40 (Alarcon D-Sylmar) would increase unemployment insurance (UI) cost by over $3 billion over four years and includes several other onerous changes for employers.  The bill is in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on the suspense file and is opposed by CMTA. 

Unlike workers' compensation, UI has only two active parties of interest, labor and employers.  CMTA believes that employers are more vulnerable to a benefit increase in UI than workers' compensation because our maximum benefit level is the second lowest of all the states.  Therefore, employer representatives from CMTA, Cal-Chamber, Cal-Tax and Newspaper Publishers Association met with the author and labor to discuss a benefit increase and reforms to help offset some costs. The coalition has put together a proposal to counter SB 40. 

CMTA does not believe that the Governor would sign two benefit bills in the same year unless they were both negotiated and agreed upon by both labor and management.  According to the latest news, the Governor asked labor to choose and labor decided on the workers' compensation bill this session.  Therefore, no further action on UI will be taken this session. 
  

STORMWATER 

SB 72's author, Senator Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), and the bill sponsor, Santa-Monica-based Heal The Bay, agreed to remove all of the controversial minimum stormwater monitoring requirements affecting industrial facilities.  Most notably, the August 21 version deletes the proposed increase in stormwater sampling frequency and language requiring inclusion of additional constituents in each sampling event.  The current version also deletes all references to group monitoring - a regulatory program designed to streamline monitoring requirements for similar industrial facilities - which was originally prohibited.  These changes will spare individual facilities from thousands of dollars in increased stormwater monitoring costs.  All opposition has been removed, and the amendments lower the state's anticipated costs substantially.  The next hurdle is the state water board's renewal of the General Industrial Stormwater Permit next year. 
  

SAFE DRINKING WATER & TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT 

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65), SB 471 (Sher), was amended on July 5 to incorporate language developed by the Attorney General's office.  It is intended to help curb frivolous litigation, invited by lucrative bounty hunter provisions, that has overwhelmed the AG's resources.  Although advertised as a pro-business reform measure, the AG's proposal undermined the certainty of Prop. 65 settlements by allowing a district attorney, city attorney or private prosecutor to sue again for the same alleged offense.  The AG and Senator Sher have since agreed to remove that provision and make other lesser changes to avoid opposition from the business community.  The bill requires a 2/3 vote, which may not be achievable without a commitment from the AG to pursue further discussions toward more substantive reform. 
  

2002 PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FORECAST 

Water Quality Standards - SB 469 (Alpert D-Coronado).  Held up in end of session politics, the bill advances consensus recommendations to improve regional implementation of federal Total Maximum Daily Load program.  Requires state water board to develop guidelines for regional boards on listing and de-listing water bodies and implementing TMDLs.  Would help focus state resources on legitimate water quality problems.  May move as urgency legislation in January, 2002. 

Wastewater Discharge Offset Program - SB 815 (Machado D-Linden). Two-year vehicle to address the affects of legacy sources of pollution (e.g., abandoned mines) without bankrupting the discharger community.  Would provide less costly alternatives to end-of-the pipe permit limits, such as investing in upstream cleanup projects, with greater environmental benefits. 

Environmental Justice.  Under pressure from environmental activists, CARB is pursuing an aggressive agenda that does not track legislative direction.  Staff will present draft guidelines to the Board in December.  CARB's work will serve as a model for other Cal-EPA agencies required by SB 115 (Solis, 1999) and SB 89 (Escutia, 2000) to review their programs to address environmental justice concerns. 

Toxic Injuries - SB 693 (Scott D-Altadena).  Two-year measure sponsored by trial lawyers to extend the statute of limitations for filing injury claims related to hazardous material exposures.  Anticipate an oppose position. 

Brownfields Cleanup Incentives - AB 1114 (Pescetti).  Stalled this year due to politics surrounding Senator Escutia's local agency enforcement-based program in SB 32.  AB 1114 seeks flexible, risk-based cleanup standards, innocent operator liability relief and modest financial incentives for parties seeking to voluntarily initiate cleanup and redevelopment.

Sorry.  Haven't been around.  I definitely want to move forward.  I'll respond more fully if more is needed, but the short of it is, I'd like to do the entire job except for the decking.  Ready to start when you are.  Can you tell me what you expect the total to be (labor + materials), understanding that it's an estimate and not a firm price.  Also, I'm assuming that the cost for the materials that you quoted include the "bridge" to the cabin?  Will, of course, want the bridge to the cabin planked.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Really appreciate your efforts.  Looking forward to getting started.  Hope all finds you well.

Related Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at
Enron

By Stephen Taub

The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a
prepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." 

Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC
filings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. 

As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall
Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses. 


REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED
Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial
Times. 

Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues
climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. 

The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of
its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the
first half of this year. 

"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley told
the FT. 

Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through August 31. 

Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local
currency terms, according to the paper. 

Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt
covenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.

Mike:  Does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago(?) that gives the Governor the power to appoint the PUC president also give the Senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president?  I don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure would be interesting if it does.  Thanks.

Mike Day believes that SCE might agree to a new Stipulation in which they commit to pay our claim if their new deal and their pending Advice Letter are approved by the CPUC.  I have scheduled a call for tomorrow at 12:30 CST to discuss the terms we would like to see in the Stipulation (e.g., drop approval of the Advice Letter as a condition, payment within 10 days after CPUC approval, agreement on the number set forth in our response to their Data Request, agreement to apply accrued negative CTC credits to current T&D charges, to name a few).   On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting Summary
Importance:	High

Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can "heal its wounds." 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:

Alan Comnes


The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Subject: DA Suspended, but NOT retroactively


The Commission has just voted 3-2 to approve the draft ALJ Barnett decision=
, modified to be prospective only.  There is NO retroactive suspension.
=20

Carl Wood introduced the ALJ's draft decision, with a diatribe against dire=
ct access.  He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to =
large customers and an example of the saying that, "big dogs eat first and =
big dogs eat best."  He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens=
ion and no retroactivity.  He said he "finds it hard to consider these comm=
ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous."  He added that, "Smal=
l consumers effectively have no options."  He said retroactivity will be th=
e subject of further review, although it was not clear what this meant.  Wi=
thin 14 days, the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t=
o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 9/20/01.  He said that dire=
ct access is half of the failed deregulation process; the other half was op=
ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market.  He said that supporter=
s of DA engage in "hollow rhetoric."  The market has failed in the state, a=
nd, "We need to put an end to the lack of social responsibility in the elec=
tric market."

He concluded that several commenters had indicated that direct access was a=
 way for making green power available to residential customers.  He respond=
ed that this just means other customers are getting more dirty coal-fired p=
ower.  He concluded that advocates of direct access make a "fraudulent clai=
m of customer choice."=20

Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate, responding to Wood.  He sa=
id he had learned how to count, and he can count to three.  He then briefly=
 summarized his alternate.  First, he expressed disappointment in the Sacra=
mento process and the fact that they had not yet done something to rescue d=
irect access.  Second, he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from=
 that of other people.  He said he had always opposed the AB 1890 provision=
 that instituted the UDC buy-sell arrangement, saying that it eliminated th=
e largest customers from direct access.  Commissioner Duque then spoke brie=
fly to indicate his support for the Bilas alternate draft decision and his =
strong support for direct access.=20

Commissioner Brown said first, "In the weight of these sad times we must ob=
ey.  We are paying the price of the severe energy crisis which occurred las=
t year and the extraordinary means that were used to resolve it."  In an or=
dinary market, he thinks DA is good, but there is no way it can coexist wit=
h the State's $22 billion worth of bonds.  Therefore, there is no question =
that it has to be suspended.  "We probably should have done so months ago, =
in order to avoid a last-minute stampede."  There is an inequity between cu=
stomers that have moved to opt for direct access and those who have not.  B=
ut sometimes "you don't have a lot of good choices, and this is one of thos=
e times."  "If future legislation comes forward, and we hope that it would,=
" the Commission will attempt to revise this action.  =20

President Lynch noted the State Senate leadership has written asking for a =
study to be delivered by 1/1/02 as to how DA can be maintained without bias=
 to ratepayers and she supported this action.=20

Bilas and Duque indicated they will both file dissents.=20

In conclusion, we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac=
cess suspension.  We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su=
spension itself, on legal/procedural grounds.

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

regards,

Given that 1) the PUC has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 2) the PUC meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time, we'll reschedule our 11:30 AM PDT call to 3 PM PDT for today only.  

With the Legislature adjourned (thankfully), we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks.  The potential for a 3rd extraordinary session may affect what we do.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call.

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.

Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

Subject:	Draft Bond Legislation Language

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

Scott

fyi.

Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

Greetings Severin:

No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).  

However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.  I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.  

Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.

She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.

Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.

On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good.  You and Sweeney did a great job.  What was your impression?  I've noticed that it got some decent press.

Best,
Jeff

Snorkel?  I'm not sure I understand the reference. 
Naturally, my mind leaps readily to the vulgar and
prurient:  I could guess that one would use such a
device if one were kissing ass so deeply that one
would suffocate without a piped-in air supply
(crikey!), but then, having a snorkel in one's mouth
would render one unable to kiss effectively--ass or
otherwise--thereby defeating the purpose of said
object.  Just--a--hold your breath, shut your eyes and
pucker up, I always say.  With practice, one should
get along fine without additional devices.

heh heh, sheesh.

Thanks for the warning, though, as I will undoubtedly
have a hangover Saturday morning resulting from our
company Xmas party on the preceding evening.
  
I too am coming down with a cold, so next week will be
okay with me, but is Monday night free?  I have Bach's
Christmas Oratorio with the Symphony all the rest of
the week.  If you and Prentice are interested, I might
be able to get you tickets.

Greetings Ms Denne:
Hope your holiday was restful and relaxing.  A week or so ago, there was an article in the clips about Enron partnering with a muni (in Canada maybe) to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers.  Could someone in your shop try to dig that up?  I need to get it to a CEO of a California muni for EES and I'll be darned if I can't locate it!  Greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Jim, Jeff, and Tim,
I hope all is well.  I often wish I were on the
Portland trading floor in that gov't affairs job but
that's history and my family is here in DC where they
correctly thought they belonged.  I'm writing because
I just interviewed to be Pat Wood's technical advisor,
one of FERC's top positions, and wanted to alert you
that I mentioned you and your group as a reference.  I
hope that is ok; in my view we parted on good terms. 
He gave me the impression that I am very much in the
running.  I don't know if Enron people are applying
and don't want to compete with them.  But I think I'm
generally on the same page with you on policy issues
and I expect you would favor having more familiarity
with markets and market-oriented policies on staff
there.  Given your companies longstanding relationship
with Wood I thought you might be consulted on this. 
If so, I am asking for your support.
Thanks!
Rob Gramlich

Thanks for the reply.  Agree the settlement is not nearly all that it could have been, but sure beats what we've got, it seems. If there's something you think that we can do to help in the GCIM case, please let me know.

We went into the FERC proceeding believing that the Chief ALJ was not
likely to give us a good decision.  During the course of the proceeding, we
convinced ourselves that he would rule our way due to the vast evidence in
our favor and the relatively inept presentation of El Paso and El Paso
Merchant Energy.  Well, despite the voluminous record in support of our
position, the judge ruled that it was "not at all clear" that El Paso
exercised market power.  The good news for your affiliates is that, if the
Commission does not find the exercise of market power in this case, it
never will.  We hope when the Commission reviews the entire record,
including the "protected material", they will change the ALJ's finding.  On
some level we believe that the ALJ just does not like California.  He is
the judge, after all, who told Harold Ray in the electric generation
settlement discussions that he was "an asshole".  The ironic part of the
decision is that we felt that a determination by the ALJ that defined the
market in such a way as to preclude EPME having market power would be
difficult to overcome at the Commission level.  Instead, he defined the
market as we suggested and found that El Paso had market power; he simply
failed to be convinced that they were withholding capacity despite the fact
that they utilized their capacity 54% of the time when everyone else was
utilizing their own capacity at a capacity factor of between 85% and 90%.
Go figure.

I am still less than enchanted with the NGS settlement  after SoCalGas
tailored it to their interests but am glad that the Commission is at least
considering opening up the system ala PG&E.   I think that they are
reasonably aware that SoCalGas was not blameless in the runup in gas prices
that took place last December.   Having said that we are having a hell of a
time in the GCIM simply trying to investigate what really happened.
SoCalGas latest excuse for not giving us info is that we will "competitors"
with them (as a result of the filed rate litigation) for gas hedges.  I
must have misunderstood; I did not realize there was a limited supply of
hedges available and that there was competition for those "available"
hedges.   Anytime Enron wants to help on these GCIM issues, we would
welcome it--might make you look less like a Texas robber baron.

Hi Doug:
Hope all is well.  Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with
the PUC.  Must be a relief.

 I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the
El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change
it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?
Appreciate your insights.

AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed
decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!
What next?

Best,
Jeff

Much happened yesterday--wow!--and at least for now, it appears that Loretta has let the Legislature off the hook--appears that the PUC is still a fairly potent institution.
But it also appears that what had been (a foreseeable and avoidable) energy crisis, is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in Sacramento, so I don't think that legislators, irrespective of their wishes, can avoid staying involved.
Add 18XX to the mix and the signing/veto process generally, and, well, Sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant.
As such, we will have our regularly scheduled call tomorrow at 11:30.

Best,
Jeff

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
*****************************************************************
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Greetings:
Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing something, or don't have this right, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Two things.  1) Assuming that you're lead on the meeting (i.e., agenda, facilitate meeting)---if not, just let us know and we'll take the reins.  2) Seems appropriate to invite Jim to participate.  Sure he'll be interested.  Your call.

Hi Jane:

I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Best,
Jeff

I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

Mike Day's firm could do it, but they'll charge for the adminstrative costs necessary to file (we don't have the support necessary to file).  Does that work?  If so, I'll need to contact Mike promptly so they can get prepared to do the filing.  No word yet as to whether SoCalGas will support.

Two questions.  Any word as to whether or not SoCal has taken a definite position?  Secondly, assuming Transwestern files its own comments in support of the PD, could you help us make the filing?  Greg Porter, our attorney is drafting the comments today however we may not have it ready until tomorrow.  Thanks.

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

In California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.  Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.  There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

No problem.  Thanks for the response.  I understand the need to keep powder dry.  Talked to Hertzberg this morning.  The 3rd extraordinary ain't sounding like it's going to be a winner.  Hope to talk soon.
 
Best,
Jeff

Greetings Eve and Bill:
This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a)m aintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.  We hope that you can join.
 
All the best,
Jeff

Subject: Draft Application for Rehearing


Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtoodw eekend!

Hi Glen:
Two things.  1) If you'd like me to join in on the call on Wednesday to determine what TW should do regarding the re-surfacing of the SoCal settlement, I'd be happy to join.  Just let me know.  2) Are you going to the SoCal "no more windows" meeting on Thursday?  I'd planned to go but it looks like I might have a conflict now.  I'd like to get a copy of anything they hand out at the meeting.  And if anyone provides any summaries, that would also be useful.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  If you don't, know sweat.

Best,
Jeff

Apologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion, but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with Bill and Aaron.  Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?

Best,
Jeff

All,

Unfortunately, Aaron and I will not be able to make this call.  However, we
wanted to let the group know that we are strongly opposed to New West's
proposal and urge the group to adopt the position we agreed to during last
week's call, i.e., oppose the UDCs' proposal for a DASR cut-off date, for
the reasons outlined in Dan's most recent draft.

Thanks.

I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.  
 <<arm-puc-plan.doc>> 
Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for review
and validation

Jeff, 

In what time frame are these decisions looking at being made?  keep me posted on the July 1st roll back since it would have the biggest implications for EWS/EES existing positions.

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch. 
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers. 
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1. 
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter. 
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Subject: IMPORTANT ! : Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E)=
 for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or=
der Shortening Time


Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos=
t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c=
omments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motio=
n, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec=
ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for=
 SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which me=
ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Satur=
day).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:


  _____ =20

"Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t=
o which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of=
 direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there =
is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce=
ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of =
an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to=
 San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi=
tments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate dir=
ect access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E disc=
usses below how to provide for this coordination.=20

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections wi=
ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That =
stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access=
 and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct =
access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the=
 summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direc=
t access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly hal=
f. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a=
 result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avo=
id paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspe=
nd direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, th=
e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, a=
nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effe=
ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause larg=
e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly.=20

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce=
ss and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an=
 open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect=
ions take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided inf=
ormation on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggrega=
tion) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment =
period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is schedul=
ed to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitmen=
ts to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller cu=
stomers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the =
use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the informatio=
n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of =
over- or under-commitment.=20

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of se=
rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, a=
nd, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce=
ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to l=
imit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a=
n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai=
ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c=
ustomers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commo=
dity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access=
 prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing,=
 again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
=20
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-t=
erm period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan."

  _____ =20


The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____ =20

"When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take=
 advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although C=
alifornia's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is stil=
l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul=
atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states hav=
e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short req=
uirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auct=
ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. Ca=

I agree.  Sue, I'm willing to join Mike in a meeting with Bilas. Mike, can you set up a meeting for Wednesday morning?  Sue: Can you meet with Brown/Gamson? Others have thoughts about these meetings?

PS  Boeing's lobbyist told Katz today (Davis' point person on 78)that the date must be September 1, period.  Katz told the Boeing lobbyist that the August 25th date is there to "screw Enron." Hedy has confirmed that Raytheon is also working the date issue.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: FW: A.00-11-038 et al. RSP - SCE's Notice of Scheduled
Individual Ex Parte Communication Meeting



As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

Subject:	Intention to Challenge the California's PUC's Decision to Suspend DA

?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Avram.  Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  Rory and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.  Avram, could you explain one more time to Rory exactly what it is that you're looking for, just to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?  Rory has some ideas.

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,

If these guys are manipulating the market they certainly aren't doing a
very good job of it.  Can't you send some folks over to give them a few

As things change, so do call schedules.  We conferred and have recommend that:

There will not be a call this week.
Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.

If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know.

Best,
Jeff

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

You might add the following:

Utility Processing Risk  -  will the utilities try to reject contracts that
are pre-Sept 20 but which are DASR'd afterwards for one reason or another,
or will the utilities try to impose other restrictive requirements to limit
the number of post July 1 contracts they must switch to DA?

Confidentiality Issues _ As part of their policing responsibility on this
issue, the utilities will likely try to insist on seeing all post July 1 DA
contracts, including sensitive provisions, and we will have to resist giving
sensitive commercial information.

Subject: meeting with Enron


Jeff,

It was great to talk to you today.  Thank you so much for taking the time to
hear about our latest developments.  As I said earlier, we are very
interested in talking to your folks in the Net Works group at Enron.  The
pilot we are implementing for the Enron Energy Services group is going
extremely well.  We've been on site now for about two weeks and have pretty
much completed our user training sessions.  Everyone at Enron is very
pleased with the success of the project so far.  

I think the best thing would be to schedule a meeting for sometime in
mid-October.  That way, the Pilot Program will be completely implemented and
we will have more feedback on the use of our application.  How about the
week of October 15th?  Anytime that week will work with us and, as I told
you earlier, we are in Houston very frequently.

The people who would be a part of the discussion would be Ian Sullivan (who
heads up all implementation and professional services) and myself.

If anyone would like more information about Perfect Commerce prior to the
meeting I would be more than happy to send that over.  Just let me know.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Cameron

Attached for your review and comment is a revised draft of the application for rehearing to be filed on Friday the 28th. There are two primary changes. The California Chamber of Commerce has been added to the application and an argument has been added that the Decision contradicts the most recent legislative intent expressed in ABX2 9 that direct access continue, at least for aggregation and community choice purposes. 
Any and all comments will be very much appreciated. Also, I would appreciate it if Sue Mara would forward the document to her contact at the Chamber so that they can also review the draft. Thanks!

Greetings Ms J:

Could you do me a favor and call harold jenson (sp?) in EES and see what he's looking for?  He's apparently looking for deregulation info about CA.  Greatly indebted, as always.

Unfortunately, I'm not likely to get to the CERA conference.

We are not giving any more money in California.  To that end we just sent a letter to the D's saying, essentially, "we're giving the money we thought we were going to give you to the N.Y. Disaster Relief fund."   Prior to the "no more money" decision, we also concluded that it made no sense to give individual donations.  So ... the following should a letter similar to the following should work:    

"Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in your October 24 reception.  Earlier this year, we made a corporate decision to direct our campaign dollars in California to the California Republican Party and not participate in individual races."

I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?

State discloses spot power  buys

By Andrew  LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER  


SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  

The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  

Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  

Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  

The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  

In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

FYI.  Angelides is trying to turn the screws on Loretta.
*********************************************************************
Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter
 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.

deepthroat is rather provocative, don't you think?

Hey, whatever you're doing, keep it up!  I don't know how you moved the stock from 24 to 37, and I don't care.  Keep it up!

Subject:	Conversation w/Jerry Hirsch of LA Times

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date.
The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back.
California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL>
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.

Jeff

Legislative Weekly 
October 15, 2001 
Issue 40, Volume 3 

A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento

ECONOMIC SUMMIT 

In the wake of repeated economic blows on the state's business community and announcements of losses, layoffs and declining tax revenues, the Governor has stated his intention to hold an Economic Summit in early November with business and labor leaders, and professional economists to identify and discuss measures to stimulate California's economy.   The date and participants will be announced this week.  Governor Davis is also considering the possibility of calling a Special Legislative Session to enact such measures immediately.   In an effort to avoid or minimize a looming State budget deficit, the Department of Finance has instructed state agencies to cut their budgets by 15%. 

CMTA's members are devising a priority list of policies that should be adopted to help mitigate the effects of the international economic cooling and hopefully, stave-off recession in this state. 

POWER AUTHORITY MEETING 

Renewables and the Power Authority 
At an October 5 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) meeting in San Francisco, Chairman David Freeman acknowledged that renewable peaking capacity may comprise a significant portion of the 15 percent reserve the Authority expects to establish to prevent future price spikes in the cost of electricity. 

Freeman indicated that the Authority has received proposals for 18,000 MW in peaker capacity, which have been evaluated and winnowed down to 3,000 MW.  While commitments to build these peaker facilities have not yet been formalized, the Power Authority is moving forward with proposals for a few hundred renewable megawatts. 

Freeman also indicated that at least two state biomass plants are at risk of shutting down.  He believes that these plants should continue to run, despite the high costs associated with this market.  Power Authority staff has been asked to look at options to keep the plants operating, and to report back to the Power Authority. 

Board member Donald Vial expressed concern at the way in which the Power Authority is looking at the 15 percent reserve.  He believes that the reserve should be a working capacity margin used to phase out dirty plants and to move into, and to promote renewables. 

Board member John Stevens pointed out that the Power Authority has limited funding with which to purchase peaking capacity, and reminded the members that any plan must reasonably balance the costs associated with the generation capacity. 

Department of Water Resources Update 
The Power Authority also received a report from staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR) who indicated that the Department is looking at load curtailment, renewables and new supplies that ideally are north of Path 15.  The Department believes it has been instrumental in keeping the spot market under control and minimizing the number of blackouts experienced this summer.  The Department also gave a great deal of credit to customers who have been instrumental in preventing blackouts through conservation. 

The Department will be updating its energy portfolio needs, and posting its information on its website at www.cers.water.ca.gov, sometime next week. 

Public Utilities Commission Natural Gas Infrastructure Report 
Barbara Hale, the Director of Strategic Planning at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) provided an update on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report that is due to the Power Authority by November 15.  Ms. Hale indicated that the PUC is working with the California Energy Commission (CEC) to evaluate the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure, including interstate pipelines, intrastate pipelines, local distribution, storage and backbone.  The PUC fully expects to have the report finalized and ready to deliver to the Power Authority by November 15. 

Preliminary findings indicate that in-ground storage is at 85 percent of capacity, a healthy margin to meet demands through the winter.  While there still is room to inject additional natural gas, the PUC is expecting a moderate winter with low gas demand. 
Chairman Freeman requested that the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report also include a forecast of natural gas availability from the lower 48 states and Canada, as well as whether or not California may depend on these sources to meet its needs. 

Board Member Vial questioned if the unbundling of storage has been successful.  Ms. Hale replied that the PUC is monitoring non-core use, and that preliminary findings indicate that many non-core customers are increasing their use of storage. 

Activities Related to Renewable Energy and Conservation 
Staff at the Power Authority reported that coordination between the PUC and the Power Authority is necessary to optimize conservation, energy efficiency, and demand response.  Specifically, the Power Authority is putting together a residential loan program; financing for efficiencies in public buildings; and, financing for small commercial and industrial upgrades.  The Power Authority believes that the small commercial and industrial market is the most under-served, due to the multiple demands on owners and their lack of resources.  The Power Authority is looking at ways to assist these customers in retrofitting their facilities. 

At the other end of the spectrum, the Power Authority believes that large commercial and industrial customers require the least assistance.  The Power Authority believes these customers are well served under current programs, but acknowledged that many of the demand response programs would be better coordinated under the administration of just one agency. 

Finally, Board Member Vial questioned why there has been little emphasis on real time pricing.  Power Authority staff agreed that real time pricing has not been a priority, and that the infrastructure to implement a real time pricing program does not currently exist.  Staff did indicate, however, that a recent $35 million investment in meters should help to incentivize these programs. 

Freeman concluded that it is important for the Power Authority to build on the momentum of conservation, and he acknowledged that technology finally is being priced such that real time pricing makes sense and likely will be an integral part of the Power Authority's program. 

Laura Doll Named as New Executive Director 
Laura Doll of Austin, Texas was approved as the Chief Executive Officer of the Power Authority at the October 5 Board meeting.  Most recently, Doll was Director of Customer Service for Grande Communications.  She also has held the positions of Senior Vice President for Planergy, as well as Chief Administrative Officer for Austin Energy.  Doll received a master of public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin, and a bachelor of arts degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  She will receive an annual salary of $200,000. 

COMPUTER RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY BILL VETOED (AGAIN) 

Governor Davis vetoed SB 147 by Senator Debra Bowen (D-Marina Del Rey) on October 8.  The bill would have required employers to prepare and distribute by hard copy or electronically, a company monitoring policies and practices notice to each employee, to collect and verify their understanding of the notice, and file and maintain each employee's signed notice indefinitely.  This is the third time Senator Bowen's notice bill has been vetoed by the Governor and we hope that the bill has struck out. 

In his veto message, the governor referred to some of the concerns expressed by employers such as the need to monitor and control the use of company property for business purposes.  Also employers are potentially liable for the misuse of computers for improper purposes, such as sexual harassment, defamation and the like, so employers have a legitimate reason to monitor e-mail and computer files from time to time. 

The Governor said in closing his veto message, " I support reasonable privacy protections for employees in the workplace and my Administration proposed amendments which would carry out the intent of the bill without imposing undue regulatory burdens and potential legal exposure to businesses for doing what any employee should assume is the employer's right when they accept employment.  Senator Bowen rejected the proposed amendments. Thus, I must veto the bill a third time." 

This is a significant victory for employers.  The bill had the potential to open up Pandora's box on employee notices in the workplace by greatly expanding the scope, confirmation and tracking of notices.  CMTA applauds the Governor's veto of SB 147. 

GOVERNOR SIGNS MERCURY LEGISLATION 

Governor Davis has signed legislation to place new controls on products containing mercury.  SB 633 by Senator Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) places new controls on the disposal of appliance and vehicle components found to contain mercury. 

"I am signing this bill because it will help reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded thermometers, novelty products, and by mercury-containing electrical switches that are not removed before junked vehicles are crushed or shredded," said Davis. 

SB 633 also bans the sale of new automobiles in California after January 1, 2005 that contain mercury electrical switches. 
  

LATE BREAKING NEWS: 

SB 71 (Burton D-San Francisco), Workers' Compensation, vetoed by the Governor.

If you're referring to the Tues/Thur call, we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with Sacramento folks having the option of callling in, since the Legislature's gone until January. You have thoughts on the Monday call?  That one may not be as critical anymore.

Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?

This is the same cap that applies to SoCal.P.46

4)Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a delivery/receipt at Ferc.

capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF. P.52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service.P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore

Maybe you could send an email to them now explaining when the pilot is
supposed to finish and that it might be better to schedule after that
date.
That way you are also bringing us up and having them think about us
again.
Pure psychology.

I think PP really liked the cooking class.  She looked cute in the apron

babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you
ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with
execs may not have occured yet.  nevertheless, you'll have a darned good
idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?

anywho, let's see what response i get back.  maybe they'll want to push
back.

her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place
previously).  now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even
more gorgeous (if that's possible).

best,
Jeff

OK, so the oct 15th date is a little too early.  The pilot review with
execs
at enron is at the end of the month.  SO, we should target early
November
for this meeting.  Can you help facilitate that?

What did you think of PP's hair.  I was shocked.  It looked really good!

We are tentatively scheduled for a Pilot Review with the VP of EES on
10/30
in Houston, so early Nov. for this meeting is probably the best bet.

I pushed this date way out.  We can easily push it out more. Jeff fully
understands that we want to schedule this meeting after the pilot has
been
completed (not get in the way, see the real value of the system
first...etc.).  My question to you is when is the pilot scheduled to be
completed so I have a time frame on when these discussions might take
place.

Thanks,

Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project-we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES-acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time-the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Jeff

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting.
However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively.
As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC.

We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them.

Best,
Jeff

Sarah,
 
Nice chatting with you. As I mentioned we are looking for an assistant analyst to work in the communications software and wireless area. 
 
My current coverage list includes Openwave, Palm, RIMM, Handspring, Comverse, Aether, Nuance, SpeechWorks, etc. Given the way our business is growing and evolving, we will be moving towards names like Qualcomm, Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson in the very near future. We are looking for all of the clich? characteristics: motivated, high level of initiative, self disciplined, high attention to detail, good writing skills, modeling experience, blah, blah, blah. Potential assistants should expect to take primary responsibility for coverage on lower capitalization companies ASAP and migrate upwards as market conditions improve and research coverage is broadened (within a few months). The position would be based in Portland, OR.
 
Pacific Crest is a full service investment bank focused on the Internet and communications technology companies. The Bank has approximately 100 professionals with primary offices in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest also has offices in Seattle, San Francisco (primarily IB operations), and Boston (Sales and Trading). Most of the professionals at the Bank come from a larger institutions. Before joining Pacific Crest, I was an analyst at Deutsche Bank in London and ING Barings in Latin America. 
 
If you have any other questions please feel free to give me a shout. I haven't been too specific on requirements as we are really just looking for the smartest and best people and are less concerned about previous experience, etc. It has been a fairly good hiring strategy to date-since I joined Pacific Crest, we have had zero attrition or turnover. 
 
Regards, James
 
P.S. If you are ever in town on a weekday, feel free to come by-we are at the top of the U.S. Bank Tower (big Pinky) and have the best view in Portland.

I love it.  Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.  If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., "Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for"), it would really bring the house down.  But I think that ENA would get damn queasy about doing it.

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Best,
Jeff

Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful or not?  Two things occur to me.  First, it is not becoming for a commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of industry -- particularly if you're a Democrat.  Second, it has always struck me that what she needs is some form of record support, not political pats on the back in one-page letters.  I am asking you these questions not judging the proposal to send a letter .... but I've never understood what they're supposed to do for her and I honestly would like to understand.

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:

1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."

Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.

Subject:	Intention to Challenge the California's PUC's Decision to Suspend DA

?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
Thanks for this and all of the prior updates.  Thanks als for the calls last week, or was it the week prior.  The last couple of weeks have been brutal.  Hopefully things get better from here.

I have been leaving the day to day management of the ees/iso situation in the capable hands of steve hall and jeff richter.  So far so good, although I hope that the ees sales team can get a deal done soon.

I'm taking the next couple of days off.  I'll call you towards the end of the week t catch up.  Sorry I've been so hard to reach.

I hope that you are hanging in there.

Tim

Probably no need to reiterate here (it just makes me feel better), but the =
date of the bill signing or September 1 is MUCH MUCH preferable to EES. We =
have substantial contracts that we executed at the end of August.

My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that).  About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state.  I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM.  So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11.  That work?

The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.

Hi Cynthia:

I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday, Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM (want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is where I always rent).  Is this something that you folks generally arrange, or do I just do it?  Is there a corporate account # I'll need if I do it?  Really appreciate your help.

Best,
Jeff

FYI, in case you haven't see this yet:

PLAYING AN 'UNUSUAL' ROLE, LANGDON PICKS THROUGH EL PASO RECORD
Handed the unusual task of independently assessing the strength of El Paso Corp.'s defense in the
California capacity complaint case, Washington attorney Jim Langdon for weeks has been searching for
relevant issues that may have been ignored or overlooked by the litigants. And he thinks he may have
stumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the
critical months of the California energy crisis.
What Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case (RP00-241), the California Public Utilities
Commission, may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during
the months of the controversial large-volume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co. and
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co.
Langdon, a partner in the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, in late July was
hired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the
record in the case (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The idea was "not to second-guess the lawyers litigating the case," but
rather to "think dispassionately about the events of last year" and give Wise "an independent view" of the
behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the 15-month contract for 1.22 Bcf/day of capacity to
California, Langdon explained last week.
Wise's decision to hire Langdon was eye-catching on a few levels. In his many years in law practice,
Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for, Langdon told
Inside FERC, acknowledging "this really was a little bit of an unusual request."
Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdon's substantial administration connec-tions.
He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon, who as
a FERC commissioner in the early 1990s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser.
Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition
and the possibility that he may have some positive, collateral impact on the commission's ultimate
decision in this case?
That possibility "didn't escape me" at the time, Langdon admitted. "I'll not pretend to be unaware
that there are these other connections with Wood and the president," he allowed, adding that "that's
something that impacts everything I do. But what can I do? I have to practice law." And, "for the
record, I barely know Pat Wood."
And how can this be considered an independent, third-party assessment if El Paso is paying for
Langdon's services? "I recognize that there are critics and cynics" who would suggest that Langdon is
simply a hired gun, "but at the end of the day, . . . I'll have to stand behind" the report. He vowed to
"call it the way I see it."
His final report to Wise won't be ready for several weeks, but Langdon shared some of his initial
thoughts and findings.
Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern
California Gas Co. storage facilities - the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County
and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County. During the period that roughly coincides with the El
Paso/El Paso Merchant contract, SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large
volumes of storage gas from those fields, said Langdon. The state commission finally granted the requests
in June 2001, the month after termination of the contract, he related.
Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso
Canyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100,000
Dt/day of deliverability to the California gas market "without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity,"
said Langdon. Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network, he stressed that
"storage is huge" in moderating the market. When pipeline capacity is constrained, "storage is a way to
take care of . . . these problems."
And yet, the SoCal Gas applications "clearly languished" at the CPUC. "There may be very good reasons"
why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas, but so far "I don't understand how the CPUC
sits on a storage application like that during this time period when it's as significant as it is."
For its part, the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state
border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its
feet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project (IF, 14 May, 5). "I'm trying not to sound like an
advocate in this thing," said Langdon, but "I don't understand the CPUC's position in the case, . . . when
right in their own back yard they've got these storage issues."
As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the
contract and subsequently "withheld massive amounts of capacity" from the market, "we've reached the
conclusion that we don't see that kind of evidence in what's been presented" so far in the proceeding, said
Langdon. His team of lawyers is looking closely at "the maze of engineering issues" that could hold the
answer to the capacity withholding issue.
Langdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations
colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving
energy market. Order 497, the marketing-affiliate rule, was first promulgated in 1986, he noted.
In most industries, such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace. But here, the
gas industry has "been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of, and yet these rules are the
very same ones" that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years. "They absolutely need to
be updated, end of sentence, end of paragraph," said Langdon.
Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. about
the strength of the El Paso case, Langdon said he was "not at all concerned about the company not
getting a fair shake" at the commission. Much of what Wagner had to say "has been sensationalized to
a degree" in the press, he said, adding that "what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are
two different things."
Langdon admitted that he would be "a little concerned" about Wagner's remarks "if I were litigating
the case." The judge has used some "pretty strong language" to suggest that the El Paso companies were
out of line. But FERC "historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal," and "in this case, the record
looks very sound," he said. - Chris Newkumet

Subject:        Commission Clarifies DA Suspension Decision--Requires Utilities to Accept DASRs for Facility Adds Under Contracts Signed Before 10.20.01

??????? In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."

??????? The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.

??????? Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.

??????? In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.

??????? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  

??????? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.

??????? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.

??????? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,

Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

Greetings Professor:
I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.  Few items:

--I assume that you returned papers.  I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.  Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).  Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.

--I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.

Thanks very much.

Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc.


Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons
to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the
bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as
follows:

   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be
   exempt from paying for the bonds.

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power
   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power
   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would
only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took
place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that
took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree
during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able
to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which
can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that
we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill
clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment
to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that
switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And
if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the
bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

Couple thoughts.  Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.

Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.
Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.
It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.
In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.
But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).
But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.

Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.

Best,
Jeff

FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO=20
Updated: Friday, September 21, 2001 04:53 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JON=
ES NEWSWIRES=20
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20
At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20
The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20
"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20
ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20
The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20
If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20
"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20
The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20
"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20
The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20
Generators Confused=20
Generators, including Mirant Corp. (MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investme=
nts/quotes/?symbol=3DMIR>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news=
/?symbol=3DMIR>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbo=

mbol=3DWMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DWMB=
>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DWMB>), Duk=
e Energy (DUK <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DDUK>,=
 news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDUK>, msgs <htt=
p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDUK>) and Dynegy Inc. =
(DYN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DDYN>, news <ht=
tp://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDYN>, msgs <http://quick=
en.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought apparently i=
nexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later that the=
 price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegations, the I=
SO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market"=
 purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=
articipants see.=20
DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20
The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20
None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20
The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20
The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20
"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE "DISPATCHABLE."

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?
PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.)  IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING.

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE.  HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED.

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

YES.

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED.

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST.  THEY ARE A MYTH.  THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE.

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

THAT'S A GOOD THING.  AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS.

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.  AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF.  LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a) maintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.  We hope that you can join.

Subject: Draft Application for Rehearing


Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue of retroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state and federal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtood weekend!

I took a quick look.  In short:
--create regulatory asset out of the PX credit

Seems like something IEP would certaintly be way out in front on. After suppliers' last experience with the PUC's planning process, seems like they'd aggressively go after its return in a very big way.

Subject: CPUC Initiating Rulemaking on "Integrated Resource Planning"
Importance: High


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
"retirement."

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to "integrated resource
planning."  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting
Importance: High


FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to "integrated resource planning"
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

Two things:  When Aleck said that he was leaving "effective immediately," does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?  If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?

Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.  His concerns are two-fold:  Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with. And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).  

I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're "staying under radar" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

One other thing.  I just had coffee with a former business colleague.  She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).  I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t. setting up board, staff, etc.  She's very interested. She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.  Are you interested in talking to her?

Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.

Subject: ML Power Group-EIX-Update Following Meeting With Management


* We met with Edison management on Friday (10/12) to discuss the recently
announced settlement agreement between the company and the CPUC.  The
agreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for
Edison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume
power procurement responsibilities.
* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be
recovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a
bridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.
* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides
apparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be
timing of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will
likely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas
prices.
* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated
settlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which
Edison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action
to recover alleged generator overcharges.
* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree
on the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially
release Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as
opposed to through the PX/ISO.
* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few
weeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.
* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether
or not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up
as a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility
retained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.
* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about
the earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are
sticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and
$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential
upside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are
restored under the terms of the settlement agreement.
* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average
multiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although
clarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst.

Hi Jane:

I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Best,
Jeff

THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED 
Governor Davis has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory. 
Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

It's more complicated still.  A crazy commissioner at the CPUC now wants to require everyone to submit their DA contracts to Commission for review.  It's attached.  Folks are going to oppose it very strongly.  I'm available to talk.  I'm not sure that the Oct. 5th date has got legs.

Guys please see the email from Hanson below.
 
Dave would like to talk about this tomorrow morning say 10:00 am PST, please let me know if you can't make it.  
 
Jeff, can you provide us with an update on items 1 and 2.
 
Harlan and Chris, obviously we will be focusing on Hanson's request for compensation for "delayed opportunity to participate in Direct Access".  I have also attached a time line of events surrounding this agreement and the DASR.

Subject: DASR / Contract Notification to CPUC



Dear Victor and David: 

Please review the CPUC attachments provided by CLECA's Dr. Barbara Barkovich. The CPUC is aggressively following up on Direct Access contracts and DASR's. Please let us know where you are in responding to the CPUC Direct Access Verification process as it relates to Hanson Permanente's contract with Enron, as follows:

1. Have you been contacted by the CPUC or PG&E related to the Direct Access verification process? 
2. What information have you provided to the CPUC and to any other requesting party? 

We look forward to hearing from you ASAP on answers to these questions.  We would also appreciate copies of any correspondence that you have had with anyone on the DASR and Direct Access Contract. 

The DASR process was handled very poorly by Enron in September, and those errors delayed Hanson Permanente's opportunity to participate in Direct Access until November. We are awaiting Enron's remedy to compensate Hanson for the added power cost incurred during October 2001.

Please call me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely, 

Earl

For those of you who have gone DA, did all of your ESPs send your names 
to the utilities by Oct. 5?  Here is the utility filing on DA suspension implementation and that is an important date.  I want to be sure that we don't have any problems along those lines.

I am including copies of the utility filings for those of you who want to learn more about this and why the date is important.  We need to file comments on the utility filings by Nov. 28. Barbara

SVMG ENERGY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, LIAISON REPRESENTATIVES & PRINCIPAL OFFICERS:

The California business community needs your help in opposing AB67 XX.  This
bill represents a dangerous attempt to rewrite SB78 XX, the Edison bail-out
legislation, which passed the Assembly last Friday.  After months of good
faith discussions the amendments the California Business Coalition so
strongly advocated for have been completely disregarded.  Direct Access
continues to be threatened and an unfair rate increase for large energy
users still lingers.

We urge you to contact your local delegation to express your opposition to
this inequitable legislation.  The Senate will be voting on SB67 XX
immediately.  If passed, the bill will go to the Assembly for vote tomorrow
morning.  Please contact members of both houses so that the concerns of the
California business community are clearly heard.

Attached please find the Business Coalitions floor alert, the SVMG's letter
opposing SB67 XX, as well as a spreadsheet with contact information for our
local legislative delegation.  Any effort in this regard will make a
difference.  Thank you for all of your help.

Sincerest Regards,

Carl Guardino

Michael Tribolet and I are scheduled to meet with Fielder on Monday, Oct 1. at 10 AM to test the waters for a possible settlement of our PX credit claim with Edison. If the Governor calls a special session to begin Oct 1, I'd guess that Edison will try to delay the meeting.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Cornerstone is a pretty good place.  I haven't had any dealings with them
for a few years, but I know a number of people who have worked with them
and all were pretty positive.

Hey Jeff
Yep there were a lot of people.  The class seems a lot
more like an undergrad class: lecture style, one small
book,  only one exam-in class final, no name tags, no
attendance monitoring. Lecture seems to VERY closely
mirror the book. While the logistics look favorable
from a time perspective, I'm not sure how promising it
looks from a "wow" that was a great class perspective.
  

Class held from 6:00 til 8:30 ish, w/ a 5 min break
(we voted).
Hope you're havin fun on vacation!  Let me know if
you're going to go to this class, or want to catch up
on Tues durng break-

Mike Day and I talked.  Mike agreed that there's "elbow room" in PUC regulations that would allow PG&E to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.  However, Mike also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.  In the end, PG&E will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PG&E's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.  In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds.  If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.

Jeff

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.

Jeff,
John White has proposed to the CEERT Board that we send the attached letter to the Governor attacking the DWR contracts. Would you please take a look at it and let me know what you think of it.  You can reach me on my cell phone at 213-359-0853. Thanks.

Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  Edison is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.  
 
Best,
Jeff

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ?

Don't hate me for sending a note.  What do you think?
"California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."
"Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."

Sweetie, what happened?  How'd you hurt your back?  So sorry.  And SO sorry that this isn't working out for anyone.  I really wanted to see you guys and REALLY wanted to ride.  Another day, I guess.  Take care of that back.  Herniated disks are bad, so take care.

Hey gang-
Just back from the doctors and he said "do not go riding this weekend".
I am terribly disappointed but it wouldn't be wise. I don't have any
broken bones and it doesn't appear that I have a herniated disk--at this
point just a lumbar strain but he is afraid it will get worse if I ride.
I am sorry for the inconvenience and I will send Lari a separate email.
I hope the trip is wonderful. Please share the details.

Hi all,

Sorry that some of you won't be making it to Mendocino.  I talked to
Lari's
assistant Cynthia and they are not planning to exact cancellation
charges.
Cal and I are still planning an all-day ride on Saturday, and Pat and
Nora
will be joining us on Sunday for a four-hour beach ride.  Would love for
any
of you who are "on the fence" to join us for both days.  The Ranch would
like to know by Wednesday if possible.

Hey guys--
It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly
affected in the tragedy.

I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
find out more this upcoming week and let you know.

If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for
so long, I am sad to think of not joining all of you.

I will get back to you by Wednesday.

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?


Amy

Jeff: Thanks again for joining for the conference. I was actually very busy with folks there through the breakfast meeting Saturday am (had one particularly hostile attendee to that) and then on through Saturday afternoon- questions, questions, questions so I would say our attendance was definitely worthwhile. Your insight and provacative discussion provided an excellent framework for the business case we were trying to communicate. If I can ever be of any assistance to you, please feel free to call me. When I meet folks like you, it just reinforces my commitment to the great people we work with and the great company we work for. Thanks, Laurie

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Or earlier, if you want. How does that sound? Let me know.

The best I've ever had in my whole entire life, anywhere in the world.

Seriously, I think the guests--including me--thought that it was fabulous. I know Prentice finished hers, so I assume she liked it.  Cameron......well, you'll have to ask her.

The mango chutney combined with the curry was, like, death raging, man.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

I spoke with Ken Smith about his work with Enron.  His monthly retainer ends the end of October, and he has agreed (very happily) to be available as needed going forward on an hourly basis ($160/hour).  To make it easiest, we have agreed that he can do up to five hours of work a month without any prior authorization from me -- this should make it as easy as possible for the entire team to be able to use him as needed.  If a project arises that will consume more time, he will contact me.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

This will work for what I need to submit.  FYI:  I'm not going to get another person to help out on this, so I'm assuming that with me and the resources that I'll bring to bear, and with you folks and the resources that you'll devote, we'll be able to do an outstanding job of achieving the overall objective of taking a proactive regulatory stance in California.

Best,
Jeff

Based upon the discussion in our last meeting, we would suggest the need for increased coverage of the following areas:

1. PG&E's Gas Accord 
2. PG&E's attempt to switch backbone jurisdiciton to FERC through the bankruptcy proceeding
3. Movement in Socal's GIR or other plans to open its backbone to firm transport
4. Socal's RLS tariff and requests to reduce the cost allocation to that service.
5. Socal WACOG filings, calculations
6. Tariff changes that provide for backhaul service from SDG&E/North Baja to Socal territory

Jeff - this is just a cursory list. Our real need is to have information that comes from a proactive stance in the regulatory processes.  

Please call  Barry or myself if you have any questions.

Regards,

Stephanie

no sense of humor.  amazing how almost a year of mud slinging reduces even the most chipper among us to an "just the facts mam, only the facts" type of guy.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.
