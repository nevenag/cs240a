 The Commission convert El Pasos Full Requirements service FR to Contract Demand service CD - Allocation of CD be based on the greater of 1 a shippers billing determinants from the 1996 settlement or 2 coincidental peak a shippers own usage based on demand on Sept 12 2001 - The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on El Pasos proposed 20 pooling point configuration - A technical conference be convened that may include attendance by the Commissioners on the Staff recommendations Background Staff recounted the issue on El Pasos system including the question to be decided by the Commission has El Pasos FR service become unjust and unreasonable  Staff believes it has and explains that it is within the Commissions jurisdiction to allocate El Pasos capacity in order to 1 restore system flexibility 2 end uncertainty in the form of pro rata capacity cuts of firm delivery 3 ensure full  fair utilization of El Pasos system According to Staffs presentation the problems on El Pasos system are due to changes in system load since the pipelines 1996 settlement  A major increase in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996 which was nearly one half unsold at that time has changed the operations and capacity availability on El Paso resulting in frequent capacity constraints on the system  This problem is aggravated by the settlements resultant rate freeze which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso to expand or upgrade its system Recommendations Bob Petrocelli presenting Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD while maintaining 1 the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement and 2 a small amount of FT-2 FR contracts for small customers such as municipalities with an overall cap on the rate schedule  This will balance the interests of all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system  Also it will send the proper price signals for system expansions In comments on this and related proceedings shippers have recommended four allocation methods for the converted CD 1 1996 settlement bid determinants 2 system peak coincidental demand 3 individual peak non-coincidental demand 4 some combo of the above Staff recommends utilizing the greater of 1 or 2 using Sept 12 2001 as benchmark demand day  This reflects current usage mitigated by the settlement capacity contracts Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights using El Pasos proposed expanded 20 pool system in this proposal El Paso narrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools As support of this recommendation Staff noted 1 it is consistent with the Commissions one-time delivery point allocation in BRAmocoTopock complaint case 2 gives certainty for supply to all shippers 3 enhances the tradeability of capacity 4 eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basin Commissioners Discussion Pat Wood  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective and will never be approved by him  Whether the Staff recommendation is the best fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will be different -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlements intent was to keep the system viable at all and changes are needed to move to next step Wood also noted that this wouldnt have happened if El Paso had complied with Order 636 -- its a lesson on the power side that we not carve out exceptions Nora Brownell  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled and if this addresses future capacity needs  Staff responded that this is an economic fix to the current disincentives for El Paso expansions and that there are proposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs Bill Massey Stated that the current situation is intolerable and that Staffs presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because bold Commission action is necessary here Linda Breathitt  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelines using FR service and was told no only some intrastate municipalities still utilize FR on a commodity demand basis See attached file G-1March13ppt Nancy Bagot Manager Govt Affairs Northern Natural Gas Co 1500 K Street NW Suite 400 Washington DC  20005 202-216-1129 direct dial

X-FileName khyatt Non-Privilegedpst A Womens Primer on Men  Dont know if youve seen this or not  TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHOS HAD ENOUGH  You really want to figure us out  Heres a start  1  Learn to work the toilet seat If its up put it down We need it up  you need it down You dont hear us gripping about you leaving it down do  you  No of course not  That would be stupid and there are far more  important things to be worried about  You dont try to sit in the drivers  seat without opening the dammed car door do you  2  If you wont dress like the Victorias Secret girls dont expect us to  act like soap opera guys  3  If you think youre fat you probably are Dont ask us Its a stupid  question and we refuse to answer  4  Dont cut your hair Ever Long hair is always more attractive than  short hair  Period  One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is  that married women always cut their hair and by then youre stuck with her  5  Birthdays Valentines and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can  find the perfect present yet again  6  Heres a real easy one  If you ask a question you dont want an answer  to expect an answer you dont want to hear  7  Asking opinionated questions that you already have an answer to and  then getting pissed off because we gave our honest answer in the opposite  direction is a really stupid thing to do  8  Sometimes were not thinking about you Live with it  9  Dont ask us what were thinking about unless you are prepared to  discuss such topics as navel lint the shotgun formation or monster trucks  10  Sunday  Sports Its like the full moon or the changing of the tides  Let it be  11  Shopping is not a sport and no were never going to think of it that  way  12  When we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine  Really  13  You have enough clothes  14  You have too many shoes  15  Crying is blackmail and you know it  Knock it off  16  Lets be clear on this one  Ask for what you want I repeat ask for  what you want  Subtle hints dont work Strong hints dont work Really  obvious hints dont work Just say it  No your having to ask for something  does NOT automatically make it not worth getting  If it did you might as  well give back the car the house and that last raise you got  And NO  trying to punish us by acting like you dont want the thing 30 seconds after  you were compelled to ask for it will not teach us a lesson or jumpstart  the ESP gland within our underdeveloped craniums  Heres the math write it  down somewhereASK  GETNO ASK  NO GET  17  No we dont know what day it is We never will Mark anniversaries on  the calendar  18  Peeing standing up is more difficult Were bound to miss sometimes  19  Most guys own three pairs of shoes What makes you think wed be any  good at choosing which pair out of thirty would look good with your dress  20  Whether or not you believe it yes and no are perfectly acceptable  answers to almost every question  21  Come to us with a problem if you want help solving it Thats what we  do  Occasionally we can go out on a limb and attempt to empathize  However be warned that approaching us with a problem without clearly  indicating which you want solutions or empathy will likely result in you  getting neither  Tricky system but thats just the way it works  22  Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for  23  A headache that lasts for 17 months is a medical problem See a doctor  24  Foreign films are best left to foreigners Unless its Bruce Lee or  Jackie Chan where it doesnt really matter what theyre saying  25  Check your oil  26  If we tell you that you look beautiful at 530 in the morning or any  other time when you are dirty mussed up or otherwise not perfectly  coiffed we really do mean it  Telling us that we dont really pisses us  off and further decreases the likelihood of your hearing anything of the  sort when you are fishing for compliments  27  It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together  28  No it doesnt matter which quiz  29  Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument  30  All comments become null and void after 7 days  31  If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways  makes you sad or angry we meant the other one  32  Let us ogle stare Were going to look anyway its genetic and we  know you do it too  33  You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something  but not both  34  Whenever possible please say whatever you have to say during  commercials  35  If it itches it will be scratched  36  If we ask whats wrong and you say nothing we will act like  nothings wrong  If we ask and you say that something is wrong we would  greatly appreciate your helping us out by actually telling us what it is  before our aforementioned inability to read minds once again quickly takes  the place of the actual issue at hand  37  When we are with the guys or watching sports or both we are bound  to look say do or act stupid  It doesnt bother us  It shouldnt bother  you  Thank you for reading this Yes I know I have to sleep on the couch  tonight  We really dont mind that though its kind of like camping and  we get the remote all to ourselves  Sincerely  The Men

this is the overview of Gordon  Let me know if I can provide any additional information ANNE E STRYKER Title I Coordinator Maud W Gordon Elementary 713-295-3767  ---------- From 	Brenner Arlene  Sent 	Wednesday May 16 2001 1201 PM  To 	Stryker Anne E  Subject 	Gordon Elementary School  Gordon Elementary School which is located in Bellaire is an HISD school  which is used solely as a relief school for the overcrowded and capped  schools in Southwest Houston Everyone of the 500 students who attend  Gordon is bused to the school from the Gulfton Fondren Southwest and  Westbury areas These children who attend classes from kindergarten to  fifth grade come from families that are primarily immigrants refugees  and first generation Americans They represent every inhabited continent  except Australia so far All of Latin America has been represented at  our school including the Caribbean as are most of the major Asian nations  such as India Pakistan Vietnam and Mainland China European and Middle  Eastern countries such as Bosnia Kosovo Saudi Arabia and Iran have also  been represented At last count we have enrolled children from more than  ten Africa countries including Rwanda Ethiopia Somalia Sierra Leone  and Nigeria We also have American born inner city children as well  However our school is overwhelming Hispanic which at last count was 77  per cent  In term of needs although most of our families have one or  more parents working the number of students receiving free or reduced  lunch this year was 98 2 per cent which is down from last years figures  of 99 per cent We have had 100 per cent in years pass as well These  numbers indicate the percentage of families below the poverty level As a  result we provide students with free or reduced lunch and breakfast each  day We also provide a free extended day program What that means is that  some of our children get on buses as early as 615 am and dont return  home until almost 600 pm What we have discovered over the years is that  the needs dont stop there We have learned to stock or attempt to supply  all sorts of items We try to stock RID over the counter head lice  treatment as well as underwear and socks for little ones who have  accidents We have an on going need for school supplies childrens  shirts blouses slacks and jumpers as well as sweaters and jackets for  Houstons short winter We try to give each student one gift at Christmas  because we discovered that many families dont have the money to provide  their children with more than the basics We try to collect used bicycles  to give away as door prizes for our family math and family reading nights  to encourage parents to get involve in school Both our library and  classrooms are in need of literature books both in English and in Spanish  We do not have a PTO so we have to find other sources to provide treats  for field day or field trips or special day activities We are always in  need of tutors We struggle to support our own home grown soccer league  We take the funds we collect from our Fall Festival Halloween Carnival  to pay for a school wide field trip to the Oil Ranch which gives children  an opportunity to see cows and chickens and cattle and to paddleboat on a  lake We pay for those children who cannot afford the 5 admission fee and  we pay for the bus transportation We try to underwrite the cost of buses  for field trips and we raise funds for cultural performances such as  plays or musical performances because we realize this is the only  exposure most of our children experience We have been slowly  incorporating MacIntosh computers into classrooms and are always in need  of assistance in that area especially for the upper grades We have wanted  for a long time to plant bushes around our 9 t-buildings to make our  campus more attractive for our children because so many of them stare at  concrete apartment surroundings On a personal level I wish I could  provide my teachers with tokens of appreciation that PTOs so often give to  teachers but I have only sporadically been able to accomplish this

three coming with me brings that total to 16 cans of CBU-87thats 3232 individual submunitions for themthats what I want I want 4 Maverick missiles per jetthats 16 of those thingsand if we run outta trucks and other small things to hit with those missiles I wanna find out what a maverick will do when it locks onto a terrorist and hits him at just over 1000 feet per secondthere might not be enough deceleration to detonate the thing but at that speed I dont think it would be necessary And I want 2 pods of rockets hanging from my wings Seven white phosphorous and seven HEI I want the Willie Petes to put a cloud of smoke to climb into the sky to let everyone following knowthats where the gettin is good And the HEI well I just want FRAG in the air tearing apart their greasy scumbag bodies the

AMERICAN as the intro to Monday Night Air StrikesFight night would have a whole new meaning nowI want to see Sports Center air the HIT OF THE DAYTodays strike comes from a flight of two A-10 Warthogs

of doing my Fiber Links business and I didnt come away too terribly impressed  Its undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant David Sokol both have a reputation for finding ways to make money but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of Mid-American that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River  Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world Jeff ps  While at Mojave Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas controloperations puke like the rest of us  Hes apparently done quite well at KRGT Williams to sell Kern River for nearly 1B Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings for nearly 1 billion MidAmerican a unit of investor Warren Buffets Berkshire Hathaway will pay Williams 450 million in cash and assume 510 million of Williams debt in order to acquire Kern River The deal part of Williams ongoing effort to strengthen its balance sheet is set to close by March 31 assuming regulatory approvals Williams said selling the Kern River system will save the company about 126 billion in capital expenses over the next 18 months MidAmerican meanwhile said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline which currently has a capacity of 835000 Mcfday and extends 926 miles from Opal Wyo to Californias San Joaquin Valley Built in 1992 it is a key route for shipping Rocky Mountain gas to markets in the western United States particularly Southern California The expansion project due to be completed in May 2003 will more than double the pipelines capacity to 17 Bcfday according to a filing Williams submitted to FERC in August The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed 2 billion MidAmerican said in a release We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission which we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America said David Sokol MidAmericans chairman and CEO Upon completion of the sale Kern River will become a subsidiary of MidAmerican Bob Sluder senior vice president and general man-ager of Williams Kern River and Northwest systems will become president of the new MidAmerican subsidiary As for Williams We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies which now require com-panies like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investment-grade credit rating President and CEO Steve Malcolm said The sale of our Kern River sys-tem is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our busi-nesses now and in the future Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsa-based company delayed the release of its 2001 earnings to iron out debt issues related to the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary which it spun off last year Ear-lier this week Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance 14 billion of WGC-related debt GD 35 Williams stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the heightened scrutiny of US energy merchant companies in the wake of Enrons bankrupt-cy in December GD 124 In releasing its earnings Thursday Williams reported a 2001 net loss of 4777 mil-lion or 95share compared with net earnings of 5243 million or 117share in 2000 The 2001 loss includes pre-tax charges of 205 billion relating to WGC WGC said income from continuing operations for 2001 was 8354 million compared with 9654 million a year earlier The total WCG-related charges of 205 billion repre-sents 80 of the total WCG-related guarantees and payment obligations and the deferred payment for services provided to WCG Williams said Also Thursday Williams said it will raise 275 million through the sale of 9875 cumu-lative convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings MEHC will acquire 146 million shares of the security at a price of 18750share with each share of the security convertible into 10 shares of Williams stock The deal is expect-ed to close by March 31 and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction MidAmerican headquartered in Des Moines Iowa is a
