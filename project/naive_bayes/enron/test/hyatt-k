website is Benelliusa.com
	
Recent pricing on two models is:

Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is $1145.  This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.

Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl is $845.  You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black syn stock) for same price.  Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.  Both come with 5 choke tubes.

Let me know if you have further questions.

vision is pretty blurry, but will clear up a little bit every day.  I can't see through my glasses anymore because they have a correction.  He wants me to wait at least 6 weeks before deciding the strength of any correction.  I have to see him again in a couple of weeks.  I  can actually see better in the right eye than I could in the left after they did that one, but we did the worst one first, so that is probably why.  Anyway, all is well.  I'm staying in today but hope to get out some tomorrow and Sunday and Monday, of course. 
 
Hope you both have a wonderful weekend.

The Sun Devil model is pretty big, over 2000kb, I'm not sure how well it will email but we can try it.  We may want to send a backup on a 100mb zip drive disk.  Do they have the ability to read the zip disk?

Bill, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.

We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.  They are interested in purchasing approx. 35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.  The pipe in located in Ward and Pecos County, Texas.  

Once the C.A. is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc.

Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.  Their info is as follows:

Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc.
Mr. Philip R. Allard, President
502 S. Koenigheim, Suite 3A
San Angelo, Texas 76903
ph 915-655-3300
fax 915-655-3315

let me know if you need any further info.

Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
opts to 
use it to meet any credit requirements.

I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
with 
both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
on 
interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline 
about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded

questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
deliveries 
from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point 
to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
on 
TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
transportation 
inevitably comes up. 

Thanks
David

Kevin, I did your time today since I will be out until Tuesday of next week.  What I did was go ahead and put you away on Friday (I can always go back in and change that when I return if you decide you can't take that day).  The important aspect to tell you about this is that I didn't put it as Vacation, rather as your Discretionary Holiday.  If worse comes....you will be compensated for untaken vacation days but not for that discretionary day.  So...................

Hi Jim-

	I hope your conversation with Paul Cherry went well last week.  Paul indicated to me that you might be sending a Conf Agrmt for us to execute so you could then pass along to us some of the debt covenant waterfall language.  I'll be happy to push that agreement thru the channels here once you send it.  If you feel it might be faster for us to send you our standard form agreement, let me know.

Also, along those same confidential lines, if you can provide to me some various operating scenarios for the plant (high, low, and base case operating assumptions) I can begin designing an SFV rate for you to look at.  Let me know please.

thanks

Subject: Why did the chicken cross the road?


A new updated version.....

 -----

KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.

PLATO: For the greater good.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.

KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

DR. TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let
it take.

SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justified
in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.

HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.

ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a
threatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced with
significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for
the newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering
relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical
distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry
Integration Model(PIM),
Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge,
capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and
technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management
framework.

Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and
best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the
transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in
order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit,
and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the
implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing
an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry
cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting,
enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically
based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unified
market message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and core
values.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total business
integration solution. In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chicken
manage change to become more successful.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken
crossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.

DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be
free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.

MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken,
"Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there
was much rejoicing.

FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes. How many more
chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?

RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did
NOT cross the road.

MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why?
The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.

JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone
ever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing walking around
all over the place, anyway?"

SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken
crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will not
only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and
balance your checkbook.

OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road?
"Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we
overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"

CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally
selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically
endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved
beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.

COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.

BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with the
chicken.

Kevin,
Sorry to be a pest about this but my wife is being insistent that we are off base on the sizes.
My adopted child is 4 years old and she is listing sizes of 7 shirt/8 pants and 12 shoes.
My wife says that she buys clothes for our nieces:  one of which is six years old and wears
a size 7 and shoe size 2.
Our adopted child is two years younger and asking for the same size in clothes and asking for shoe size 12?

I don't want to be a pest but my wife is concerned on the sizes and we don't want to goof up when we give the clothes to Rocio.
Is there a way to see what other 4 year olds are asking for in sizes?

I have another request.  Would you please see if Brad Petzold is still with Enron?  I think he runs a company in Pittsburgh that sells franchises for improving operations of commercial heating and air conditioning.  Could you please get me the name of the company and the telephone number?
 
Thanks for everything and take care.
Steve

Didn't David's son play baseball with Austin?  I think I saw him last night with his son at Austin's basketball practice.

This is a Russian built Antonov-12   (Russian equiv.of the C-130 Herc).  I brought it in this afternoon, put 12 tons of pipe on it for Barcelona, Venz. You might recognize David Howser in a cpl of them.

Bonnie White is the attorney.  I have already called her to find out what our collection process is (if any).  I know some guys named Guido and Mario who'll be happy to do it for 50% of the money.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Martha Stewart's Tips for Arkansans
 
 GENERAL:

1. Never take a beer to a job interview
2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.
3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.
4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.
5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is
still considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.


DINING OUT:

1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt the
paper cup and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.
2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.


ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:

1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared
by a taxidermist.
2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good
his manners are.


PERSONAL HYGIENE:

1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that
should done in private, using one's OWN truck keys.
2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.
3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.
4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend
to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.


DATING (Outside the Family):

1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.
2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: "I've been wanting to
go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago".
3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back.
Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say "Monday." If the latter is
the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.


THEATER ETIQUETTE:

1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up
immediately after the movie has ended.
2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have
proven they can't hear you.


WEDDINGS:

1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.
2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.
3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund
and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.
4. Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for that
special occasion.


DRIVING ETIQUETTE:

1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun
is loaded and the deer is in sight.
2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest
tires does not always have the right of way.
3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.
4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is
impolite to ask her to bring back beer too.

Kevin,

It was good to talk with you this morning.  As mentioned to you yesterday, =
following is some information on a project that I've been working on.  I'd =
appreciate your assitance in getting the word out regarding this project.  =
=20

As you are aware, there are many families that have been affected by the re=
cent layoffs at Enron.  I along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler a=
nd Sue Nix) have been working on a project which will provide assistance to=
 ex-employees of Enron. We wanted to do something to help our fellow employ=
ees and also provide a tool that others could use to provide assistance to =
ex-Enron employees.   Just think, if 100 people donated $50 each that would=
 be $5000 that we could give to ex-employees for assistance as needed for b=
asic necessities (such as money for food, to pay their rent/mortgage, or ut=
ilites).  I know the ex-employees would really appreciate this assistance. =
 I've already started getting e-mails at eerfarequest@surfmk.com <mailto:ee=
rfarequest@surfmk.com> requesting assistance.  We've set up guidelines on h=
ow we'll be distributing the funds. This week, we've been working with an a=
ttorney and a local bank. An account has been set up where people can make =
contributions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron employees that =
need assistance with basic necessities, such as money for food, rent/mortga=
ge payments, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the inform=
ation so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our abil=
ity to provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As you=
 can see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would appre=
ciate your assistance with communicating this information to the current En=
ron employees. =20

Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron=
 employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.=

Subject: Presentation, discussion on El Paso FR vs. CD


Attached at the bottom of this email is the Staff powerpoint presentation
on their recommendation to the Commission on El Paso's Full Requirements
service (FR).  The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.

Summary

As noted in yesterday's email, Staff is recommending the following general
principles:
-  The Commission convert El Paso's Full Requirements service (FR) to
Contract Demand service (CD)
- Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper's billing
determinants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (a
shipper's own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001
- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on
El Paso's proposed 20 pooling point configuration
- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by the
Commissioners, on the Staff recommendations

Background

Staff recounted the issue on El Paso's system, including the question to be
decided by the Commission: has El Paso's FR service become unjust and
unreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within the
Commission's jurisdiction to allocate El Paso's capacity in order to:
      (1) restore system flexibility
      (2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firm
delivery
      (3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso's system

According to Staff's presentation, the problems on El Paso's system are due
to changes in system load since the pipeline's 1996 settlement.  A major
increase in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996
(which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operations
and capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacity
constraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement's
resultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso to
expand or upgrade its system.

Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)

Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining
(1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a small
amount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities),
with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will "balance the interests
of all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system."  Also, it
will send the proper price signals for system expansions.

In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended four
allocation methods for the converted CD:
      (1) 1996 settlement bid determinants
      (2) system peak (coincidental demand)
      (3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)
      (4) some combo of the above

Staff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001,
as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by the
settlement capacity contracts.

Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights,
using El Paso's proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Paso
narrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools].
As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:
      (1) it is consistent with the Commission's one-time delivery point
allocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case
      (2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers
      (3) enhances the tradeability of capacity
      (4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basin

Commissioners' Discussion

Pat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective and
will never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is the
best fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference.
Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will be
different -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement's intent was to
keep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step.
Wood also noted that "this wouldn't have happened if El Paso had complied
with Order 636 -- it's a lesson on the power side that we not carve out
exceptions."

Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure,
how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addresses
future capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is "an economic fix to
the current disincentives for El Paso expansions," and that there are
proposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.

Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is "intolerable" and that
Staff's presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because
"bold Commission action is necessary here."

Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelines
using FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalities
still utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.

I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.

A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.  Many of these people sacrificed some of their own Christmas so that kids at Gordon Elementary would not be let down.  I would like them to know that their efforts were truly appreciated by the students, faculty, and especially those of us on the Committee.  Would you please consider posting on your site the attached thank-you letter from the school? 

thank you

SAD NEWS ABOUT BEER
You have to hope that this study is flawed, but the evidence seems irrefutable.  Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that the results of a recent analysis revealed the presence of female hormones in beer, and suggested that men should take a look at their beer consumption.

The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women.  To test the theory, 100 men were each fed 6 pints of beer within a one-hour period.  It was then observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing, had to sit down to pee, couldn't perform sexually, and refused to apologize when wrong.


No further testing is planned.

Hi Don--
	I picked up one of your flyers.  I'm looking for storage for my 2000 Expedition to hold hunting equipment.  What configurations do you have?  Also, would you be willing to sell the plans (copyrighted of course).  I have a pretty extensive wood shop and might want to make the box myself.  

thanks

Eric, here are my thoughts on your Sun Devil issues.

I assume that a guarantee will not include Liquidated Damages, if it does we would want to rethink the response.  However,

?	Current Sun Devil facility design and cost estimates are based upon a 24hr MDQ to match with existing TW Mainline services.
?	Additional facilities will be required to accommodate 24hr ratable nominations at shipper receipt points.
?	Minimum delivery pressures of 500-600 psi should not be an issue for current Sun Devil scope (at 24hr MDQ).  We will run transient modeling to confirm.
?	If requested, we can re-design and re-estimate Sun Devil at a 16hr MDQ, 24hr ratable noms at receipt points and minimum delivery pressure obligations (with Liquidated Damages or not), but it will be enormously more expensive than the current proposed Sun Devil project.
?	Notwithstanding the engineering required to provide these types of services, there may be issues with existing certificates, tariffs, customers etc. due to the fact that Sun Devil gas will run in the same pipeline facilities along with existing Transwestern services.  But I'm not much of an authority in that area.
?	If you would like us to proceed with the re-design and re-estimate please advise John Keller and he will start the paperwork.

Phil,

I wanted to get your thoughts on service conditions that we're discussing with prospective Sun Devil shippers.

Hourly swings.  We've indicated that the shippers can nominate 1/16th of their MaxDQ at delivery points in any hour subject to-
- Proper notice
- 24 hour ratable nominations at receipt points
- no obligation on the pipeline to deliver more than the MaxDQ in any gas day

Pressure guarantee.  All prospective shippers are power generators and they want pressure guarantees in the range of 500-600 psig.

Hi Jose--
	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html

One of our proposed speaking topics is "Changing Gas Quality Specs"  and
the impact to today's turbines which are supposedly much more sensitive
to gas specs than older generation units.  Another potential topic is
"Pressure Reliability" dealing with the impact to gen units with varying
fuel pressures.

I'm looking for an expert at GE Power Systems who would be willing to
give a 15-30 minute presentation on either of these topics on the
afternoon of March 20, 2002.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other
presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

If you have someone who may be interested, please let me know and I can
send them a formal invitation or just have them call me direct.  Thanks
for the help!

Dear Dr. Lay--
	
	Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the "crack" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.  

Thanks for your continued hard work and support.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

David, 
	glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?

It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.

stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you.
Kevin

Jeff--
	per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:

Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d
Volume to Cal Border     -  30,000
San Juan receipts		 - 780,000

Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu

We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24)
and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).

Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.

PRESS RELEASE:Utilicorp Unit To Develop Ariz. Facility >UCU
Jan 31 at 15:20

  ( BW)(MO-AQUILA)(UCU) Aquila Set to Develop Arizona Gas Storage Facility
  Business Editors
  KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002--Aquila, the wholly owned
subsidiary of UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU), announced today that it has
purchased the Red Lake Storage Project from Southwest Gas Corporation.
  The purchase includes 36,000 acres approximately 30 miles north of Kingman,
Arizona, and the rights to develop a salt cavern storage facility. Along with
the land, Aquila purchased the water and mineral rights necessary to develop the
facility.
  The facility will have a gas storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf).
The first phase of the facility, with a storage capacity of 6 Bcf, is expected
to be in operation by the fourth quarter of 2003, with the full 12 Bcf planned
for the fourth quarter of 2004. The facility will connect to pipelines operated
by El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline and Transwestern Pipeline Company. Aquila
anticipates beginning an open season for the facility within the next seven to
ten days. In an open season period a company seeks storages commitments from
potential clients.
  "This facility fits with our strategy to build or acquire assets that enable
us to provide clients with the energy they need when they encounter dramatic
increases in demand," said Ed Mills, president and chief operating officer of
Aquila.
  The facility is positioned to serve Arizona power plants, as well as other
facilities in Nevada and California. There are approximately 60 gas-fired power
plants in Arizona, representing one of the largest single concentrations of such
facilities in the United States
  "Southwest Gas Corporation is pleased to see the Red Lakes Storage Project
being developed," said Ed Zub, executive vice president of Southwest Gas
Corporation. "Development of this project will benefit the states of Arizona and
Nevada where Southwest Gas Corporation serves more than 1.1 million customers."
  Aquila currently owns one of the largest independent storage facilities in the
southwest, a 21 Bcf facility in Katy, Texas. The company is also currently
completing the acquisition of a storage facility near Lodi, California, which
will provide gas to the frequently energy-short cities in northern California.
With the addition of the Red Lake Storage Project, Aquila will be one of the
largest independent storage providers for power plants and local gas
distribution companies in the Southwest.
  Based in Kansas City, Aquila is a leading wholesaler of natural gas, power and
coal in North America and provider of risk management services. Aquila also
provides wholesale energy and risk management services in the United Kingdom,
Germany and Scandinavia. Aquila is wholly owned by Kansas City-based UtiliCorp
United, an international energy company with 4 million customers across the U.S.
and in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. Additional

1369.

Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.

Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  

Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.

If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.

Subject:	TW lateral pipe sale

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

Guys,
Would you like to adopt a kid?  And no, you do not have to legally adopt the kid (believe it or not that is one of the questions that was asked which totally cracked me up).  I am assisting Kevin Hyatt and we have 240 kids left.  Fire Sale!  Get your kid now, happy hour special, two for one all the time!  Just give me your money and I will shop (imagine that - I will shop).

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 


 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

Dear Team--

	We are evaluating the potential sale of TW's existing 20-inch diameter Gomez lateral in Pecos and Ward County, Texas and have executed a confidentiality agreement with the proposed buyer (Pioneer Gas Pipeline).  The buyer would like to begin the due diligence process as early as possible and has asked to review  info related to the following:

	1) Maintenance records for last 3 years
	2) right-of-way / easement agreements

The potential benefits to TW of this transaction include 1) monetizing an asset that today is generating zero value and 2) creating a new source of gas supply into TW from the buyer.

Questions I have are:

	a) Can we designate a "point" person from the Monahans Team that I can coordinate with and who would that be?
	b) Where / who has the records & documents for the items above?

Your timely response is greatly appreciated.  Please coordinate with me all questions / concerns.  I ask that no information (verbal or written) be passed to any interested outside party without prior clearance with me.   

thanks for your help!!  I can be reached in Houston at 713-853-5559.

According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

Kevin,

Who in legal have you been working with?  Tracy was wondering when we thought we would receive the money.

Thanks, Kim.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Jean,
	I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.

Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).

So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?

thanks,
Kevin

Following up on our conversation re: Red Lake storage

assuming only a Phoenix lateral gets built off TW, no mainline or SJ expansion:
	Capital cost is estimated at $304mm.

A fully subscribed rate on volume of 750,000/d to get a 15% ROR would be $.152/MMBtu (with zero fuel retention).

If we assume a more gradual volume ramping up, beginning with 50% load factor in year 1 climbing to 100% in year 8, the target transport rate would need to be $.248 (closer to my "top of the head" $.30 we discussed yesterday).

Both of these scenarios assume 80/20 Debt/equity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 1/3 of the capital cost.

Also,
regarding the Kern River expansion, what might the likelihood be of Mojave receiving Kern gas and backhauling to TW for delivery into Aquila Red Lake?  If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.  

Let me know what you think

Allan-- we estimate 40-55% of the Enron sponsors have been severed, this would translate to approx. 200 kids.  Of these, we have only needed to re-sponsor 12 children, but we won't know the final tally until Friday afternoon.  

I also understand HISD public relations is issuing a PR today inviting all the press to Gordon elementary next week.  The Holiday Party is 12/20.  HISD phone is 713-892-6393.  

Below is description of Gordon Elementary given to me by the school.  

Let me know if you have questions.

Kevin,
attached is the Sun Devil powerpoint presentation we gave to Stan back in December.  I added one slide since called Project Rationale.  The document probably has more detail than you need but more is better right?  Let me know if you need help cutting it down.

Dean, 
	based on your schedule, how does Tues March 26 in the morning look for you to review the maintenance records for the Gomez lateral with Phil Allard from Pioneer?  How long do you think it will take, including a drive following the lateral route?

I would plan to fly out to Midland from Houston that Monday night, and be at the office for the meeting on Tuesday morning.  

Let me know as soon as you can please.

thanks

I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  

How do I get them comfortable?
Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when?
Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?

Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.

I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.

A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.  Many of these people sacrificed some of their own Christmas so that kids at Gordon Elementary would not be let down.  I would like them to know that their efforts were truly appreciated by the students, faculty, and especially those of us on the Committee.  Would you please consider posting on your site the attached thank-you letter from the school?

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

the first EP one (Line No. 2000) went in service in August.  The 2nd one (line 2000 Power up) is the one they didn't get very many takers on in the open season that closed 8/2/01.

James, can you please run 2 cases to calculate a backhaul rate to Phoenix using Sun Devil?

case 1: Using the Capex of $290,181,156 (which includes the Red Hawk lateral), what does the rate need to be using 100% load factors for 20 years with the terminal value and our hurdle return rate of 15%?  Assume fuel at 0% for the entire term (source of gas would likely be Cal border area storage facilities).

case 2: same as above but load factors as follows:

year 1-2		50%
year 3-4		70
year 5-7		85
year 8-20	100%

We are trying to respond to Panda Energy by Friday 2/22.

We have you scheduled to present on the subject of Pipeline Infrastructure Security.  We plan to hold a conference call in January or February 2002 with the Chair and the other presenters participating.  You will be notified with the date and time for the conference call.  For now, plan to present for about 15 -20 minutes on the subject.  Time should be allotted at the end for a question & answer session.  
By November 15, please submit a one to two paragraph abstract on the subject.  Around January 15, 2002 we will need your final paper/presentation for publishing with the CD Rom proceedings that will bed istributed to every delegate attending the conference.  In addition, your presentation will be available on the ELECTRIC POWER website at www.electricpowerexpo.com <http://www.electricpowerexpo.com/>.   
Enclosed are the preliminary conference brochures for the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE and ELECTRIC POWER 2002 Conference.  
The NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE and ELECTRIC POWER 2002 Conference & Exhibition is sponsored by POWER Magazine and is committed to providing a valuable andm eaningful forum for operating companies in the changing power generationi ndustry. Whether their roots are in a traditional electric utility or ani ndependent power producer, these companies face the challenge of generating clean, reliable power in a competitive market. An industry-based AdvisoryC ommittee has programmed the Conference, with input from the ELECTRIC POWERG enCo Alliance Members that own/operate more than 250,000 mega-watts of generating capacity.   
Thank you for agreeing to participate.  A formal confirmation package will be sent in December with complete details on the conference call, hotel & travel information and other items to help prepare you for the conference.  Take care. 
Best regards,

Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?

Ben and Ron--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?

thanks

Guys,
	is there a way you can tell me what the MMBtu content of the gas is coming into TW from NorthWest Pipeline, TransColorado, and then what it is at Gallup?

I'm looking for historical info for say the last 6 months.

Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.  I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site.

Sure.  Probably the best method is for us to overnight them to you -- we can email filings made at the Commission if you can use an Image reading program -- I'll work with my assistant on it and may do a test with you.

spoke with Bill Morgan.  At this point, he only has Mon - Tues 1/14-15 open.  He may have other openings if there are cancellations, we just have to let him know so he can call us.  The rut just started, they've taken some bucks off the place.  If we wanted to hunt an extra day, because we were there before, he would charge $150 per shooter.  If you wanted to bring a 3rd party, price would be the full $500 for a 2 day hunt.

Let me know what you want to do.  I'm flexible.

No meeting today but here's the update.

We had our meeting with AZ Public Service on Friday 11/16.  Here's the highlights:

30 year term is not a deal killer
Rates & fuel are high but San Juan gas price helps
They like the pressure guarantee
They like being able to swing the volume within the day

APS has electric line ROW that may include underground ROW going south towards El Paso.  If so, we may be able to use this path to reach Panda and the El Paso system at a reduced cost.  APS will check it out and get back with me. 

Next steps:  meetings are being set up with Duke, Sempra, and PG&E for the week after Thanksgiving.

El Paso / FERC full requirments debate:
	A straw man settlement proposal was floated at FERC by one of the FR shippers.  FERC still wants the parties to negotiate a settlement but so far there has been little progress.

	Panda Energy - Presented capacity offer to Panda on 11/6.  They liked the swing capability, but fuel will likely be an issue.  They will present the offer to 	their partner TECO.  We expect their counter offer by week end 11/16.
	AZ Public Service -  Scheduled next meeting for 11/16 in Phoenix.  Working on finishing Pre-pay and SFV rate designs.
El Paso / FERC  - No word yet on direction of Full Requirements settlement.

Paula, I was not listed on your memo re RDI and I have had access since June.  Kevin Hyatt and I work together using this software and in deciding whether to get 1 or 2 accesses, we need to know the price.  Could you let me know that so I can approach our VP about this.
 
Hope all is going great for you.

We will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year.  I think for this year we'll be fine.

All,
If you read the question/answer area regarding the merger it appears that the matching fund program may not survive.  Therefore, we may need to do more shopping with our Enron Kid account funds than we originally planned.  Do we need to meet to discuss a contingency plan?
Thanks, LV

I got this information out a little late last year so here is a heads up.  The Needles 38th annual golf tournament is scheduled for the 5th and 6th of April.  The tournament involves Transwestern, SoCal, El Paso, PG&E, Soutwest etc....

Randy Williams (team leader for the Kingman team) can be contacted for additional information.  Also, Randy, would you please put Steve, Kim and Kevin on your distribution list for the golf registration flyers once they become available.  

Oh yea, if dollars are available we could use about 60 dozen golf balls or any items that you might like distributed during the tournament.  If you or someone from your group would like to tie the golf tournament into a quick tour of the Red Rock facilities let me know and I will coordinate those details.  Thanks

FERC has announced a technical conference for discusssion of allocation issues on El Paso's system for April 16, 2002.
Click below for the notice:

http://cips.ferc.gov/Q/CIPS/GAS/RP/RP00-336.002.TXT

At the public meeting on March 13, staff made a presentation, recommending that El Paso convert Full Requirements shippers to Contract Demand; provide capacity rights of the greater of billing determinant or coincidental peak; maintain the existing rate structure; maintain the 1996 settlement; and accept El Paso's proposed 20 pooling areas up from the existing 3 areas. Staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is unreliable and recommended the Commission set a technical conference.

Sun Devil Project

	El Paso Full Requirements contracts - this debate was stricken from FERC's agenda again this week (for the 3rd time) indicating dissent among Commissioners on how best to settle the allocation of El Paso's system serving Arizona and California markets.  We may see a draft allocation order circulated prior to the next FERC meeting on 3/14.

	Az Public Service - Conference call was held 2/28 to discuss the latest proposal.  APS remains hesitant to make any project commitment until they have a clearer direction from FERC on their EP full requirements contract.  APS is forwarding to TW their likely operating scenarios for the 2000 Mw Red Hawk plant so we can draft an SFV rate design.

	The Arizona Corporation Commission granted permit approval this week to a new 1000 Mw gas-fired power plant in southeast Arizona.  The new Bowie plant sits on the El Paso south system and is slated to be on-line in 2004.  The new plant will only add to the capacity pressure on El Paso.

	Panda Energy - credit discussions were held outlining the provisions ETS would like to see from Panda to support a transport agreement.  Panda is forwarding to us the cash waterfall language from their debt agreements that puts the fuel supply (including transport) and electric transmission payments ahead of all others (including bondholders).

Subject: Ireland vs Iran



Subject: IRAN vs. IRELAND

Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering whom to invade next when
his telephone rang.

"Hallo! Mr. Hussein," a heavily accented voice said. "This is Paddy down
at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we
are officially declaring war on you!"

"Well, Paddy," Saddam replied, "This is indeed important news! How big is
your army?"

"Right now," said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, "there is myself,
my cousin Sean, my next door neighbour Seamus, and the entire dart team from
the pub. That makes eight!"

Saddam paused. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my
army waiting to move on my command."

"Begorra!", said Paddy. "I'll have to ring you back!"

Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. "Mr. Hussein, the war is
still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!"

"And what equipment would that be, Paddy?" Saddam asked.

"Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor."

Saddam sighed. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and
14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1-1/2
million since we last spoke."

"Saints preserve us!" said Paddy. "I'll have to get back to you."

Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. "Mr. Hussein, the war is
still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified
Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four
boys from the Shamrock pub have joined us as well!"

Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. "I must tell
you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My
military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. 
And
since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!"

"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!", said Paddy, "I'll have to ring you back."

Sure enough, Paddy called again the next day. "Top o' the mornin', Mr.
Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war."

"I'm sorry to hear that," said Saddam. "Why the sudden change of heart?"

"Well," said Paddy, "we've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and
there's no way we can feed two million prisoners."

Jeff--
	per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:

Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d
Volume to Cal Border     -  30,000
San Juan receipts		 - 780,000

Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu

We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24)
and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).

Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.

Ben and Ron--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/13?

thanks

Dear Phil,
	Hope you received the easement and line maps OK.  We are pulling the maintenance records together and should have this done by 3/15.  How does your calendar look for Friday 3/22 to meet at the Monahans office or early the week of 3/25.  Prior to 3/22 I will be out of the office at a power convention in St. Louis, returning Thursday 3/21.  I could then meet you at Monahans on 3/22 or sometime the following week.

let me know.

I am a project manager with Harris Group in Denver.  We specialize in the
design of compressor stations and have considerable experience in the
western U.S.  I was hoping to get an update from you on the Sun Devil
Expansion project.  Have you applied with FERC?  Is there any opportunity
for our company to submit a proposal for the project?  Would you like to see
a Qualification Package that expands on our experience?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?

I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.

Let me know if you'd like to see it.

Hope you and Daphne are doing well.

Couldn't another explanation be that the Board DID UNDERSTAND the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the Chinese Walls and protections were put in place?

I don't believe the Board members would shirk their responsibilities (as you pointed out, most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions) if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals.

I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.

A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.  Many of these people sacrificed some of their own Christmas so that kids at Gordon Elementary would not be let down.  I would like them to know that their efforts were truly appreciated by the students, faculty, and especially those of us on the Committee.  Would you please consider posting on your site the attached thank-you letter from the school? 

thank you

 Can I get an instruction booklet for a model 1560 (serial 1650338)? 

Please send to:

Kevin Hyatt
18715 Hickory Ashe Dr
Humble, TX  77346

Also, my unit keeps flashing "L" and beeping after being plugged in for only a few minutes and I can't get it to quit.  Do I need to reset the unit?  I'm assuming the "L" means Laser detected.

Yep....and all the medical. He stopped smoking pot like 3-4 months ago. As you might remember he had several head injuries and was on a medication(s) to level out the ol brain waves. He quit those. Apparently, he is operating well on no meds and no pot. 

Who knew Todd might get a life! 

You know if you get one of those Ford 250s you could have instant bam anywhere you go in that flatbed!!

Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  

I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option.

We got one wood duck out of the Moccasin hole.  We stayed till about 9:30.  We did see 5 or 6 big ducks pass way over the top of the hole, but nothing came close.

There was a lot of shooting to the east of us throughout the morning, but I wasn't sure if it was you or someone else.

Subject:	Potential sale of Gomez lateral pipe
Importance:	High

Dear Team--

	We are evaluating the potential sale of TW's existing 20-inch diameter Gomez lateral in Pecos and Ward County, Texas and have executed a confidentiality agreement with the proposed buyer (Pioneer Gas Pipeline).  The buyer would like to begin the due diligence process as early as possible and has asked to review  info related to the following:

	1) Maintenance records for last 3 years
	2) right-of-way / easement agreements

The potential benefits to TW of this transaction include 1) monetizing an asset that today is generating zero value and 2) creating a new source of gas supply into TW from the buyer.

Questions I have are:

	a) Can we designate a "point" person from the Monahans Team that I can coordinate with and who would that be?
	b) Where / who has the records & documents for the items above?

Your timely response is greatly appreciated.  Please coordinate with me all questions / concerns.  I ask that no information (verbal or written) be passed to any interested outside party without prior clearance with me.   

thanks for your help!!  I can be reached in Houston at 713-853-5559.

Kevin Hyatt
Director, Asset Development

Hi Harvey--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!

Kevin -- I have a color printer for you...actually it's still on 22.  I'll either try and go pick it up or I'll have someone.  You will need to order cartridges for it.
 
Okay?

I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.

A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.  Many of these people sacrificed some of their own Christmas so that kids at Gordon Elementary would not be let down.  I would like them to know that their efforts were truly appreciated by the students, faculty, and especially those of us on the Committee.  Would you please consider posting on your site the attached thank-you letter from the school? 

thank you

Kevin--
	As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."

Here are some of the details as we know them:
	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced
	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)
	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)
	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale
	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market

What we want to know is:
	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs)
How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?

What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?

Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.
thanks for the help.

Subject:	Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program


 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

Hi Beth,
	According to the engineers, minimum pipeline delivery pressure would likely be 750 psi at the Panda interconnect.  Let me know if you have questions.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

It was nice meeting you too!  Please feel free to email or call anytime with questions or concerns regarding Austin.  I was impressed by the Study Skills program explained last night.  If this class was made a 6th grade requirement, I think it would go a long way in better preparing the kids for when they get to your class.

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

I look forward to reading his research paper, as you obviously had him working extra hard on it over Spring Break. Thanks for your involvement and support.

Attached are the notes for your meeting in Albuquerque.  Please avoid discussing the cost figures (it tends to reach competitive ears).  If anyone has any questions, or any competitive intelligence on the Sonoran project, please have them call me.

life is good, work sucks.  Things are a little tough, we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside.  We need a good natural disaster somewhere in the world to take the media heat off Enron.  Supposedly, the lead singer from Twisted Sister was in front of the building doing some kind of rap video.  Oh the depths we sunk to.....

Ron, 
	can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.

thanks

Subject:	Maximum Hourly Flow

To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.

Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:

1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440

So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.

Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.

Hey how's is everything going?  Sometimes I hate bid week, it's too busy I don't have enough time to check in with people.  Did Michelle tell you we picked up some more transport from her on TW and may no longer be looking for more.  How's the Sun Devil project going anyway?  I haven't heard any word lately.

Importance: High


Hi Harvey--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are
electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment
suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North
American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of
domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing
gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and
will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30
minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.
They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in
a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested
in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks
for the help!

Attached is the Sun Devil model using the $911mm Capex and project life of 30 years.  The model is somewhat complex and may require spending some time on the phone with James Centilli, the model's designer.  We will make ourselves available at your convenience.

Sun Devil Marketing

--  Met with Panda Energy and Tampa Electric officials and discussed the latest transport proposal.  The pricing and term were well received.  We have forwarded to Panda an outline of the credit terms TW will need as well as supply contacts and points available to them in the San Juan basin.  We are also evaluating a reverse-tilt transport offer to provide them with a lower rate in the early years, but the rate may not be enough to provide adequate coverage ratios for the pipeline project.

--	Arizona Public Service - APS responded this week to our latest offer.  Their concerns were (1) TW credit in the face of the current Enron bankruptcy, and (2) our volume offer of 200,000/day in light of the current El Paso full requirements debate.  As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW's efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.  For volume, APS may be willing to sign up for less volume and forgo the "out" clause, but this puts more of the early development risk on TW for capital required to file the FERC application.

--	Project Engineering - with Doug Cebryk's resignation, the Sun Devil project has been forwarded to Arnold Eisenstein.

Hi everyone!!

	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.    

Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!

we will cancel these weekly meetings until we get some marketing contracts signed.  Any updates will be taken care of via weekly reports or in Steve Harris' weekly staff meeting.

By now you've probably heard that Kinder-Morgan shelved their Sonoran project.

Susan, please cancel any conf room reservation.

let me know if you have questions.

see what happens when you leave the gas bidness homey?  Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.  They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.  Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.

Subject: Kern River deal



Wow ... this is huge! 

I've met with executives of Mid-American Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didn't come away too terribly impressed.  It's undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant, David Sokol, both have a reputation for finding ways to make money, but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of Mid-American that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River.  Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world?  

Jeff 

p.s.  While at Mojave, Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas control/operations puke like the rest of us.  He's apparently done quite well at KRGT.


Williams to sell Kern River for nearly $1B 
Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed 
to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings 
for nearly $1 billion. 
MidAmerican, a unit of investor Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, will pay 
Williams $450 million in cash and assume $510 million of Williams' debt in order to 
acquire Kern River. The deal, part of Williams' ongoing effort to strengthen its balance 
sheet, is set to close by March 31 assuming regulatory approvals. Williams said selling 
the Kern River system will save the company about $1.26 billion in capital expenses 
over the next 18 months. 
MidAmerican, meanwhile, said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline, 
which currently has a capacity of 835,000 Mcf/day and extends 926 miles from Opal, 
Wyo., to California's San Joaquin Valley. Built in 1992, it is a key route for shipping Rocky 
Mountain gas to markets in the western United States, particularly Southern California. 
The expansion project, due to be completed in May 2003, will more than double 
the pipeline's capacity to 1.7 Bcf/day, according to a filing Williams submitted to 
FERC in August. The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed $2 billion, 
MidAmerican said in a release. 
"We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission, which 
we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America," said David 
Sokol, MidAmerican's chairman and CEO. Upon completion of the sale, Kern River will 
become a subsidiary of MidAmerican. Bob Sluder, senior vice president and general man-ager 
of Williams' Kern River and Northwest systems, will become president of the new 
MidAmerican subsidiary. 
As for Williams, "We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to 
meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies, which now require com-panies 
like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investment-grade 
credit rating," President and CEO Steve Malcolm said. "The sale of our Kern River sys-tem 
is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our busi-nesses 
now and in the future." 
Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsa-based 
company delayed the release of its 2001 earnings to iron out debt issues related to 
the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary, which it spun off last year. Ear-lier 
this week, Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance $1.4 billion 
of WGC-related debt (GD 3/5). 
Williams' stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the 
heightened scrutiny of U.S. energy merchant companies in the wake of Enron's bankrupt-cy 
in December (GD 12/4). 
In releasing its earnings Thursday, Williams reported a 2001 net loss of $477.7 mil-lion, 
or 95?/share, compared with net earnings of $524.3 million or $1.17/share in 2000. 
The 2001 loss includes pre-tax charges of $2.05 billion relating to WGC. 
WGC said income from continuing operations for 2001 was $835.4 million, compared 
with $965.4 million a year earlier. The total WCG-related charges of $2.05 billion repre-sents 
80% of the total WCG-related guarantees and payment obligations, and the deferred 
payment for services provided to WCG, Williams said. 
Also Thursday, Williams said it will raise $275 million through the sale of 9.875% cumu-lative 
convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy 
Holdings. MEHC will acquire 1.46 million shares of the security at a price of $187.50/share, 
with each share of the security convertible into 10 shares of Williams' stock. The deal is expect-ed 
to close by March 31 and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction. 
MidAmerican, headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, is a privately owned energy 
provider with 10,000 employees. It provides gas and power to approximately 5 million 
customers.

I purchased an XTM Outlaw for my son for Xmas.  I need replacement front suspension arms (that the long pin goes thru) and my local dealer doesn't have the parts in stock.  How do I get the replacements?

Subject:	Maximum Hourly Flow

To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.

Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:

1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440

So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.

Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.

Spoke with Jim Adams at Panda this p.m.  His new guy Steve Curley is now on board working transportation for Panda.  Jim and Steve will likely call us Tues pm or Wed with a short list of questions on the project.  Jim is also waiting on feedback from TECO on our proposal.

if heat exhaust is counted in the "renewable" category, this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at TW compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates.  We are looking at one of these opportunties at TW station 1.

Kevin,

FYI--The New Mexico PRC has issued a proposed Renewable Energy Rule which would require providers of electricity to increase the percentage of their portfolio of energy supply from renewable sources.  Please review and let me know if this is something you feel we need to comment on.  My opinion would be that even if it impacted our business, it would be hard to argue against renewable sources of energy.  Below is the link to the proposed rule.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Glen

Subject:	Stranger things have happened...
Importance:	High

OK, for the Husker fans out there, in a time when I know you need a boost in morale after the fiasco in Boulder Saturday...

Check this out...   

First, below is the current Bowl Championship Standings for this week...

http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html

Talk about respect for Nebraska.  Even after a 62-36 shellacking, they only fell to #4 in the BCS standings.  Below are the possibilities for each team in the top 6...

http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/1119/1280619.html

So, you would think that would mean...   if two of the teams ahead of you lose this weekend, you guys would be in the championship game.  By comparison, Texas needs both Miami and Florida to lose to make it to the game, because of strength of schedule, quality wins, etc.  

So, let's take that theory one step further...

1)  If both Miami and Florida lose you would think that would pit Nebraska and Texas against each other in the Rose Bowl.  Wow, a Big 12 National Championship!

2)  Texas still has to beat Colorado.  If Texas loses and one of the two top teams loses, it would seem like you guys are in as well.

But you know the computers will come up with some cockemamy calculation that won't make any sense.

In closing, consider the following facts regarding this weekend's games...

Miami could lose their last game away at dangerous Va. Tech.  A win over the 'Canes would make the season for the Hokies (see Oklahoma State).  Remember that Va. Tech was a top 5 team at one point this year and they are playing at home.   Also...  Miami has lost 5 out of the last 6 to Va. Tech!
Florida could lose to Tennessee -or- if they beat the 'Vols, they could lose to what appears will be a very dangerous LSU team in the SEC championship.
On the flip side - Tennessee could lose to Florida -or- if they beat the Gators, could end up against that same LSU team.
Lastly, there is the Jekyl & Hide longhorns playing against the Jekyl & Hide buffalos.

Hey...   stranger things have happened.  The possibilities are endless, as they say at 1400 Smith (at least for now).  Of course, that may be a dangerous correlation.

Mark

Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.

Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  

Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.

If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.

Subject:	TW lateral pipe sale

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

thanks Blair, we've been following the FR debate very closely.

Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contrac=
ts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the o=
riginal 1996 El Paso settlement.  The indicated shippers last year did file=
 a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selli=
ng its capacity.  This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in get=
ting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project.

Subject:=09El Paso Full Requirements Customers


You may know this, but I thought I'd pass it on since it was mostly new to =
me.

El Paso has two types of firm customers, which are CD (contract demand) and=
 FR (full requirements) customers. FR customers are allowed to schedule an =
amount up to their full meter capacity as long as capacity is available. Ho=
wever, FR customers pay El Paso a fixed reservation charge and  volumes exc=
eeding FR quantities are billed El Paso's usage rate. FR customer loads hav=
e increased rapidly in the last few years as growth in the states east of C=
alifornia has surged. With these increased loads the FR customers have been=
 getting a tremendous deal since they pay only the usage charge on incremen=
tal volumes exceeding their FR quantities. FR customers argue that they are=
 entitled to this benefit since they bargained for it in EL Paso's last rat=
e proceeding. El Paso's last settlement was similar to TW's in that custome=
rs agreed to certain benefits in exchange for paying higher rates to resolv=
e capacity turnback issues. The FR customer's good deal is a problem becaus=
e 1) FR customer's increased volumes have led to capacity prorations making=
 it more difficult for other shippers to get cheaper San Juan gas, 2) these=
 prorations in conjunction with the scheduling cycles make it difficult for=
 shippers to get scheduled, 3) El Paso has no financial incentive to expand=
 because the FR customers will use the capacity and pay only the usage rate=
, and 4) the FR customers ability to take gas has prevented El Paso from of=
fering services such as park and loan and storage service that other custom=
ers want. Absent FERC action, FR customers will retain the benefits of the =
settlement until El Paso's next rate case in 2006.

The Commission is threatening to initiate a Section 5 proceeding to address=
 capacity allocation issues on El Paso and has directed Staff to convene a =
technical conference next month to address these issues (see March 18, 2002=
 Inside FERC).  The conference probably won't occur until at least late Apr=
il because El Paso is bogged down in their market abuse proceeding.

You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market


Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila


Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

Subject:	El Paso Capacity Allocation


FERC has announced a technical conference for discusssion of allocation issues on El Paso's system for April 16, 2002.
Click below for the notice:

http://cips.ferc.gov/Q/CIPS/GAS/RP/RP00-336.002.TXT

At the public meeting on March 13, staff made a presentation, recommending that El Paso convert Full Requirements shippers to Contract Demand; provide capacity rights of the greater of billing determinant or coincidental peak; maintain the existing rate structure; maintain the 1996 settlement; and accept El Paso's proposed 20 pooling areas up from the existing 3 areas. Staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is unreliable and recommended the Commission set a technical conference. 


Staff's presentation is attached:

Thank you, Kevin.

Attached please find further information on the Starline Technology. I have
seen this process in action and believe it to be a great tool for
rehabilitating gas mains and services. 

As discussed, I have included contact information for our Director of this
technology, Ted Fiala. You will find it in the PowerPoint presentation. 

If chosen to speak, we would be more than happy to work on developing a
presentation based on our experiences with major utility players and perhaps
be able to bring them along to discuss the technology as well.

Thank you very much for reviewing the information and I look forward to
hearing from you.

We need to add a "pressure guarantee" as a condition of service.  This has been discussed with both PW and Panda and needs to be explicit in the term sheet.

I'm checking that out now.  Western Gas, Sid Richardson, and Duke have all looked at it before.

I'm out of town on Wednesday.  I'd like to see the economics and risks outlined before this getting too far down the road with Pioneer.  Are there any other prospective buyers?

Subject:	TW lateral pipe sale

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

Kevin,

How are you doing? Hope things are going well for you.
As for myself, I might have to go back home to
Indonesia in a short time. I have not decided the time
yet, but I'll let you know what is the definite time.

I was wondering if you might have time for a lunch
next week. Let me know if you are available. Thanks.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.  As for item 6, I may have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.

thanks again,

Kevin, we have not yet had the opportunity to meet as I have not been able to
make it to the Committee meetings as Carrie had set-up. Taking a look at the
Agenda, I can probably help with items 5 or 6 and would be happy to develop and
deliver a presentation or would ensure that a senior representative from
Enbridge would do that. My natural tendency (with my current position in
Northern Pipeline Development) would be towards the Agenda Item No. 5 (New
Supply  Sources), but I probably could find a good resource within Enbridge to
present some views and thinking on the Infrastructure De-bottlenecking item.

Please let me know what you think............ wayne

I look forward to the Conference and to getting a chance to meet you.

Hi everyone!!

           For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin
Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.
You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an
interest in serving on the committee.

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4
sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were
developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee
members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15
(highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the
comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we
are trying to present for the conference attendees.

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only
confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the
agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the
topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should
last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.
Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair
Group confirming their attendance.

Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or
Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!

What would be the pressure if we don't install stations 1.5 and Kingman?  My thinking is we might not have enough market at Cal Border to require those stations.

Kevin,

That is the scenario where we installed all 36" pipe and added two new stations (Station #1.5 & Kingman).  The pressure to Panda will be greater than 600 psig.  The lateral is off the discharge of Station #1.5 which keeps the pressure profile up.  Looking at a minimum of 750 psig with and upside of 900 psig.  Hope this helps.

Ron, 
	can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.

thanks
