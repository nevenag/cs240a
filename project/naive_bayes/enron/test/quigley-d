Subject:	ENA Q4 Settlement

Dutch,

I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Finance in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?

Thanks,
Ben

well e-mailing to be exact and we were planning to hopefully play some golf this weekend.  we were thinking of maybe hitting something along the lines of maybe tricky dick's part of town (baytown).  if anyone has interest or other options e-mail back, also if you can what day.  we thought about baytown because it's probably as expensive as brock but a different locale.  
 
i love losing other people's money for a living!!!!

How was the early workout?
I called the plumbing guys- it's all warranty work
and they are getting with the Perry Homes people
to schedule to come fix it..I guess I should just have
called Perry directly and then they set up the times..
I'll know next time

Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=
 building and are currently parking in the Allen Center garage are being of=
fered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
 new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =
to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not b=
e opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street=
 level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is avail=
able. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be us=
ed as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=
 Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.=20

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have=
 to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Sarah , 

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 3      (572)
Cal 4      1921
Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)
Cal 7      (454)
Cal 8         96

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Thanks,

 Kevin,

There have been several things change as of late in my life.
One ,  we are not buying a townhouse anymore, we still have to sell our lot.
Kay is going to stay at a townhouse near downtown and as of today i am looking for an apartment.
I came to the realization that I got way off track , as I usually do , with the plan of both of us
getting a place on our own for six months and going from there. I can not tell you how grateful I 
have been for the support both you and Nancy have given me during this time in my life.
I know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan.
Is it ok for me to be at your house on and off for the next couple of weeks as i get an apartment set up ?
I will be working on renting a place that starts the 1st of the month.

Let me know

dq

Checked on CA flights- I know you are busy so just respond when you can and i will take care of this - it needs to be ticketed today
Which option works best for you: LAX was too expensive

1- Leave 8/31 at 5:30pm arrive Orange County 6:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm 
Total price $331.50 per person

OR
2- Leave 8/31 at 8:40pm arrive Orange County 9:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm
Total Price $243.50 per person

PS
No need to use up miles for this since tickets are not very pricey- would rather
save those 80k miles to go to a more expensive destination

Subject: Assistance for Former Employees



Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees.

CAREER SERVICES 
Last December Enron established a website to assist former employees identify jobs in Houston and throughout the United States.  Only former Enron employees and potential employers can access the site, <http://careerservices.enron.com/>

On this site, former employees can: 
        ? Post their resumes for approved employers to view 
        ? View job postings 
        ? Receive updates and information on career and community services available to them 
As of January 25, 2002: 
        ? More than 1,300 companies had been approved to view resumes 
        ? Company recruiters had logged on more than 3,500 times to search for candidates 
        ? More than 600 jobs had been posted on the site 

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 
The Greater Houston Community Foundation 
The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.   If you are interested in making a tax-deductible donation to the GHCF, please call 713-268-6458 or mail donations to GHCF at 4550 Post Oak Place, Suite 317, Houston, TX  77027.

Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account 
A former employee has established the Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account at the Humble Community Bank.  Visit the website at <<http://www.eerfa.com>> for more information or to make a donation.  Former employees can submit grant requests to eerfarequest@surfmk.com.

MDPC Transitional Assistance Program 
Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church has created a Transitional Assistance Program open to both members and non-members who need assistance re-entering the workforce.

Revised tailgating for Texas game.  Our grass  spot is by Cougar Den/Place (whatever the hell it is called).  If you are  walking toward the side of the stadium by our seats, you can't miss it.  We  will have a red canopy.  Plan on getting there around 4pm.  Call if  you have any questions.

Subject:	Hello from UT

Hola,

If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home
mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already.

Well, we I made it safely to UT.  We made the drive in about 2 days getting
to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning.  Now I am
reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive
cross country.  The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in
NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper.  The
2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was
harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while
oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept.  Those are
just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and
seeing the country.

I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to
John's delight none of them will be gracing a "Gorgeous Hunks of Park City
Utah" calendar anytime soon.  It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've
been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town.
I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my
skiing and boarding activities will be free.  I am scheduled to start this
thurs at the bakery.  I'm considering picking up another part time job just
to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr
schedule first.

I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to say hello and most
importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in
touch.

Sno-mo

All right folks, this is the last note I'm sending about this stuff.
The word is out...the league is active with people joining every day.
 Week 1 is finally here so get your picks in after you sign up.  You
can make adjustments to your picks until one hour before the first

is the link that you need to get started....

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:  kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list.
If you don't see your name, select "New Player" and click Submit.

Thanks to all the good folks who have already signed up (and paid the
entry fee! ($100)).  If you know people who may be interested in
joining, please let them know.  If you are not interested in playing,
ignore this message and have a nice day.

Questions?  Send me an email...

OUT.

Kay,

 

Thanks for your message - don't worry - according to the leukemia info, jackie will be in and out of the hospital many times over the next two years - most of the time it will be routine trips for chemo (4 to 8 hour visits) and getting rid of infections (up to 1 week visits) - if it ever looks serious, i'll let you know. Thanks for thinking about us and especially my little Jack.

 

Robert

Hi Dutch,
 
No, all he said was that he hadn't been given instructions as of yet (7:50).  I've just called him again (9:05), and he said that he was told that there would be no money transfered either way???
 
Thanks!

One of the questions posed in Don?t Sweat the Small Stuff is, ?Will this
matter a year fromnow?? Some things will, of course. But so many
others--perhaps most things---won?t. There is something very comforting in
knowing this. When the computer crashes, the keys are misplaced, the house
is a mess or the call isn?t returned, it is annoying, but it?s not the end
the world.

   Subject:  Questions regarding storage

   Hi there Dutch!

   How are you? Hope you're doing well.

   We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
   framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
   questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
   description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

   1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
   understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
   future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What
   is
   actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
   How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

   2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and
   then
   select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our
   other
   scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
   risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
   appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
   cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by
   storage
   decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
   thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then
   would
   the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

   Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

   Ann

Kay,

 

Thanks for your message - don't worry - according to the leukemia info, jackie will be in and out of the hospital many times over the next two years - most of the time it will be routine trips for chemo (4 to 8 hour visits) and getting rid of infections (up to 1 week visits) - if it ever looks serious, i'll let you know. Thanks for thinking about us and especially my little Jack.

 

Robert

Subject:	NFL Pick'em

This is an invitation for you to join the best NFL office pool since
well, last year's pool.  During the off-season, a secret vote was
apparently held to designate me as the commissioner for this year's
league.  Well let's do it...

General Q&A about this league to help you realize you should sign up
and play (for those of you who have not played before):

Q1.  How much does this cost me?
A1.  Ah yes, the most important question.  It costs $100 per player.
The money is due to me by Sunday, September 9.  You don't pay...you
don't play!  Get your fee to me in person or mail it to the following
address:

Brian Dunlavy
8073 El Mundo
Houston, TX 77054


Q2.  What is this?
A2.  It's an NFL office pool.  Each week, you will select the winners
of the NFL games straight up and assign a ranking of 15 to 1 for the
games (or 14, 13 if teams are off).  Your 15 game is your most
confident game while your 1 game is the game that you just can't
figure out.  If your team wins, then you get the number of points you
designated to that team.  For example, New York Giants vs. Cleveland
Browns.  You select New York to win and rank them with 15.  They win,
you get 15 points.  They lose, you don't get any points.

Q3.  Why are the rankings for the games important?
A3.  Because that is how you win money!  Each week, the individual
with the highest score wins the weekly money which will be $50.  A
running total of the scores is kept for the season and the rest of
the money will be paid to first through fifth place (possibly sixth
place).

Q4.  How do I enter and play?
A4.  The league name is "H-Town Slaps".  You can access the site at
any time using the web address:

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

NOTE: Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:

kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list. If
you don't see your name, select "New Player" and click Submit.

Read over the rules for the league for further information.  If you
have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Good Luck!  Also, I don't have everyone's email addresses (especially
those who have played in the past) so please forward this email to
your friends who may be interested in playing.

Thanks,
Brian

jody and the former 'less than zero star' are in...and i'm sure
rick, grant, dan, bj, & currie would back me on any vote for newcomer!
we also have to pick the place...either ENRON field or jody's place?
i'll be marathon training that morning so i'll be rushing to whichever
location we choose.  i'm cool with the spotswig residence if he's
offering.
5 votes for jody....who else is out there?

O.K...O.K...After all these years (Rick would definitely get a kick out of
this), I guess I'm in.  It was much more fun to sit back and laugh at Ty and
Dan each week though.  I'm sure I'll pay for that now.

Ty, if you can get John Sz. on board, he and I can put together a team this
year if you're still looking to fill a spot.  I need John for sure though.

I'll throw my house in the hat as well for a possible location to do the
draft.

We're 5 min. up from HWY 249 (by Willowbrook mall and the horse track), or
about 15min. from 45N/Beltway, or about 15min. from 290W/Beltway.

You make the call.....

September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house
(pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
be more centrally located?
jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the black
eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller -C
 URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
opportunity.

jody,
once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise players....
when we draw numbers for the 1st "official" round they pick at the bottom
because they have the best players in hand.

sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.  the
cost
is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in town
and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
desire for the following year.

Malone has officially kicked Stockton off the team...therefore, I will be
jumping to the weak ASS north (A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME) to join Malone
(although our name will change) and leave my Southern team in the capable
hands of my co-owner Jeff.  Dutch has said that he will be back.  Thus, that
is 3 teams spoken for.

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

Michael

I sent an E-mail to Deluke and others and was told that the agreed upon date
was Sept 8...mainly due to the previous weekend being Labor Day.  I would
prefer our usual start time around 11 or 12.  I have somewhere else to be
around 5pm or so.  We also agreed to divulge franchise players and determine
draft order the day of the draft.  If anyone has issues...then speak now.

i am not having a good morning
i have to re-execute my contract from last week
because we (in my rush I emailed it to legal wrong) had the price in it wrong- too many zeros
so it looks like they can buy power for practically nil
no one caught the error before customer signed it
so it really sucks that I have to get him to resign

I was forwarded the message you left for Joe Hunter regarding the Chase situation.  I have contacted legal to discuss Enron generating the confirmations for EOL deals.  Was it Greg Crowley at Chase that you spoke with regarding this?  I just need to give Mark Taylor the right name.  

Also, FYI, Joe is longer with the confirms group. Going forward, I can help you with any issues you have regarding financial confirms.  

Thanks,

TAGG no: VW1398.1 
EOL no: 1707177

15,000 a day (465,000 for month of October)

We signed in error their confirmation showing 450,000 per month, but they legally agreed to 465,000 by clicking on the EOL trade.

Sorry that error slipped through.
Let me know.

Subject:=09MDA Celebrity Waiters

Hi everyone,
I am the Co-Chair for the Muscular Dystrophy Association's Celebrity Waiter=
 Benefit this year.  I know I have spoke to several of you about this event=
, and for everyone else, I thought you might be interested so I decided to =
send an email with the details.  This benefit raises funds to extend resear=
ch and patient services to over 1350 families that are affected by a neurom=
uscular disorder in the Houston Gulf Coast area.

The date is Saturday, October 6, 2001 at the Houston Club downtown (6:30 pm=
 - 12 am; dinner is served at 8 pm).  Local celebrities, such as TV anchors=
, radio DJs, former oilers, local business owners, etc. wait tables to rais=
e money.  There is a silent and live auction, as well as dinner, dancing an=
d a casino.  The cost is $75 per person and a table seats 10.  Black tie op=
tional.  Beer and wine will be included in the ticket price until 10 pm.   =
Silent and live auction items include autographed sports paraphernalia (Joe=
 Torre baseball signed at the 61* HBO premiere), Continental tickets, golf =
packages, autographed CD package, autographed book collection, theater tick=
ets, spa packages, etc.  This my fourth year to help out with this event an=
d it is really a fun, lively benefit.=20

If you are interested, please let me know.  Also, please let me know if you=
 want to put together a table of 10 and the people who will be sitting at t=
hat table.  There are approximately 300 people that attend the event.
Rebecca

Honey, I have talked to maritza and she will come clean Thursday
Also - if you could follow up on the insurance claim I filed for the tree info is:
Allstate's South TX claim office ph#1-888-250-6605
The claim number is 8202536549 filed 8/31 on our homeowner's policy#216939226
I don't think they assigned an adjustor yet - they said someone from that claims
office would call us..

Good news bad news.   The course here in town would only take one tee time
without a credit card.  It is at 10:57  Yuk.  The really nice course that is
just as close to my house didn't have a time until 12:02  YUKKKK.  So I
called Anahuac and they had a 9:32 and a 9:40.  So I booked the 10:57 and the
two at 930.  The anahuac course is nice but it is another 15-20 min. from my
house.  If we need only one tee time we can go from my house in my car.  If
we have two then I'll drive and someone else will have to as well.  Let me
know how many people and so forth.   (Evergreen is about 40 dollars and
Anahuac is about 25.)

Hi Dutch,
 
No, all he said was that he hadn't been given instructions as of yet (7:50).  I've just called him again (9:05), and he said that he was told that there would be no money transfered either way???

Hi Dutch,
 
Yes, I would think this is possible because the overall margin excess is $24,296,123.00.  Unfortunately, I don't see any "breakdowns" on the numbers.
 
Hope this helps!

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!

Mojo,

that is sweet , pardon the pun
those cakes look great , what is in the casino cake ?
it looks pretty cool

How are things going for you ?
Have you settled into a groove yet ?

This past weekend was great for me.
I spent the entire weekend with Kay , 
we had dinner with my parents on sat. Night
and just hung out the entire weekend.
I have had a very different out look on life lately and
it has been working well for me. I have started to ask
alot more questions instead of always assuming the answer.
It has been working well for me.

Hope all is good with you.

Laters

Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

12 or 14 teams , 5 or 6 franchise players some one will always be complaining of unfair drafts
this is just a suggestion to chew on 
I still agree with the vote and in keeping with the rules of the league

There are 14 teams.
Even with Dutch's version, you will still have someone that kept the 5th
franchise player getting the 15th pick, while someone that did not keep a
franchise player, but had the first pick in the supplemental round getting
the 6th pick and the 28th pick.  I don't think that is fair.  We have always
voted on rules changes for the next year at the current years draft.  I
don't think we should make an exception now to the rule.

Eric,

John is comfortable with sending out a 5 year curve to Egypt
also he does not want to adjust the length of the forward price curve in the system due to non liquidity in the market that far forward

Dutch,

Per our conversation last week, can the gas price curve be extended out past 2024?  Also,  could you ask John about sending Egypt a historical forward curve.  They would like to see a couple of historical curves from the last 6 months out as far as we are willing to go.

I'll check back with you this afternoon. 

Thanks again.

Eric

Kirk,
As I am just catching up, I am not the one for storage and transportation issues as i do not trade them on a regular basis.
I was under the impression i was working on the options and futures. Yes there has not been any meeting with me for the past two weeks.  As for the conversion and arbitrage problems let me know , I am not sure what these are but am will to help.

Dutch
How are you today? I hope all is well.
I know you are extremely busy meeting our financial targets for Q4/01. In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means. So far so good, but the next step will be for the SME's to review the content for sign-off. Your timely work for review will be invaluable.  

However at today's Status meeting Accenture had the following in their status report:

	Issues for Management Attention
Dutch has not been able to meet with us for the past two weeks, nor has he responded to our e-mail requests for information. This means we are relying on Andy for all the detailed trader content, which includes the two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems. With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need. Proposed solution: ask Andy and/or Dutch to give us the name of another trader who can meet with us to answer our detailed questions.


My initial question to you: "Is this statement accurate?"

My next Questions: "What Can I do to assist you?"
			 "Can you name someone to provide the information requested (i.e. two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems.)

Here is what I have provided to Accenture to help complete your assignments and to provide content for your review:
	BRM Text book
	Derivatives I as a resource only
	The slides attached below
	Other course work as a resource only

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for all your assistance and I know how busy you are & how important your commercial duties are for the company. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.

Hi there Dutch!

How are you? Hope you're doing well.

We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What is
actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then
select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our other
scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage
decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then would
the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

Ann

Thanks Dutch.  I spoke with John Arnold yesterday and he said that we can assume that the deal verbally confirmed on Friday does not need to be done.  That is CSFB's position and unless you disagree we will leave it at that.

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

5 franchise teams and 7 non-franchise
franchise teams ranked 1 - 5 based on total points of franchise player from previous year

First the supplemental draft

Round one
# 5 franchise team, # 7 supplemental , # 4 franchise , # 6 supplemental and so forth and so on

with a non snake system going from there

Subject:	RE: Franchise Players and the Draft

The snake thing is good and bad.   But I think the first round should be
randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not
keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental
and then also at the top of the first round.   Theoretically the non keeper
teams are getting the 8-14 best players who are arguably also franchise
players.  In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a
lower level franchise player.  So they shouldn't get the an automatic shot
at 15-22 or whatever it might be as well.  So snake or no snake all of round
one should be random order.

Purvi,

Glad to see you working on some good stuff : )

you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles that you were given
and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the resonableness of the model
models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions

good luck

Subject:	i need your help....

I have this little project to do and i need a little help from you... (since you are an expert in this field!!)

ok-- i need to figure out what the premium is on an aug on- peak call option for power. Now , I know that power is not what you do, but I can use some ideas on how to get started.

Terms

Strike price  is $200/ MWH
Forward curve for Aug is $125/MWH
Aug 2001
Foward Volatility of 100%
Valuation Date is June 8, 2001
Interest Rate is 6%
On- Peak Call Option for 50 MW

SO far, I have looked at some forcasts for Aug, and seen which hours the market rate is above 200 to come up with a premium value.  I have an answer for this problem, but I was just curous as to see where you would start. Anything will work. Thanks!!

Purvi

P.S-- also, don't be hesitant to tell me that you have no clue--- You'll still be my favorite manager!!!

Take a look at this site

I thought that Section B would be good

FINAL
E.10
(Copyright 2001)

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

if there are 5 franchise players then the order should be supplemental 1 through say 7

round one should go supplemental teams  7 to 1 then franchise teams in reverse order
of how they ranked the previous year

round 2 through what ever is the same as the other draft we did

Dutch,

Can you please tell me the conversion of nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or bbl.  For example, if nat gas is 4.891/mmbtu for May, how does it convert to $/gal or bbl?

Thanks for your help.  I appreciate your time.

Can you please tell me the conversion factor for nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or price per bbl?  Can you please give me a short example because the conversion I see is 5.825 (mmbtu to bbls).

Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch

Please read the message below (from Mark).  He asked about it, I looked it
up and got us a tee time.  If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere
else, that is fine with me.  Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee
times in Kingwood.

With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood
is a happy medium.  We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
Who the hell lives by Brock?  I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is
better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.

I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.  It's
golf!!!!

Dutch,
I just want to follow up on this email that I sent you.
We are getting very close to losing our database access to the EOL database.  I don't have the exact date at this point.  The word we got from EOL is very soon.

If it's very critical for you to continue to run your excel model, you may want to contact someone at the EOL.

Please let us know either way.

Thanks,
Franky

Subject:	RE: EOL Database

Dutch,

We have created a table in our SQL Server database which is almost similar to the one in the EOL Database. 
This new table is populated at realtime from the Tibco Data Feed.

After evaluating your existing eol_macro.xsl query, we discovered that we can not fully preserve the functionality of your model due to the missing REFERENCE_PERIOD_END_DTM field.  This field is used in your macro for grouping and sorting purposes.  We have requested this field to be added to the Tibco Data Feed but have encountered a road block, EOL is unwilling to add to this field at this time.

The next technology currently being developed by EOL will solve this problem but is not available until November.

As soon as EOL-IT shuts off access to the EOL database, your macro will no longer work.  
We anticipate that this is going to happen in the next month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Franky

If these problems are not being addressed as they should be, call me and I'll get on it.  This is unacceptable.

Subject: Back office issues



Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out" 
"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade" 
"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for" 
"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type" 
"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said "they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the "backoffice"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

Hello Dutch.

Hope you are having a good Monday. I've delayed this message in hopes that
you catch up with the last three weeks' assignments that you have not
handed in yet. As I noted in our discussion last week, it will be
signficantly helpful to Monica and I to receive any information you've
gathered to this point, as opposed to receiving it all at the end.

As usual, I've included the high-level outline for each content area that
you should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember, this
assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!

   Costs involved with a futures contract
     Margin as a guarantee of contract
   Closing out a futures position
     Make or take delivery
     Reverse futures position (i.e. liquidate position)

the major different types of options.>>
   Physical vs. Financial
   Asian, European and American
   Swaption
   Dutch, you may want to mention that many other types of options exist

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project

assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

I understand that you have been talking to the EOL people about being able to pull information from the databases
I have talked to Franky about upgrading the macro we use but would like to talk to you about other options that there
might be. Swing by when you have a minute to talk

Dutch,
I just want to follow up on this email that I sent you.
We are getting very close to losing our database access to the EOL database.  I don't have the exact date at this point.  The word we got from EOL is very soon.

If it's very critical for you to continue to run your excel model, you may want to contact someone at the EOL.

Please let us know either way.

Thanks,
Franky

Subject:	RE: EOL Database

Dutch,

We have created a table in our SQL Server database which is almost similar to the one in the EOL Database. 
This new table is populated at realtime from the Tibco Data Feed.

After evaluating your existing eol_macro.xsl query, we discovered that we can not fully preserve the functionality of your model due to the missing REFERENCE_PERIOD_END_DTM field.  This field is used in your macro for grouping and sorting purposes.  We have requested this field to be added to the Tibco Data Feed but have encountered a road block, EOL is unwilling to add to this field at this time.

The next technology currently being developed by EOL will solve this problem but is not available until November.

As soon as EOL-IT shuts off access to the EOL database, your macro will no longer work.  
We anticipate that this is going to happen in the next month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Franky

It was so bad Richard got in a fight with a die-hard cougar fan that sits in front of us.  Do you know anyone that might want to buy my Texas tickets.

i'm sure you guys probably know, but we get to see dough-boy at qb
this weekend.  nick eddy will start in place of kelly robertson.
we'll have a qb with a manly name, and if he sucks we could put
him in at defensive live (he weighs 260 lbs.)

Here are the directions to Enron.  Call Dutch's cell number if you get lost,
confused, or whatever.  Draft starts at 11am.  Please let us know if you
find anyone that wants to join the league!!!  I also need a list of names if
you are bringing a friend that we can leave with the guard, otherwise I will
just leave the names of the various owners.

Later,

2. For my left line I need a shoulder rest & a mount put under my desk
3. I need a tray that will mount on to the divider of the desk

Hi Denise, Kay, and Dutch, 
i thought i'd say hi before i logged off - 12:42 am.  Amanda has been home sick the past two days and i have been rescheduling appts and putting away christmas decorations. she is doing better and will head to school tomorrow.   
Denise i hope you are taking care of yourself. 
Kay and Dutch - thanks for sending your address, the kids are in the process of writing holiday thank you's.  Any chance you could send or email a picture of the puppy Rex, they would love it and me too. 
Kevin and Jo came for dinner last friday and kevin loaded some cool picture scanning software - hopefully i'll get some photos out this year on the web. 
Life is going good here - i am going to the  annual mardi gras committee meetings and setting boundaries and have NOT volunteered to head a committee. I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.   
Hugs and love to each of you, 
Michele 
PS Hey mom thought you'd enjoy reading this too.

Good morning to my sweet honey..
Hope your day goes well...I really hope
that I did not come across as insensitive in our 
discussion to try to get the townhouse back in the
event we get a contract on our lot, I just want what is best
given the levels of stress we deal with day in and day out
So- I would like to talk further about it- because if it makes sense
to try and keep going on that new construction then maybe we should- I guess we would
have "down time" while it was being built... just hope the lead on our
lot comes through.
love you

Dutch's suggestion would alleviate all of Kevin's points below.  Whether we
snake after that is another issue - the top three rounds are more important
than the back to back pick issue.

This is the same deal Russell has been pricing up with you.  It is a big VPP with Hilcorp and Lehman is recommending they proceed with Enron and we plan on meeting on Monday.

So, can I get a refresh BID on the following....

Subject:	RE:

Alright, I'll throw my two cents in.  Dutch is right, Ricky is right, Ernie is right, as is Kevin and everyone else who responded.  We are an extremely fortunate bunch.  We tend to be extraordinarily resilient and forgiving.  I took a bunch of flak over the past three years for my frequent absences, however, they were not absences because of a flippant attitude.  Law school took its toll as did accommodating Jo's set of friends.  My time had to be split many ways and it can be difficult to juggle everything as I am sure you are all aware.  But, mind you, I was not absent because I didn't care, or found something better to do.  It was never because I didn't want to.  At the risk of this becoming even more of a love in, you guys should know, as this is apparently the only opportunity we've taken, you are my friends.  And I would like to keep it that way.  I have to go now.  Mark says that that the keyboard placement blocks his access to my balls.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

Dutch,

I was wondering if you could have the price curve that is loaded into the system extended out through 2030.  It ends in 2024 right now, but some of the LNG deals that we are looking at are longer than that.  We use it for VERY indicative purposes only and would talk with you and John if any serious numbers were needed.

If this is a problem or if I need to contact someone else, please let me know.

thanks,

Eric

the curve settled 3.57 for apr 02 to mar 05
the curve has an adjustment of 0.025 cents
and our offer is 0.125 cents over that
all in the offer is 3.72

I will get with john on Monday to confirm the 0.125 , I do not know if this fits into
his position so this number may change depending on his position and opinion of the market.

Dutch,

Attached is the quote sheet I mentioned earlier - we are submitting the indicative bid Tuesday, Aug. 28th, so I will be sure to check back with you Monday afternoon for a real-time number.  For now, a notional Offer-Mid spread would be helpful (to ensure our models do not explode when we include it...)  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.  Thanks!

well e-mailing to be exact and we were planning to hopefully play some golf this weekend.  we were thinking of maybe hitting something along the lines of maybe tricky dick's part of town (baytown).  if anyone has interest or other options e-mail back, also if you can what day.  we thought about baytown because it's probably as expensive as brock but a different locale.  
 
i love losing other people's money for a living!!!!

Hi Dutch,
 
I hated to call you to tell you I still don't have an answer from EDF Man.  I spoke to Paul again about 5 min. ago (1:45) and he tells me that he still can't get an answer but that I'm the first on the list to call!!??  I then called our treasury department and spoke to Nera and she says that the wire has not come in as of yet.
 
I'll let you know as soon as I do!

As you can see from Dutch's email, this report must be accurate. Please review and update in so that I can send a new email today. Thanks
Cheers

Team
We are doing much better with interviews (See below). Thanks & keep up the good work. Please complete assignments on time. In addition, we need each SME as a minimum to allot 4 hours a week towards this project, which will significantly increase the potential for the end product to "Exceed the Mark & Expectations."

Quote for this week: "One should always bloom, where one is planted."

Have a great weekend and I hope to see all of you on the Oct 24th Boat Ride.

Thanks for your great efforts thus far.

Cheers
Kirk

September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house (pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
be more centrally located?
jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the black
eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller -C
 URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
opportunity.

jody,
once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise players....
when we draw numbers for the 1st "official" round they pick at the bottom
because they have the best players in hand.

sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.  the cost
is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in town
and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
desire for the following year.


ty.servello@cs.oag.state.tx.us

>>> "Crawford, Kevin" <KevinCrawford@clearchannel.com> 08/10/01 04:36PM >>>
Malone has officially kicked Stockton off the team...therefore, I will be
jumping to the weak ASS north (A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME) to join Malone
(although our name will change) and leave my Southern team in the capable
hands of my co-owner Jeff.  Dutch has said that he will be back.  Thus, that
is 3 teams spoken for.

S & M RULES!!!

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

Michael

I sent an E-mail to Deluke and others and was told that the agreed upon date
was Sept 8...mainly due to the previous weekend being Labor Day.  I would
prefer our usual start time around 11 or 12.  I have somewhere else to be
around 5pm or so.  We also agreed to divulge franchise players and determine
draft order the day of the draft.  If anyone has issues...then speak now.

Later,

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Question 1:
When we talk about "the market" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
for each event we need to build a change matrix that will change the previous price curve to a new one
depending on each event it could change all parts of the sport and forward curve

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and "fake" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
Instead of a VaR number we could set position limits that they must stay within at all times
i.e. over all position can not be outside a set range , NYMEX Risk can not exceed +/- 500 contracts
Basis & Index Risk can not exceed +/- 1000 contracts so for and so on 
Therefore not having to calculate VaR and expect the user to understand what to do to stay with in limits




Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet
on Tuesday, if possible.

[Quigley, Dutch]  
can you check with your team , I am to meet with them on Monday and Tues. so see if you can squeeze into one of the times or we can make a new one

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

Kay,

Thanks for your call the other night.  I was at the hospital.  Jackie is
doing ok so far but today she has a big operation to put a tube in her chest
- a permanent replacement for the IV in her hand that the doctors say kids
like better since they don't see it under their shirts and get used to it
after a week or two.  75% chance to live at this point and if all goes as
planned there will be no need for a bone marrow transplant but she will need
blood transfusions...we don't need to donate at all as HK as a supply of
blood already...no visitors to her room except me, vicky, michelle, and
michelle's boyfriend...mom may have told you by now she has ALL Type B and I
got the info on Type B that you downloaded from the web - thanks - i am
still reading through all of the materials from the doctor - i do have alot
of questions - if you have a friend at MD Anderson i need to find out what
the "German Method" of treatment for leukemia is and whether it's  just as
good as the american method, and i also want to find out whether chinese
people can have the same treatment as westerners...i would think that at md
anderson they would have experience treating both chinese and western
patients so they should know if the treatments are normally the same or
not...i don't know if this hospital has ever had a western leukemia patient
before...thanks again.
Robert

I have not heard any major news on the ENE stock , we are all just watching it drop
most energy company stocks are in decline right now , wal street is bearish with 
energy stocks until california gets settled

Thanks for the info. I did do the Black Sholes exercise and got a different premium.  I'll have to research it more. Anyways, thanks again for your help.. by the way, what is going on with the stock price? I only have 10 more days to exercise!!!!!!!! aaaggghhhhh

Purvi


>>> <Dutch.Quigley@enron.com> 06/07/01 11:28AM >>>
Purvi,

Glad to see you working on some good stuff : )

you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles
that you were given
and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the
resonableness of the model
models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions

good luck

   I have this little project to do and i need a little help from you...
   (since you are an expert in this field!!)

   ok-- i need to figure out what the premium is on an aug on- peak call
   option for power. Now , I know that power is not what you do, but I can
   use some ideas on how to get started.

   Terms

   Strike price  is $200/ MWH
   Forward curve for Aug is $125/MWH
   Aug 2001
   Foward Volatility of 100%
   Valuation Date is June 8, 2001
   Interest Rate is 6%
   On- Peak Call Option for 50 MW

   SO far, I have looked at some forcasts for Aug, and seen which hours the
   market rate is above 200 to come up with a premium value.  I have an
   answer for this problem, but I was just curous as to see where you would
   start. Anything will work. Thanks!!

   Purvi

   P.S-- also, don't be hesitant to tell me that you have no clue--- You'll
   still be my favorite manager!!!

On 12/3/2001 we put in a swap for: ENA Sell 7/month @ 3.261.  This matches a PMG confirm they sent us for a trade done on the 30th.  I see a futures sale of 7 @ 3.2610 w/ Paribas.  Let me know if I've got the right trade, and I'll flip it.

I'll be back around 1pm.

This is the same volume I got a quote from you last week -EEX - Bobwest VPP unwind.

I need your offer on the indicated volume.

Please provide the quote as of Friday night's close (not a current quote).  I think last time you said just use $.02 above mid.

OK ladies and gentlemen.  It has been quite a while since we had a Houston area Sammy Happy Hour, but I thought that we should do one again.  If you received this e-mail in error, or don't want to receive this type of e-mail, then just reply and I will take you out of my address book.  It needs updating as I have duplicate e-mails for some of you guys and gals.  I am thinking the 17th, 18th, or 19th.  I will make a tally of which day is best, so please reply.  If you don't reply, then I will assume that any of those days is good for you and make an executive decision.  Also, once we nail down a date, please pass this info along to anyone who might wish to come.  I know some of you guys don't live in town, or even in TX for that matter, but I just wanted to let you know what was going on.  Actives from SFA who might be in town that week are invited as well.  I look forward to hearing from all of you.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 3      (572)
Cal 4      1921
Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)
Cal 7      (454)
Cal 8         96

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Thanks,

okay - here's what i know -- we are trying to hire some of the best

people out there at whatever they may do -- one position that we are

looking at is kinda what you are already doing -- our nymex trader is

bob shiring -- take that however you wish -- but that's who you  would

be working directly with so that's who you would need to talk to.  i

know this position is in the budget for this year but i'm not sure what

the time frame is.  bob's email is bob.shiring@rweamericas.com -- you

can tell him that you got his name from me and then i'm sure he'll

approach me about it -- that is, of course, if you are interested and to

the extent that you do not have any contractual issues in talking to us.

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.

Subject: Back office issues



Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out" 
"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade" 
"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for" 
"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type" 
"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said "they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the "backoffice"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

so we will get together as needed to handle these concerns.

Subject:	RE: EDF Man

EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.

Sarah , 

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Hopefully everyone got their invitation to her party and now you can all
throw them away.  If you were coming to the party it has been cancelled b/c
Michaela is very sick.  Carrie took off today to take her to the doctor with
my mom and I'm not sure how she will be feeling by this weekend.  So we
think the best thing to do is just cancel and she just wont get any cake.
We are a little worried about her so say a prayer and hopefully all will be
okay.

Richard

Due to performance issues with our plasma screens we have restricted access to the EOL feeds to the plasma machines themselves.
You can however still access the NYMEX strip on the right utilizing the following links.  If you know anyone else who has need

Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Was really hoping to hear from you by this morning.  After what we saw on CNN  last night I want to know that you both are okay  - haven't traveled - and all of your friends are okay too!
We're only getting bits and pieces of news and it's  so shocking.
I want to hear from you now even if it's just one  line!
Love MOM

Kevin,

There have been several things change as of late in my life.
One ,  we are not buying a townhouse anymore, we still have to sell our lot.
Kay is going to stay at a townhouse near downtown and as of today i am looking for an apartment.
I came to the realization that I got way off track , as I usually do , with the plan of both of us
getting a place on our own for six months and going from there. I can not tell you how grateful I 
have been for the support both you and Nancy have given me during this time in my life.
I know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan.
Is it ok for me to be at your house on and off for the next couple of weeks as i get an apartment set up ?
I will be working on renting a place that starts the 1st of the month.

Let me know

Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Wave is fair but stalling, it had trouble going through 3.30 in auggie but on the nws and api news it broke
other levels are 4.00 in winter and 3.90 in cal 2. My opinion is that it will take a low aga or weather
to push through all three of these resistant levels at one time. Cal 2 was 3.90 bid this morning and then came back off to 3.875 along with winter being 4.01 bid and falling with it. This has happened several times already.
 
Let me know if you need anything else

I get it directly from Accenture. See below the email from Laura. Contact her ASAP and get your information corrected. I will personally send out a correction. This is meant to be a status update not a report per se.

As you can see from Dutch's email, this report must be accurate. Please review and update in so that I can send a new email today. Thanks

We are doing much better with interviews (See below). Thanks & keep up the good work. Please complete assignments on time. In addition, we need each SME as a minimum to allot 4 hours a week towards this project, which will significantly increase the potential for the end product to "Exceed the Mark & Expectations."

Quote for this week: "One should always bloom, where one is planted."

Have a great weekend and I hope to see all of you on the Oct 24th Boat Ride.

Thanks for your great efforts thus far.

Cheers
Kirk

Just so you don't double up and call Continental - i went ahead and called
to get our new itenerary- we still leave on a nonstop Friday 11/16 departing 9:50pm and get there at 10:55p
On the return- they had us leaving at 6:40 on 11/20 going thru Phoenix and arriving home at 1am
I changed it to leaving Vegas at 4pm nonstop flight to home and arrive here 9pm (this cut 1 hour 20 min off travel time)
hope that is okay

Yes that time has come upon us again - fantasy football for the 2001 season.
I'm sure I echo everyone's feelings about the loss of Rick Pearce.  It's
been a tough summer because of it.  Since Rick took care of much of the
Commissioner's duties the past few years, we are in a void.  That being
said, I want to start this process of keeping our league intact.  Please
respond as quickly as possible and let me know your intentions as far as

(1) playing in the league
(2) preference for a draft date (September 1 which is Labor Day Weekend, or
September 9)
(3) anyone you know who might be interested in joining the league.



Thanks

It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66 

        INCOMING 

                ABN Amro                                $33,852.00 
                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00 
                HSBC                                    $291,325.00 
                HSBC Canada                             No Margin Call 
                R. J. Obrien                            $12,320.00 
                J.P. Morgan                             $292,827.00 
                Credit Suisse                           $200,261.00 
                

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.

Mr. Quigley,

I am predicting the worst knowing that we could possibly be running late. So
I have two questions. First, what will be the cost per square (minimum
purchase)? And would you like for me to bring some pico de gallo?

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

Dutch,

I need to get your indicative OFFER to unwind a portion of the Andex VPP (the small one we closed in August).

Team
Here are my comments on Options (See attachment below).

We need examples of:
Cap (Call Option)
Floor
Collar

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.

I would still like to play golf this weekend b/c it is the friendship that is fun
I might even take on Ernesto for the Brock dog challenge

It is truly sick what happened , I was talking to a broker that was in the second world trade tower as it got
hit and he was describing what was going on.  Several people I know made it out of both buildings but many are not 
yet accounted for , so at this time all there is is hope.

May everyone have a peaceful day

Dutch

Subject:=09Reduction of trading lines by Fimat

Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=
d may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=
e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09


On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =
NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=
 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=
lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=
e bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=
ollowing events according to Steve:

Thursday 10/25
ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=
sting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=
s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=
sociated with the moving of the trades.=20
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=
 agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =
them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=
ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=
 on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =
price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=
 on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=
ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=
10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =
Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =
send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=
 behalf of Enron. =20
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =
million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=
en margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=
t wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=
=20
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=
imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=
r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=
e undisclosed. =20
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=
ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=
ight now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=
ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=
 with these events. =20

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =
the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=
red to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =
it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=
ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =
in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=
 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=
ement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=
e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=
scomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=
dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=
ts on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =
press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=
at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=
argin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=
 the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=
 responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=
ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=
e payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=
en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=
ne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=
ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=
ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=
tice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=
 we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =
an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=
 but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=
rly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20

We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=
o entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=
r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=
t now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=
 we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=
y.  Let's decide what to do and implement.

Hi David , 

At this time I do not know of a rotation on the NYMEX desk.
Both Justin and myself are both Associates currently on the desk that will not be rotating
for some time now.

Hi Dutch:

Do you know if your group may be looking as my rotation ends 11/30?

Thanks

Hi,

I enjoyed working with you during my prior assignment at Enron as the primary person managing the Nymex natural gas positions
and serving as a liaison between your Nymex trading activity and numerous brokers.

Additionally, I am currently seeking a new assignment as an analyst as my rotation date is approaching and am interested
in knowing of any positions available in your group. I do know Brian who formerly worked in your group as an analyst.

I am extremely interested in meeting with you to review my background after trading hours.

Thanks,
David

Yes - told the rug guy to make it around 6:45p- I have a call that might keep me at work until 6pm
FYI- talked to our insurance (health) about all the claims we have been paying in full for services
and they will reimburse us 50% of reasonable and customary charges even though he is out of network
so that is good news- I have just mailed them my last visits- please keep your receipts thanks
