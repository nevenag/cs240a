Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Tucker Patrick McCaffrey Deirdre Penman Gregg Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 1114 Here are my notes from todays call  As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets  Core Non-core and Under Review Core  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Non-core  Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS  Enron has approx 8Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review  EGM EIM  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability  Required resource levels are being carefully studied  Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates Approximately 800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter  These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of 500MM-1Bn  Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Short-term liquidity is provided by the 3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the 1Bn of new debt and the 15Bn equity infusion from Dynegy  Longer-term the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets  It was initially capitalized with 950MM of 144a debt and 125MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 31703 the Enron topup obligation  The 31703 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water  As long as Wessex is worth at least 26Bn there will be no Enron topup required  If we take a 25 haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide 650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt  This 650MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energy-related assets and other assets  It was initially capitalized with 24Bn of 144a debt and 220MM in equity ENE and institutionals  As with Marlin the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b 1Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup  Assuming the same 25 hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx 600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash income and equity  The debt must be retired by 91702 with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions  The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our 10Q will be filed five days late  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing  The committee meets 2-3 timesweek sometimes more often  The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually 7 days a week  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for  That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15 of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval  However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year  Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing 19Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is 21Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the 35Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear  The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas  The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels  It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us McMahon  There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers  But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made
