Subject George W This was sent to me  I dont know who wrote it but it is good Subject George W This was the same man who came within a hairs breadth of losing an election in November who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida Democratic machine to fix the vote count This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in younger years and whose happy-go-lucky lifestyle led him to mediocre grades in college and an ill-fated oil venture This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father and whose speaking missteps became known as Bushisms And on Friday this was the man who bore the weight of the world and the responsibilities of a generation with dignity class confidence appropriate solemnity and even much-needed wit One thing struck me during the campaign that difficult roller-coaster campaign that now seems years ago It was that George W Bush never seemed to get ruffled Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or the sudden some would say vicious release of a DUI arrest two decades ago at a key moment W did not lose his cool At times his staff seemed overconfident as did many of us A 350-electoral-vote win they quietly implied and we optimistically believed Then they counted the votes miscounted others and re-counted still others At the end he was still there Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed and puffed trying to gin up something out of nothing Bush quietly but confidently waited at his ranch He did nothing  that is the mistake people have constantly made with this man confusing lack of bluster for absence of action No his team of attorneys and the iron-willed James Baker were carrying out his orders but W stayed in the background confident and faithful You see it is this faith business that confounded everyone We  have had such actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically whenever anyone used the term faith But this was the same man who was the first politician ever in recent memory to name Jesus Christ as the lord of his life on public TV Not an oblique reference to being born-again or having a life change He said the un-PC-like phrase Jesus Christ to which his handlers and advisors no doubt off stage were also saying Jesus Christ in a much different tone God has a way of honoring those who honor him David learned  that while he was on the run from Sauls armies Job learned that after his time of horrible tribulation The Messiah said so Himself many times So this was the man who actually put faith into practice He actually loves those who hate him It is a staggering concept so foreign in daily occurrence that few thought it anything but grandstanding Even one of Ws biggest supporters chided the president for adhering to his new tone Yet there he was again and again thanking the Democrats Appointing his enemies to high places in his government Inviting his former foes and their wives to private movie screenings and I know this is  hard to stomach even treating them with dignity See this was the man who learned early on how faith worked by praying for his enemies you heap burning coals upon their heads Happen to catch Bill Clinton at the National Prayer Service  Didnt look too good did he This was the man who named the absolute top people in national  security and defense then caught barbs from the politically righteous  that this one didnt have the right views on abortion or that one didnt  have the right position on guns And on September 11 at midmorning this was the man thrust into a position only known by Roosevelt Churchill Lincoln and Washington The weight of the world was on his shoulders and the responsibility of a generation was on his soul So this same man---the one that the media repeatedly attempted to tarnish with charges of illegitimacy and the one whose political opponents desperately sought to stonewall until mid-term elections--- walked to his seat at the front of the National Cathedral just three days after the two most impressive symbols of American capitalism and prosperity virtually evaporated along with perhaps thousands of Americans As he sat down next to his wife immediately I knew that even if  his faith ever faltered hers didnt I have never seen a more peaceful  face than Laura Bush whose eyes seemed as though they were already gazing at the final outcome    not just of this conflict but of  her reward in Heaven itself In this marriage you indeed got two for the price of  one The appropriate songs were sung as one said to in an almost unbearably emotional service I for one broke down innumerable  times merely  listening on tape delay on the radio How the man spoke without blubbering Ill never know Then came the defining moment of our generation Some people  fondly recall their Woodstock days Others mark with grim sadness  November 22 1963 as the day America lost her innocence But I firmly believe when the history of this time is written it will be acknowledged by  friend  and foe alike that President George W Bush came of age in that  cathedral and lifted a nation off its knees It wasnt so much his words though read a  decade later they will indeed be as stirring as any The conflict  would  end he noted at a time of our choosing It certainly wasnt his emotion What had to have been one of the most stunning exhibitions of  self-control in presidential history W was able to deliver his remarks without  losing either his resolve or his focus or more important his  confidence It was as if Gods hand which had guided him through that sliver-thin  election now rested fully on him His quiet confidence let our enemies know    and believe me they know    that they made a grave miscalculation Now this same man who practiced his faith through a tough election who steeled his convictions even more in a drawn-out  Florida battle and  who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with  his foes well OK maybe the Clymer comment is an exception this  same man now lifted the weight of the world and the responsibility of a generation and put it on his modest shoulders as though it were  another unpleasant duty As he walked back to his seat the camera angle was appropriate He was virtually alone in the scene alone in that massive place of  God just him and the Lord But thats the way its always been in his  life recently In that brief time it took him to return to his seat I  believe he  heard words to the effect of You can do this George I am with  you always And you can do this well because I am going before you And dont  worry about the weight Ive got it And I saw in his eyes a quiet acknowledgment I know  Thank you Lord Back at his seat when W sat down George H W Bush reached  over and took his sons hand The elder Bush always struck me as a  religious  man but not someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the  Lord George H W  treats the Father like a respected uncle visiting him  on appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real but not constant Anyway I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H W said  I wish I could do this for you son but I cant You have to do this on your  own W squeezed  back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept throughout It said I dont have to do it alone dad Ive got help

Sent	Tuesday October 16 2001 926 AM To	All Enron WorldwideENRON Subject	Third Quarter Earnings Results Today we announced our third quarter earnings results which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of 043  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines  In addition we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of 045 for the fourth quarter 180 for 2001 and 215 for 2002 We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enrons business strategy and performance so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter Over the past few months we have met with analysts to discuss Enrons performance  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units  In response to that feedback we have provided results separately for several of our business units  For example while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities  In addition information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services  This quarter they are reported separately   Finally even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services we are continuing to report that business separately Following are the highlights of our businesses Wholesale Services Total income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT increased 28 to 754 million in the third quarter  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65 to 882 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day Tbtued Americas IBIT increased 31 to 701 million  Natural gas volumes increased 6 to 267 Tbtud and power volumes increased 77 to 290 million megawatt hours MWh Europe and Other Commodity Markets IBIT remained unchanged at 53 million as compared to last year  While physical gas and power volumes increased low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat Retail Services Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of 71 million compared to 27 million a year ago  So far this year EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95000 deals with small business customers Transportation and Distribution Natural Gas Pipelines IBIT increased slightly to 85 million in the third quarter Portland General We reported an IBIT loss of 17 million this quarter compared to IBIT of 74 million a year ago  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter  Last week we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural  This transaction is expected to close next year Global Assets This segment includes Elektro Dabhol TGS Azurix and Enron Wind  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at 19 million compared to last year Broadband Services IBIT losses were 80 million in the current quarter compared to a 20 million loss last year  This quarters results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs Corporate and other This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions This segment reported an IBIT loss of 59 million compared to 106 million a year ago In addition this quarter we announced one-time charges of 101 billion  Over the past few quarters we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses  These charges include 	A 287 million write-down of Azurix Corp 	183 million
