You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids and how much you hated "big kid" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you want for them.

Love,
Jay

Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?  Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas -- I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn

Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see it coming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.
 
Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.

Hey Jay,
 
Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a "sexy" company. 
 
Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.  
 
See ya,

Subject: George W.


This was sent to me.  I don't know who wrote it but it is good!

Subject: George W.


 This was the same man who came within a hair's breadth of losing an
election in
November, who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida Democratic
machine to fix the vote count.
 This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in younger
years, and whose happy-go-lucky lifestyle led him to mediocre grades in
college
and an ill-fated oil venture.
 This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father, and
whose
speaking missteps became known as "Bushisms." And on Friday, this was the
man
who bore the weight of the world and the responsibilities of a generation
with
dignity, class, confidence, appropriate solemnity,
 and even much-needed wit.
 One thing struck me during the campaign, that difficult,
 roller-coaster campaign that now seems years ago. It was that George W.
Bush
never seemed to get ruffled. Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or
the
sudden (some would say, vicious) release of a DUI arrest two decades ago at
 a key moment, "W" did not lose his cool. At times, his staff seemed
overconfident, as did many of us. A 350-electoral-vote win, they quietly
implied
and we optimistically believed. Then they counted the votes, miscounted
others,
and re-counted still others. At the end, he was still there.
 Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed and puffed, trying to gin up
something out of nothing, Bush quietly but confidently waited at his ranch.
He
did nothing:  that is the mistake people have constantly made with this man,
confusing lack of bluster for absence of action. No, his team of attorneys
and
the iron-willed James Baker were carrying out his orders, but W
 stayed in the background, confident and faithful.
 You see, it is this faith business that confounded everyone. We  have had
such
actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically whenever
anyone used the term faith.
 But this was the same man who was the first politician ever in
 recent memory to name Jesus Christ as the lord of his life on public TV.
 Not an oblique reference to being "born-again" or having a "life change."
 He said the un-PC-like phrase, "Jesus Christ," to which his handlers and
advisors, no doubt, off stage, were also saying, "Jesus Christ" in a much
different tone.
 God has a way of honoring those who honor him. David learned  that while he
was
on the run from Saul's armies. Job learned that after his time of horrible
tribulation. The Messiah said so Himself, many times. So this was the man
who
actually put faith into practice. He actually loves those who hate him. It
is a
staggering concept, so foreign in daily occurrence
 that few thought it anything but grandstanding. Even one of W's biggest
supporters chided the president for adhering to his "new tone."
 Yet there he was, again and again, thanking the Democrats.
 Appointing his enemies to high places in his government. Inviting his
former
foes and their wives to private movie screenings, and (I know, this is  hard
to
stomach) even treating them with dignity. See, this was the man who
 learned early on how faith worked: by praying for his enemies, you "heap
burning coals upon their heads." Happen to catch

Bill Clinton at the National Prayer Service?  Didn't look too good, did he?

 This was the man who named the absolute top people in national  security
and
defense, then caught barbs from the politically righteous  that this one
didn't
have the right views on abortion or that one didn't  have the right position
on
guns.
 And on September 11, at midmorning, this was the man thrust into a position
only known by Roosevelt, Churchill, Lincoln, and
 Washington. The weight of the world was on his shoulders, and the
responsibility of a generation was on his soul.
 So this same man---the one that the media repeatedly attempted to tarnish
with
charges of "illegitimacy," and the one whose political opponents desperately
sought to stonewall until mid-term elections--- walked to his seat at the
front
of the National Cathedral just three days after the two most impressive
symbols
of American capitalism and
 prosperity virtually evaporated, along with, perhaps, thousands of
Americans.
 As he sat down next to his wife, immediately I knew that even if  his faith
ever faltered, hers didn't. I have never seen a more
 peaceful  face than Laura Bush, whose eyes seemed as though they were
already
gazing at the final outcome . . . not just of this conflict, but of  her
reward
in
 Heaven itself. In this marriage, you indeed got two for the price of  one.
 The appropriate songs were sung, as one said, to in an almost
 unbearably emotional service. I, for one, broke down innumerable  times
merely  listening on tape delay on the radio. How the man spoke without
blubbering,
I'll never know.
 Then came the defining moment of our generation. Some people  fondly recall
their Woodstock days. Others mark with grim sadness  November 22, 1963, as
the
day America lost her innocence. But I firmly believe when the history of
this
time is written, it will be acknowledged by  friend  and foe alike that
President George W. Bush came of age in that  cathedral
 and lifted a nation off its knees. It wasn't so much his words,
 though read a  decade later, they will indeed be as stirring as any. The
conflict  would  end, he noted, "at a time of our choosing." It certainly
wasn't
his emotion.
 What had to have been one of the most stunning exhibitions of  self-control
in
presidential history, W was able to deliver his
 remarks without  losing either his resolve or his focus, or, more
important,
his  confidence.
 It was as if God's hand, which had guided him through that
 sliver-thin  election, now rested fully on him. His quiet confidence let
our
enemies know . . . and believe me, they know . . . that they made a grave
miscalculation.
  Now, this same man who practiced his faith through a tough
 election, who steeled his convictions even more in a drawn-out  Florida
battle,
and  who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with  his
foes (well, OK, maybe the "Clymer" comment is an exception), this  same
 man now lifted the weight of the world and the responsibility of a
generation
and put it on his modest shoulders as though it were  another unpleasant
duty.
 As he walked back to his seat, the camera angle was appropriate.
 He was virtually alone in the scene, alone in that massive place of  God,
just
him and the Lord. But that's the way it's always been in his  life
recently. In
that brief time it took him to return to his seat, I  believe he  heard
words to
the effect of, "You can do this, George. I am with  you always.
 And you can do this well, because I am going before you. And don't  worry
about the weight. I've got it." And I saw in his eyes a quiet
acknowledgment.
 "I know.  Thank you, Lord."
  Back at his seat, when W sat down, George H. W. Bush reached  over and
took
his son's hand. The elder Bush always struck me as a  religious  man, but
not
someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the  Lord.
 George H. W.  treats the Father like a respected uncle, visiting him  on
appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real, but not
constant.
 Anyway, I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H. W. said,  "I wish
I
could do this for you, son, but I can't. You have to do this on your  own."
W
squeezed  back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept
throughout.
 It said, "I don't have to do it alone, dad. I've got help."

Aaron,



Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Production Injection poin twe have --


			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172


and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	     


when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause future loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172





Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I need to take a few hours off Tuesday afternoon after lunch.  I have some family business to attend to.  I should only be gone 2 hours or so.  Susan will be here to handle EOL.  Let me know if you have a problem with this.  I know I need to be here, but this is something I have to take care of and this was the only time I could schedule it.

Saturday Weather Forecast for New Orleans:

Saturday morning:  70% chance of showers and thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain possible.

Saturday noon: 60-70% chance of thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain likely.

Saturday late afternoon:  Rain chances decreasing, 30% chance of lingering showers.  

Saturday evening and night:  Clearing skies.

That is the best I can come up with right now.  Front is moving through on Saturday and it is all based on timing.  If the front slows down or speeds up, then of course it will greatly change the forecast.  My guess is that the front will come through faster than indicated and possibly by mid to late afternoon, rain chances will be nil, but at this point that is kind of risky.

Hope this helps.

Jay

I would guess that Paul will lose his job within the next few weeks...but that should not leave the walls of your house.  I think I am ok if I want to stay.  It is really a scary situation and this is what I get for corporate lifestyle I guess.  We probably won't know the full effects for several more months, but I think that a lot of people will get laid off before Christmas.

Gald to hear that Mom and Dad made it ok.  Hope y'all are having fun together.  

How are you feeling?  I have not talked to you since your wonderful phone call.  I heard you were going through some pretty bad morning sickness but that things were better now.  I am praying that from here on out you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Really try to enjoy it.  Let me know how you are doing and what you need or need for the baby.  However, I am not available to go pick up ice cream and a pickle at 2am, that is W.R.'s job.  I have already done that.

Take care and I will try to keep you posted.

Love,
Jay

Jay,

Just a quick note to let you know that Mom and Dad arrived around 10am on
Sunday morning.  I took the day off yesterday and we did a few things around
the house and a little shopping.  Uncle Bob arrived around 11:00am from
Phoenix and we went to lunch.  He was back on the road for Houston around
1:00pm.  There is a new subdivision going up down the street from us so we
walked down there yesterday afternoon and wandered through some of the
houses.  Dad seemed to enjoy it -- walking off the sq footage, inspecting
the construction, etc.

WR and I have been really watching the situation with Enron and have our
fingers crossed that things will work out for you now that the deal with
Dynergy has been announced.  Uncle Bob seemed to think that Paul is in a
pretty precarious situation with his job.

Take care and tell the girls 'Aunt Lyn says hi.'

Hello Torrey,
	I examined past CIG deals and made code changes to allow default meter 991764500 when Enron sells physical gas.  Assuming deals continue to be sent as before, I have results of sample deals production which I tested with; see below.  Please test the changes at your earliest convenient.  Thanks.

Hi Dat,

As per Jay's request, is it possible to set the SITARA bridge to attach the following two default meter numbers to CIG Mainline deals, depending on whether they are buys or sales (from Enron's perspective)?

Essentially, any deal in which Enron is the seller and the location is at Pipe "CIG" and trade zone "CENTRAL" should have a default meter number of 991764500, while any deal in which Enron is the buyer at the same location should go to meter number UNA-516938.

Since the EOL mapping tables can only support one meter number per location, it would be necessary to set this logic up in the SITARA bridge itself. Is this doable from your end?

I would like to have all sales of CIG Mainline next day physical gas to bridge over to Sitara under the following meter location:

CIG/Mainline/991764500

and all buys to 

CIG/Mainline/UNA-516938

Please let me know what effects (if any) this will have on the bridging process, Sitara, and confirmations.

Good question.  I would like the 2 games but this is not about me.  Jr. Monopoly may be a little too much for her still.  She would probably enjoy the Dr. Barbie or the computer game the most.  But she will want to play the game on the computer right then so Mom better be prepared for that.

Hope y'all are having fun.

You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids
and how much you hated "big kid" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my
opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and
games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas
and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and
have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you
want for them.

Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may
not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the
girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will
be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send
them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?
Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry
box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be
for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas --
I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn

Sent:	Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:26 AM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Third Quarter Earnings Results


Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

I agree that we should not move the business at this time, but we do need cross-training to occur.  Eventually the business should come here to Houston.  The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed.  My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction.  I also think that some of our counterparties are confused as to who to call concerning these types of deals and that trading decisions are being made in Denver without our knowledge until after the fact.  This is something that I have heard from you and Barry that should not be happening.

I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down.

In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.  Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees.  Let me know if you have any issues with this.

If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.

I was kind of hoping that you would know that because I really don't know.  Last I heard I was an associate and I guess I could be labeled as Eastern Rockies Natural Gas Trader.  If you don't know, ask Mike to be sure.

Thanks,

Jay

I have had a few people test the system.  It looks like it works very well except if you hit ENTER instead of TAB then the form will be submitted.  If that could be corrected so that you have to hit the SUBMIT button to submit, then I think it is ready to go.

Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you and thanks again for your hard work on this.

The meeting with IHS Energy representatives will take place tomorrow from 10:30 to 1:30 in EB3321
It will probably take a while to set up the equipment, I would think the actual presentation will start about 11:30.
Please let me know if you will be able to attend.
