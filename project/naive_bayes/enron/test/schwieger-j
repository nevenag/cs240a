Hi Jim.  
 
We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and
a Chrysler Town & Country. 

Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration. He prefers
the smoother ride of the minivan. It will be better for taking long trips.
The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns
16. Ha! : ) 

We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has
many "bells and whistles" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.

We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the
Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value. The
Toyota dealer also has "$300 over invoice" sale on currently. Plus they told
Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can
choose from. 

So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.
What do you think?
 
Love,
Linda
 
PS  We got a pkg. in the mail today from you.  Thanks!!  I will wait until the kids are here to open it.

Hi Jim
 
Hope work is going ok with all the changes taking place there.
 
Just wanted to let you know we have been looking at cars.  
 
We asked the kids what they thought.  They really like the SUV's. 
 
I think another mini-van would be great as far as room to move around as well as having 7 places to sit, but the kids are a little more interested in what looks "cool".         : )
 
There are a couple midsize suv's that now have a third seat (although the seat it is closer to the ground).  That might be a good compromise.(?)
 
Anyway, it sure is FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to look.  
 
Thanks for being there for us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Let me know if you have any thoughts on the process.
 
Love and Hugs
 
Linda

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both
interconnects
to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language
requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances
constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this
way
both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and
delivery
interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.

John:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss=
ions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value o=
f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution=
.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t=
ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str=
uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations =
of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o=
f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr=
on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde=
d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h=
ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa=
irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan=
 so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s=
olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny =
an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un=
der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of =
the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

Hello.

Good news!  Ben passed all of his classes...by the skin of his teeth, so he
is able to come to Houston.  :)

Ben and I both tried to find the web site about the wave runner license but
were unsuccessful.  Were you able to ask your friends?  Ben is now very
anxious to take the test so he can drive one of the wave runners.

Love,
Linda

If measurement is correct, this will cause the texas desk to inject 235,182 mmbtu's more in March than they expected.  Is there any way we can come up with a better explanation than the field estimates were wrong?  We need to assure commercial that the cause for the discrepancy is explanable and correctable.
Let me know if the cause for the incorrect field estimates can be determined.

As you know, Commercial's expectations are derived from estimates.  I have rechecked the data with Measurement and it has been determined that the EFM data is correct and no adjustments will be made.  It is believed the estimates were entered wrong from the field.

It seems the variance between commercial's expectation and measurement has not been resolved.  Please let me know what caused this variance.  The variance needs to be resolved ASAP since accounting has to close its books for March.

Chris:

Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from s=
omeone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a met=
hod that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is tha=
t the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from sto=
rage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percent=
age was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.=
  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the=
 Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would =
try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures=
 for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refill=
ing, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining invento=
ry.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu fa=
ctor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected =
as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints =
This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increase=
s your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I wou=
ld appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is u=
sed and how it is put in the model.

Hi Jim,=20

I'm still working on the modelling of the Kathleen Ann storage and one of t=
he issues I need to account for is mmbtu enhancement. How would you suggest=
 I account for this? Currently, to get the the intrinsic storage value, I t=
ake the max working gas capacity times the may/jun - dec spread over the cu=

ll -- although this wouldn't account for the physical capacity contraints, =
it would put a value on the enhancement.

Sorry about not returning your call this morning!
I was trying to finish my questions for the All Employee meeting!  
Like it made any difference!
They would not address any of my questions.
What made it worst is I can not believe how STUPID the general Enron employee population is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the midst of the worst company crisis ever, when they have a chance to ask important questions, they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind!
I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten!!!
I'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone!  Except you of course!

lets talk tonight.

How are you this morning?
Are you listening to the investor conference call?
Are you going to the employee meeting?

You need to let me know when you have regular scheduled meetings so i'm not calling at those times.
When does nymex open and close?

I could tell you were in a meeting when i called this morning. It also sounded like you are sick. Are you???

Not too much going on up here, just the usual pissed off customers yelling at me!

Hope all is well.

I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.
	1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 
	2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.
			VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L
	   EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION
	   CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION
	   TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION
	3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit.
			The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.
			(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)
		This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  

Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.

	Thanks,  Jim

Yes, all withdrawals for Centana should be in the same month (May).  If we don't have a deal ticket for the additional April injections Kenny please prepare one for my signature.

Your deals are correct.  We need to write a new deal ticket for March 2001 since we injected an additonal 21,640 mmbtus.  The total was 193,050 according to scheduling.  We need to find out if Tom wants us book the withdrawal of this additional gas in May like the rest of the withdrawals.  We are still injecting in April.  We also need to find out if he wants us to write another assumption for April's injections.

I have a different # for Spindletop.  I have two deals.  One at 26590 mmbtus and the other at -198000 for a total of 171410 injection.  Is the 26590 fuel?  They are on the same ticket.

Please send me the detail for March storage assumptions.  The assumptions should equal 7,863,146 mmbtu.  You should also have ProductionTax deals.  The Prod. Tx should net to zero.

Subject:	Interconnect Reimbursement Language

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both interconnects to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this way both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and delivery interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.

Anne

I left the following in your office this morning:

1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.  We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.

2) D.L. Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.   AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.  However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.  

Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.  I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 


'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses," Lay said. "The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence." 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

"These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully," he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

"Everything we know, you now know," Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Hi Tammy!  Thanks for asking about me!
I'm doing fine.  I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess.
It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly. 
I thought that things were supposed to make more sense as you grow older?

How about you and Mike?  
I hope all is well!  If there is anything I can do please let me know?

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

Hi Jim,

The shipping quote to your door is 269.00/game. There was know price break
on two or more because they had to be but on individual pallets.  Here are
some pictures of what I have available in the classic games. I almost forgot
to tell you.  We have a brand new gauntlet Legends 4 player in a dedicated
Cabinet available for only 2,195.00 this game was 3995 new a year ago.  It
is brand new and never been used.  It's a great buy if you like action
adventures games.  I think your kids will like it.  Also 4 players can play
at the same time.  It a great game with lots of hidden treasures and secret
doors.  We only have two units left and I think the skating rink in League
City, TX is going to get one.  Also would you want us to set them on free
play for you or do you want to use quarters to make them work.  It's your
choice.  It's the last picture title Gauntletebay.jpg

Let me know if you have made any decisions

Thanks,

Lutz

Brad:
Right now we have to assume that we will be withdrawing Nov. 2000 through March, 2001 with a goal of emptying the facility down to 60 BCF.  This will require the injection of approximately 55 BCF of gas from April 1, 2001 through October 31, 2001.  Available run time should be no lower than 98%.  Why would it be greater?
The rest will have to be answered by someone else.

Subject:	Estimation of Potential KVSR fuel expense

Hanover Compression has given me a revised fuel consumption number of 7150 BTU/horsepower-hr for the KVSRs once they have been converted to Clean Burn technology.  This compares to the present 7500 BTU/horsepower-hr.  We need to come to a consensus on the assumptions that will be used with this figure.  These assumptions will need to be as follows:

How many hours a year do we really think that these units will run?  I am assuming that they will not be running if Bammel is on withdrawal.  Correct or not?
How much horsepower will really run?  This will be determined by how much market HPL will hope to capture from ANP and possibly Equistar.  It will also be affected by the suction pressure of the gas, which is, in turn, determined by how much HPL is injecting and pressures at Katy.
Finally, what available run time do we want to assume here?  90%?

I have no preconceived notions of what these assumptions should be; therefore, I am soliciting input from each of you.  We need to be in agreement before Emma starts her work.  Thank you.

Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"  
"Sure," said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, "Now go out and play."  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"

I slept good also!
Today is supposed to be close to 90, but then the front moves through and Thursday is supposed to be 74
I would like to do the half marathon with you but unless I have allot more free time I don not think I can get into a shape that I could run that far! 
I'm really fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm getting pressure or inferences that if I do not drop things my bonus might not be there!
Saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter!
They really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance!
It does get me down because I'm not sure mankind is worth it!
If people you thought had standards, ethics and morals are now applying pressure, whets the use?

Sorry, to be complaining!
Talk to you later!

How are you this morning?
I slept really well last night.
Just trying to get some contracts written and signed up here.
It's cooler today and still very very windy. Only supposed to be 50 today, but back to 70 this weekend.

I see that houston is now offering a half marathon.......are you interested?
I wouldn't mind doing that and Andy with Pennaco said he wouldn't mind running it either.

Hope all is well.

Have a great day!!

When is this tax due?  If it is paid at the end of the year - it is 100% for the account of AEP.

Subject:	BAMMEL AD VALORUM TAX

As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.

The sky is falling! The sky is falling! 
Oh, never mind that's just Enron stock price!
It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here!
Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!

Dear Monique,

The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric from gas in 1999.
There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have improved from what you have to the following:
	Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF
	Maximum Injection Capacity: 510,000 Mcf/d
	Maximum Withdrawal Capacity:  1,400,000 Mcf/d
Call 713-853-7705 if you have questions.

I thought ENE would be down for sure today?
Everyone was talking about it here before the market opened.
I guess the Market is just happy we told the truth?  Or they thought it was more?

I feel pretty good but I had time to adjust yesterday afternoon.
Got taxes done for everyone.

Baseball game tonight at 8:00

Why are you out of the office on Tuesday?

Be Good!

Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
next to ours.  
Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?

If the MMBtu enhancement is this high, have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept (exceed pipeline spec's).  Will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content?

Garry,

As part of the KAF modelling, I would like to account for the mmbtu enhancement. However, I would like your input as to what the most appropriate number to use. Currently--as per Brian Redmond--we have a 110% enhancement (I think this is the number that the GLO folks threw out at the meeting we attended). Is this in the ballpark? 

Thanks and best regards,

Chris

Subject:	MidCon Agreements

Attached are the revised agreements based on our discussion prior.  Please review and if everything  looks good, I will prepare executables for MidCon.
Please note the following revisions:

	1.  Midcon installs, owns, and operates the Deer Park Interconnect.	
	2.  HPL installs, owns, and operates the Flagstaff Interconnect.
	3.  If the pressures committments are violated in accordance with the terms, the violating party pays the others cost incurred at that interconnect.
	4.  Each Party still entitled to 1/2 capacity at each interconnect.

  

Please call if you have any questions.  x-33512.

Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information:
	1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future?					
	2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service?
Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions.

No working gas available to sell to the winning bidder, but we will probably have some Cushion Gas that we will have to pay back!

Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion Gas.

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually withdrawn what we have booked.

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in

Jim, I know I asked you a similar or maybe even the samequestion a few weeks ago but I really believe that the question was limited to ERCOT and we therefore determined that other than Bammel , Enron had no storage in ERCOT......I do recall that you mentioned 2 places where we had capacity...but that were not in ERCOT...I do believe they are in TEXAS and the question now is Enron's storage capacity in all of TEXAS.  

I need this information Urgently.................PLEASE HELP!!!!!!

I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.  I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

When is this tax due?  If it is paid at the end of the year - it is 100% for the account of AEP.

Subject:	BAMMEL AD VALORUM TAX

As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.

I'm in a really sour mood.
I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time!
I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
It's the "pits"
I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself.
I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things.
My excuse is that I'm always exhausted
I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this.
I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!
 
ENE is down $1.42 right now!
No news that I know of?
The DOW is down (113) right now.
It appears that things may be escalating in Afghanistan.
I think the Special Forces are close.
 
Have fun at Jackson Hole!

Please respond for me.  You should probably notify them that it will be changing with the sell of HPL.

Subject:	Working Gas - Triple Lutz

Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion Gas.

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually withdrawn what we have booked.

Jason:
As we talked last week Cannon Interest Houston has called and indicated that they would like to extend the current Base Load Buy / Sell Contract and also their Bammel Storage Contract.  I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows:
	The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February.
	The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.

	The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  

The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  

I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

Jim,

Do you remember Rob Lloyd?  He know works at AIM Funds here in town.  Please read the piece below - I think it is well written and summarizes our sad situation succinctly.

Jean, 

Thought you'd find this interesting.  It's an excerpt from an analyst's note
out this AM.

A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:
It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,
but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.

The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various
off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently
became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,
their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into
something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began
30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)
sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They
involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value
(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This
allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.

If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very
New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,
to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the
latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the
table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM
partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.
Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed
muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized
in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had
used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these
were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.

Remember the Centanna Storage Contract you reviewed a couple of weeks back.  It has never been signed I'm waiting on a few replacement pages from Duke.  Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?  Do I need special approval?  Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.  If the term needs to be reduced they are willing to do whatever it takes.  I would appreciate your input as to what to do or whom I should talk.

Linda called and said that they do not have enough vacation days left in 2001, so they would like to use one of the later packages in 2002.
They asked how late in 2002 they could possibly go and I said I would have to ask you what's available.
Give me a call when you get a chance.
This is what I could not remember the other day when we talked.

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"  
"Sure," said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, "Now go out and play."  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"

How are you today?
The ball game last night was a disaster!
We give the "Bad News Bears" a bad name.
Example:  Runners on 1st and 2nd. I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.  He replies touch third base.  So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.  I give up!  We lost 20 to 3

On a worse note.  Please don't say anything to anybody but Pat just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce.
I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.  She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.  He has done nothing but foster this attitude.  Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse.
I will let you know what comes of things.

Why can't everything just work out instead of all this turmoil.  I hate all of this shit!  It hurts!

	Love Jim

The balance in my 401K plan is $547,038 in the Stable Asset Acct.  There is around $200 in ENE and $200 in one of the other funds.  How I got that who know!
Esop is around $105.  The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years.
Cash Balance Plan would not allow me access today!  I think it is around $35,000.  I believe Pat should have a copy of my last statement (June 30, 2001)

I hope this is what you were looking for?

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

	Jim

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;
