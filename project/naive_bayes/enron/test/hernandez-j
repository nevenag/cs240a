This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
 
1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.
2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name.
3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.
4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.
11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.
14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.
18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.
21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.
22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
 
Power to la Raza
 
I thought this was something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Hey guys and girls, we will be having our monthly meeting on Thursday Oct. 18.  Please bring any questions and concerns to the meeting.  The schedules for November and December have been set.  I tried to be as accommodating as possible.  If anyone has a scheduling conflict along the lines of vacation or needing some time off, try to switch out with someone first.  If no one will switch out with you please see me or don.  If you wanted to work some holidays and I wasn't able to get you in, talk to Don or myself.  That is all!  See you on Thursday.  

p.s.  Powermart is next week, I encourage everyone to get out to the parties at night.  See Don or myself about what day and time for the parties.

Everyone,
 
There has been a major shakeup at TRW.  I have always  worked for TRW Automotive Electronics.  Well, we just got told that we TRW  AE has been dissolved and no longer exists.  I support the Safety  & Security, along with some Body Control plants.  Well, now I am  supposed to be going to the division known as Occupant Safety Systems (Airbags  & Seatbelts).  I am not sure what is going to  happen........

Hey guys and gals our problems with pjm #'s has been cleared up at last.  A spreadsheet has been set-up to give us pjm #'s.  Its located in M:/ELECTRIC/24HR/NIGHTSHIFTDATA/PJMHOURLY.  The northeast guys will import their numbers into this spreadsheet everyday before they leave.  Our group will be responsible for the evening hours.  Please keep track of these when you come in to work the evening shift.  This procedure is temporary until the northeast guys start their 24 hour desk.  The start date for the northeast guys will be Nov. 1.  That is all!

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This is a heads up on the situation.

OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR ENRON KIDS' CENTER IS UNDERWAY!!!

Want to be closer to your child during the workday?  Want to read to them at lunchtime or just give them a hug?  Then consider enrolling your child in the Enron Kids' Center.

Enron Kids' Center child care facility is currently under construction and will be located on Louisiana Street, across from our corporate headquarters in Houston. Enron is partnering with Knowledge Beginnings, one of the leaders in the child care industry, to provide high quality, conveniently located, customer service-oriented childcare for Enron employees in Houston. 


Anticipated opening date:	September 2001

Hours of operation:		The center will be open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM - 6:30 PM. The center will be closed on all Enron holidays. In addition, special "parents' night out" care will be offered for occasions such as holiday shopping and night out at the movies for an additional fee.

Complete meal service:	Your child's breakfast, lunch and two snacks are included in tuition. Infants will need to bring their own food until they are ready for "table food".	

Eligibility:			Regular full-time or part-time Enron employees who are the parents or legal guardians of the child or children named on the application are eligible to enroll their children in the center.  Temporary employees, contract workers and non-custodial parents are not eligible to enroll their children in the child development center.

Contact Information:		Visit http://enronkids.enron.com to learn more about Enron Kids' Center or contact Knowledge
				Beginnings at 1-877-CHILDHOOD (between 8:00 am -5:00 p.m. PST).

Johnny I got the go-ahead from Kevin to make an offer to Ryan.  I think that something in the low to mid 60's should work.  

Thanks.

Mike,

We will be leaving Oct. 4 and returning Oct. 7.  You just need to get to H-town and we will fly you up to Vegas.  We will be staying at the Paris Hotel.  There will be golfing, catching a show or a day at the spa.  Let me know as soon as you can.

Hey guys and girls, we will be having our monthly meeting on Thursday Oct. 18.  Please bring any questions and concerns to the meeting.  The schedules for November and December have been set.  I tried to be as accommodating as possible.  If anyone has a scheduling conflict along the lines of vacation or needing some time off, try to switch out with someone first.  If no one will switch out with you please see me or don.  If you wanted to work some holidays and I wasn't able to get you in, talk to Don or myself.  That is all!  See you on Thursday.  

p.s.  Powermart is next week, I encourage everyone to get out to the parties at night.  See Don or myself about what day and time for the parties.

I know you guys have done some of these things.


YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT A "SERIOUS" LATINO BIRTHDAY PARTY IF:

 > 1. Some of the guests didn't bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited
 > kids.
 > 2. When the cake says "Happy Birthday, Mijo" instead of the child's real
 > name.
 > 3. The party is at Chuck E. Cheese but they bring their own food,
 > cake, and a pi?ata.
 > 4. It's a child's party but there are more grown-ups than kids.
 > 5. It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and the party food is carne asada,
 > arroz con frijoles y 10 cases of Beer.
 > 6. Instead of "Pin the tail on the donkey", there is usually a
 > televised baseball, football or basketball game, or a live fight.
 > 7. They don't sing Happy Birthday. Instead everyone is dancing salsa.
 > 8. The party was "over" at 5. It's 10 and the party is just starting.
 > 9. The host calls someone who's on their way and tells them to stop
 > and get some tortillas and ice.
 > 10. The guests start arriving and the hostess disappears to get ready.
 > 11.The party is on Saturday, and you get a call from the hostess
 > Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday party tomorrow at 3."
 > 12.Some guests bring gifts that are still in the store bag, unwrapped.
 > 13. You have the party over at your brother's because he just bought
 > a new house, with a pool.
 > 14.The cake didn't come from the store; it came from the mother of
 > the comadre of your friend's sister, the one who makes really good
 > cakes.
 > 15.You're told to save your plate and fork for the cake.
 > 16.Someone calls and says they can't make it, but asks that you to
 > save them some cake.
 > 17.Guests are wrapping up cake to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y
 > el Junior.
 > 18. It's "Mijo's" party but since his cousin Brittany is there and
 > her birthday is in a few days, it becomes Mijo's and Brittany's Party.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

We should be checking trans. into Florida on a nightly basis.  You should look at the JEA, FPL, FPC and TAL sites.  Look for any trans available for next day on a hourly or daily basis.  Let the morning guys know of any availability during the morning hand-off.  And on the weekends look for it during the days.  If you see that trans is avail. for Monday on Sunday night give Miguel or myself a call(Before 11:00 p.m).  That is all
