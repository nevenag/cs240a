Subject:	Fwd: We're Home
[Gay, Randall L.]  Brian, Tracy, Sarah and Jack:  i am so happy for all of you.  i'm glad everyone made it home safely and is in good health.
I got the note from your dad, and knew ya'll had left.  Our prayers were with you on your trip.    [Gay, Randall L.]  Sounds like you had a hectic time getting ready, as always.  Im glad the trip seems to have worked out well.  Would like to hear all about it sometime when you have some time. 
[Gay, Randall L.]  
I do apolegize for not getting back to you sooner.  Things have been very strange and busy here.  By now im sure you have heard about the dizzying collapse of Enron.  As of right now i am still employed, but bankruptcy is probably on Monday.  Luckily, the trading floor will probably be sold to an investment bank, so we may continue just as before.  Will have to see how it works out.

And of course, Thanksgiving was a very busy time, visiting family and such.  Katy is doing wonderful.  She likes school, and wants a dirt bike and a pony for Christmas.

I really am happy for ya'll, and hope to see pictures of Jack soon.  Im sure Kathleen is smiling down on ya'll.  Take care and hope to hear from you soon (at least sooner than i get back to you).  

Randy and Katy

Randy,  Attached is a screen print from the Sitara audit report.  Are you the "rgay" who changed this price from $2.22 to $2.20 on deal 1021469?  I'm working on the Reliant Energy Services netout for September production and I'm getting a credit for them on this deal because of this price change.  Can you tell if it's valid?  If it is, I'll give them the credit.  If it's not, can you change the price back so this credit will go away?
