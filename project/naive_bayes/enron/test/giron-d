goes to show that what I think means absolutely nothing 21-7 Wow This game was eerily similar to the TexasOU game Both defense were stellar and shutdown the oppositions offense Some complaints I have heard center on the lack of offenseoffensive creativity in the AM game and Chris Simms decision making in the passing game I disagree If you were at the game you noticed the wind was swirling something fierce and gusting upwards of around 30 mph at times Both punters struggled in the 1st half with punts of 1517191721 and 24 yards Aggie qb Mark Farris threw deep a few times and was picked off once and if not for some superb plays by his wrs at least twice more Texas jumped out early with a td off of a blocked punt and then went into the play-it-safe mode Seeing that balls thrown deep were floating up for grabs and the Aggie offenses inability to move the ball consistently the Longhorns played the OU-style field position game and kept the crowd out of it except for the 39-yard punt return by Mickey Jones in the 3rd quarter when Texas te Mike Jones was liquidated on a block and eventually wore down the undermanned Aggies with 2 scores late in the 4th Could the offense have played better Sure They would certainly be the first to tell you that Simms in my opinion did exactly what the coaches asked him to do play it safe dont go for the home run and dont give them anything cheap to fire up the crowd He did just that No turnovers no silly passes well 1 His touch seemed a little off throwing behind some receivers on occasion but he also looked fantastic in the clutch He fired a missile between 2 Aggies to hit Bo Scaife on 3rd  4 at the Aggie 15 on the games go ahead touchdown drive Benson scored on the next play He took what the defense gave him and now the horns are in Dallas Fine with me A 14-point win at the feared Kyle Field  The Texas Defense is ON FIRE They held the inept Aggie offense to 165 yards total 117 pass 48 rush and 1 touchdown AM Aggie qb Mark Farris was never able to find his receivers and twice found Longhorn defenders wide open Neither offense looked particularly sharp but the horns found a way to pull it out Good teams win Period THE BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME Texas vs Colorado 700 PM ABC Ask and ye shall receive Here we are The Longhorns come in 10-1 Winners of the south thanks Pokes and CU comes in 8-2 claiming the north title These two unexpected opponents know each other pretty well Texas beat the Buffs 41-7 back on Oct 27th in Austin CU looked a little lost that day and Texas pounced on them and wore them down These are not your October Buffalos folks This team has found itself and is brimming with confidence after they thumped Nebraska 62-36 Put it away Buffs you get the Burnt Orange this week  Keys for the game Texas needs to stop the run understatement of the year The Longhorns will put 8 and 9 in the box to stop the quartet of CU backs and dare Bobby Pesavento to beat them CU has in my opinion the best tight end in college football in Daniel Graham He could not be stopped when they met the Huskers and single handedly kept the Nebraska dbs from crowding the line of scrimmage Daniel this is Nathan Vasher On offense Texas will look for the pass to open the run Colorado has a suspect secondary and the horns will try to exploit that with the UT Towers If this happens look for Texas to run well in the 2nd half tEXas tailgate We are having a tEXas tailgate It will be located at the University of Dallas right across the street from Texas Stadium It will begin at 200 pm This seems a little early but

rush1receiving breaking Roy Willams record of 10 set in 2000  Chris Simms passed for 138 yards giving him 2473 for the year Thats 2nd on the all-time list for single season passing yards at Texas Unless something really strange happens thats where hell stay Major holds the record with 3357 yards 1999  Rod Babers blocked his 2nd kick of the season Friday resulting in a touchdown after Tony Jeffrey scooped it up Kool-Aid was the Co-Special Teams Player of the Week in the Big XII for that effort  Texas has now won 8 straight road games  The Longhorns post their 1st 10-win season since 1995 They got their 10th at AM that year too  The Defense had a season high 4 sacks vs the AM Aggies  CU is 9-2 this year tied for the most improved team from 2000 to 01 They were 3-8 in 00 and stand

are records against the Huskers 4th string tailback Chris Brown had 7 touchdowns in the game a CU record That might be more than the Aggies had all season NU was definitely looking ahead to Dallas but

Southern Illinois 56-12 Good for you  Tech beat Stephen F Austin 58-3 Again good for you  Well well Sometimes when I write these there are things that happen that I enjoy so much I want to put them off as long as possible to savor it This is one of those times Let me get this straight- you lost AT HOME to a 3-7 team 3-7 It must have been some sort of trick play I guess A double reverse pass back to the punter or something I cant see any other way that OSU could score with a TRUE FRESHMAN quarterback guiding that Offense Sooner db Derrick Straight said after the game I am in disbelief You and me both D The Sooner secondary is supposed to be vicious but they melted down in the clutch and gave up 2 bombs in the last minute to find a way to lose Coach Bob you seemed so smug in Lubbock after the Texas players left the Tech game saying they had to hope their big brother knocked us off but I guess you forgot about the weak little sister who just sent you and your legions to Dallas for New Years Bring a coat it will probably be a little chilly Thats it for now The horns are 60 minutes from a ring We need everybody there to make Dallas our own Remember the tailgate is free so you should

out there what if the punt was tipped what if it was a safety what in the world was going through Gary Barnetts mind on that fake punt what if the field goal was good wow its really high up here Mostly I thought this no more Dallas Lets not play any more games in the DFW area nothing good happens We will meet the Okies in Waco and playem at Baylor Whos going to mind Certainly not the Bears they really dont use the field much any way and certainly not me 39-37 If you were a 3rd party observer this game was probably very exciting Texas goes up early Colorado roars ahead at half and Texas fights back but falls just short I AM NOT a 3rd party observer The Horns were so close 2 points away from a Big XII Championship Doh Give the Buffaloes their credit they brought that nasty running game that we all thought was an aberration vs Nebraska Chris Brown looked liked he was 9 feet tall have you ever seen a guy run higher than him He makes Eddie George look like a hunchback It was like watching Michael Johnson sprint and the CU o-line was just evil 3 or 4 of those guys will be playing on Sundays next year On defense the horns lack of size showed Its hard to stop a power running game thats clicking with small tackles or even big ones- ask Nebraska and quick defensive ends To their credit the Texas defense did not fold but fought the good fight and stemmed the tide holding CU to 10 points in the 2nd half The 1st half was the killer  The 1st half Oh The Horns looked great to start the game but things went wrong Chris Simms didnt play well and would be the 1st to tell you that it was his worst game at Texas so far 3 interceptions and 1 fumble Ouch Cedric Benson was running well 13 carries for 79 yards and a score before he was hurt with a pinched nerve The horns got down 29-10 and it looked like they would be blown out thats sort of how the OU game in 2000 started but they refused to die and fought back to near even Major Applewhite went from cult hero to certified legend by throwing a 79 yd touchdown pass on his 2nd play after replacing an injured Simms and Texas nearly pulled it out but was too far back in the long run  I want to talk about Simms for a second It would be absurd to say that those 4 turnovers werent the main reason Texas lost It was Chris played badly Horrible There is no other way to say it He is a big boy and I am quite sure he has the mental toughness to hear this and Im sure he has and learn from it It was not your day Lefty turn the page and move on Everybody has them Ty Detmer threw 7 picks in 1 game this year Kurt Warner had 4 v the Saints You will no doubt have more of those when you get to the League in 2003 There is no shame in playing bad as long as you learn something from it You had 2 bad days in 01 but you also had 10 good ones and 3 or 4 great ones Get that 2 down to 1 next year and you will hear no complaints from me of course Im not speaking for everyone I thought the coaches called a good game Greg Davis opened up the playbook with some reverses and deep middle-stuff and Carl Reese was working up-hill most of the night and still held CU to 111 passing and 334 total The blocked punt call in my opinion was a good call Texas got one at AM and needed some help at that point To ask the Horns to go 80  yards through the air there was no Benson so no running game with your big tackle Mike Williams out of the game would have been a tall order Get the block and you set up shop at mid-field or even run it back for 6 They didnt get the block obviously Teams call the punt-block all of the time but dont hit the kicker The kid for Texas missed the punt by 2 inches but fell into the CU punter 1st down Tough break Hindsight is 2020 but I would call it again tEXas tailgate-is in the works It will not be the traditional tailgate like last year but more of a gathering somewhere like a bar restaurant or hotel before we all head to the stadium Another email will follow as soon as it is set up Travel packages

1000 Benson only played a half but his 79 yards put him at 1053 yards for the year He is the 9th player to rush for a grand at Texas  Major Applewhites 233 yards passing give him 8059 career yards breaking the all-time record of 8049 James Brown 1994-97  The Vapor is good Nathan Vasher tied a school record with 7 interceptions in a season He also had 54 yards in punt returns giving him 554 for the year breaking the school record of 538 Johnnie Johnson - 1977  BJ Johnsons 79 yard touchdown catch was his 4th reception of 70  yards All have been touchdowns BJ had his 1st 2 td game and his 4th

youve seen this beforeworth another look This is pretty long but its HYSTERICAL If youve ever been drunk at a sporting event or been with someone who has you can relate This is an e-mail from some guy named JD Horne who according to the messages that were attached to this is not a 21 year-old frat boy but an attorney of indeterminate age He sent it to his friend Brian Brice and it got forwarded around the country You have to give the guy some props for being self-deprecatingbut I hope I never meet him on game day A chronology of events for Saturday December 4 1999 and the early morning hours of Sunday December 5 1999 600 Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 620 Get in car drive to New Braunfels 730 Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning 850 Turn 9 crack open first beer 853 Crack open second beer 858 Crack openyou get the idea 1030 Finish 18 holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 1035 Headed for San Antonio Alamodome - Nebraska vs Texas 1050 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 1110 We decide we dont have enough booze so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol 750 ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam 1150 Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About 70 degrees 1155 I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 1156 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself 1215 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT 1225 In the post-serenade serendipity 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 100 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 130 I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and 11 cans of beer into my pants 147 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as Cell-Phone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those non-refundable non-transferrable sons-of-bitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix non-refundable and non-transferrable Price 712 He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pre-game kingdom 234 Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy 245 I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas 301 The first quarter mercifully ends 9 yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler 336 Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety 356 Halftime score Nebraska 15 Texas 0 I wish I had another Traveler 411 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused 421 I buy my 2nd and 3rd 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies 451 No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more 5 beers from the Alamodome merchants 518 Score is Nebraska 22 Texas 0 I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field 527 I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable 537 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system 549 Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo the Texas mascot stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty 616 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship 630 Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the basketball game 800 Texas-Arizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care 712 We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig 717 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care 801 We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truck-mate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon 830 We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly 847 I am rallying I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona 911 Halftime score Texas 31 Arizona 29 I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me 941 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Centermuch less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light 952 I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing 1009 Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off 1015 After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously 1022 I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops 1043 Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving 1059 With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap 1117 I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the

Versen Victoria Barbe Robin Concannon Ruth Goodell Scott Jones David Kaiser Jared Loving Scott Bates Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject	Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning  Here are my notes  Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements  Watson spoke for c 10 minutes Bergstrom for 5 and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred  If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be 45 Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true  Dynegy owed Enron 50MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps 30MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the off-balance-sheet structures including the credit-linked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible  However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its 364-day facility believe this is the 3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next 6-8 weeks BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office  trading books will need to be combined at closing  EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there  The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded non-core assets  Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT 100 sure that no surprises remain in Enrons books--but that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses  Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops 35Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at 090-095 which represents a 25 haircut to Enron internal estimates  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively short-term in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5 discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices  ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better  No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker

Bloomberg 102501 Enron Taps 3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi ty --- Firm Will Pay Debt Keep Cash Cushion By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R Emshwiller Rebecca Smith an d Jathon Sapsford 10262001 The Wall Street Journal C1 Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc Enron Corp drew down about 3 billion the bulk of its available bank cred it lines in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu idity20 Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about 185 billion of  outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy c oncern with a cash cushion Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access  to bank lines be interrupted The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion-dollar credit line Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong But when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last  few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank s aid an Enron spokesman In a statement the companys new chief financial o fficer Jeff McMahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are mak ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments20 The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days Enron is the natio ns largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e lectricity and natural-gas trades Yesterday for example Enron was involv ed in about 4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit20 Since early last week Enrons share price has plummeted 50 Last week it reported a 618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder  equity of 12 billion It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange  Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer And rew S Fastow who was replaced Wednesday20 The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency Fitch pu t Enron on review for a possible downgrade while another Standard  Poor s changed Enrons credit outlook to negative from stable Moodys Investor s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron  In order to fall below investment grade Enrons credit rating would have t o fall several notches20 If that were to happen however a host of bad consequences could follow T ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price a noninvestment-grade ra ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings In that event Enron could be forced to issue mi llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt diluting the value of ex isting shares At 4 pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enro n was down six cents at 163520 Liquidity is a key issue for Enron which handles energy-trading volumes mo re than triple its next-biggest competitor American Electric Power Co Enr ons EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than  884 billion of trades since it was created in November 199920 The companys wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und erperforming assets elsewhere in the company chiefly the approximately 6 5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India  Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue The cash needs  of its trading operation are immediate it takes time to sell assets parti cularly in todays slower economy20 The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha t have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealing s with Mr Fastow the former chief financial officer Internal documents r elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected  to another company official who has since left Enron While Enron disclose d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings a computerized search of  the SECs database of public filings produced no reference to this other em ployee-related entity known as Chewco20 Chewco was established in 1997 with approximately 400 million in capital  commitments to buy an interest in Enron assets according to one of the pa rtnerships documents The document didnt further specify what assets were  purchased and it didnt disclose the financial impact of the transactions  for either Chewco or Enron Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper a manag ing director in Enrons Global Equity Markets Group according to the docum ent20 Enron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed didnt have any  comment regarding its dealings with Chewco20 Mr Kopper who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t o run the Fastow-related partnerships didnt return phone calls A person  at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr Kopper was traveling In respon se to questions about Chewco an Enron spokesman would say only that Micha el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron Mr Fastow repeatedly h as declined interview requests He severed his relationships with the partn erships in July20 This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar ding related-party transactions Under SEC rule S-K a company has to repor t any transaction that exceeds 60000 and involves any director or execut ive officer By contrast Mr Fastow as CFO would have fallen into that  category but Mr Kopper as managing director of a business unit presumab ly wouldnt have20 However reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard seems to have a broader definition one that might include Mr Kopper  According to FAS Statement 57 a related-party transaction involves a mate rial piece of business between the company and a member of management The statement defines management as directors top officers vice presidents i n charge of major business units and other persons who perform similar pol icy-making functions Persons without formal titles may also be members of  management Copyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights

Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc Officials at Enron Corp whose unusual transactions with its chief financi al officer are under regulatory scrutiny have steadily sold sizable amount s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea r20 Corporate officials had sold 18 million shares valued at about 106 millio n through July as the stock fell to less than 45 a share from 83 at the  start of the year Since July the stock has plummeted an additional 63 to 1635 including a 50 plunge since the beginning of last week Kenneth Lay chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company cashed  in shares for 257 million so far this year usually in transactions paire d with options exercises He sold 429614 shares leaving him with some 28 million shares as of July the latest data available on his sales accordi ng to Thomson FinancialLancer Analytics20 The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr L ays sales of Enron shares for 2000 which reached 307 million In 1999  he sold shares for a total of 26 million20 In Houston an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures saying the company doesnt keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off icials Enron also wouldnt comment on the number of options held by compan y insiders and called the sales a personal decision Many sales by Enron  insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte r option exercises20 Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines  should raise red flags for investors says Jonathan Moreland research dire ctor of InsiderInsightscom who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in vestment ideas20 Among other insiders selling during the year Kenneth Rice former chairman and CEO of Enrons broadband unit sold shares for 237 million Mr Rice has sold 456966 shares of the 15 million shares he was listed as owning  in Enrons March proxy filing Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160000 shares for 98 million during  the year In March Mr Skilling owned 19 million shares20 Messrs Rice and Skilling couldnt be reached to comment20 Overall Enrons insiders were busier selling shares last year when they s old 58 million shares for about 449 million During 1999 insiders sold 3 4 million shares for 1231 million20 Since December 1999 only one Enron executive has reported buying company s hares The buyer was Andrew Fastow who was ousted during the week as Enron s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the company and Mr Fastow20 Mr Fastow reported purchasing 10000 Enron shares in August at 3698 each  or a total of 369800 Today those shares are valued at 163500 based on Enrons stock price of 1635 in 4 pm New York Stock Exchange composi te trading After the purchase Mr Fastow owned 110586 shares Thomson Fi nancialLancer Analytics says20 Enron said Mr Fastow wasnt available to comment20 On Monday a New York law firm filed suit in US District Court in Houston  alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr Fastow The s uit which seeks class-action status also says Enron insiders sold 73 mil lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 Copyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved 09 Credit Markets Enrons Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre dit-Rating Concerns By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10262001 The Wall Street Journal C15 Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc NEW YORK -- Enron Corps bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse20 Not for long some bond traders say In trading yesterday the Houston companys five-year bond a 250 million  issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 64 was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday and representing a 16 d rop during the past two weeks20 That is far less than the 50 decline in Enrons stock price since the Oct 16 disclosure of a 101 billion charge linked to soured investments resu lting in a 618 million third-quarter loss But the fall in the bonds pric e translates to a yield of 77 percentage points above bellwether US gove rnment bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two we eks ago Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit that kind of  spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl e B or lower20 Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than 1 billion on its bank credit l ines to shore up its finances Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline  investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds Yes terdays 82 bid for instance was for a block of less than 2 million in b onds a small percentage of a typical trade20 Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga tion and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer20 Even at these levels theres very little buying interest said Harold Ri vkin a principal at distressed-debt trader H Rivkin  Co in Princeton N J20 In one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect thems elves from losses on Enron debt was surging The cost of a default swap -- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac e value in the event of default -- rose to 10 of the size of the credit be ing insured That was up from 8 a day earlier and more than holders of Lu cent Technologies Inc debt had to pay at the height of that technology com panys troubles earlier during the year20 Even with its woes Enron remains an investment-grade company Most credit-rating agencies rate Enrons senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment-grade level20 Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enrons credit rating on watch for a possib le downgrade following a similar move by Moodys Investors Service last we ek Standard  Poors a division of McGraw Hill Cos stopped short of pu tting the company on its Creditwatch list opting instead to revise its lon g-term ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the companys f inancial flexibility20 Meanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis tressed levels said Glenn Reynolds an analyst at Credit Sights Inc an  independent fixed-income research firm in New York They arent distressed yet but they are headed in that direction20 If Enrons credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the c ompanys ability to raise money For an energy trader a credit downgrade s ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments20 Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities Though it is best known fo r trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in  the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacit y and steel As a market maker matching buyers and sellers Enron handles a bout a quarter of all the trading in the nations energy and gas markets 20 Enrons credit-worthiness is hugely important The better its credit rating  the cheaper it can hedge or offset its positions in all these commoditi es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers Without th at credit rating the cost of this high-margin high-volume business starts to rise A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to or derive d from that of an underlying security or asset such as a stock bond or c ommodity20 Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating the perceptio n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses s aid Mr Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc Any prudent risk manager at Enron s counterparties -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree ment with Enron -- is going to be examining their exposure to Enron and l ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it Mr Reynolds said20 To be sure Enron despite its recent woes remains a strong company credi t analysts said I dont think anyones seriously thinking that this is a  company that would ever default Mr Reynolds said20 So far our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s ticking with them said Ron Barone managing director of Standard  Poors utility energy project finance group No one has cut credit lines or aske d for additional collateral that we have identified And customers have pub licly stated that its business as usual20 Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could  make life more difficult for Enron and its management Traders expect Enron s new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to  make the rounds of Wall Street next week meeting with rating agencies deb t-trading desks big bond holders and banks including JP Morgan Chase   Co and Citigroup Inc20 Treasurys20 Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rat es more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that doc umented how weak the economy was after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks20 Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the weeks flood of Tre asury corporate and agency debt issues20 At 4 pm EDT the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 1332 point or  40625 per 1000 face value at 103 2032 Its yield fell to 4537 from 4 588 Wednesday as yields move inversely to prices20 The 30-year Treasury bonds price was up 2232 point at 101 1132 to yield  5284 down from 5330 Wednesday20 Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov 6 Also providing support for  longer maturities the Treasury Department made another repurchase of issue s outstanding It received offers for 504 billion in callable 30-year bon ds of which it accepted 1 billion The offer-to-cover ratio an indicatio n of demand was 50420 TREASURY BUYBACK Par Par High Wtd Avg Coupon Mat Amt Amt Accept Accept  Date Offer Accept Price Price 7125

Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10262001 The Wall Street Journal C1 Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc Enron Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about20 In recent years Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron even as they acknowledge n ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f or its soaring profits Now Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i ts most complicated transactions which many on Wall Street still cant fig ure out In a research note Wednesday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif ficult to value the company The companys lack of disclosure and transpar ency he says is a longstanding Enron hallmark20 So is this a stock to avoid in his view Hardly Goldman on Wednesday did  bump Enron off its US Select List which consists of a few dozen top st ock picks -- but Mr Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firms la rger but prestigious Recommended List of 200 or so favored stocks where  it has been since he joined Goldman in 199320 Just because I cant be specific in being able to create a simple model     doesnt mean that you write off that industry and say I cant analyze  it or I cant figure it out  says Mr Fleischer who owns an undisclos ed number of Enron shares If that were the case there would be an awful  lot of industries we couldnt follow20 Enrons shares have dropped about 50 since last week20 Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box says Jim Chanos principal of Kynikos Associates in New York  who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti ng from its fall -- throughout this year It was really a trust-me story  when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l evel of trust20 True no stock picker is immune from bad calls And Wall Street analysts lo ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had 20 But Enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still rec ommending the stock have acknowledged that the companys disclosure practic es are lacking Which raises the question How can an analyst recommend tha t others purchase a stock when key information about the companys operatio ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable20 Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business arent new Many of the issues now plaguing Enrons stock were first raised more than a year ago b y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts Yet time  and again Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger ing questions about the companys various partnership transactions20 Besides those partnerships Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings 20 Through it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli ng publicly dismissing questions about the firms accounting practices and level of disclosure As of yesterday of the 17 analysts who following the stock 10 had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according  to Thomson FinancialFirst Call Five others rated the stock a buy thoug h not strongly20 Only Prudential Securities which downgraded the stock this week has a se ll rating on Enron20 The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance despite what in retrospe ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante d20 Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Indexs general coll apse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part icularly those who like Goldmans Mr Fleischer own shares in the compani es they cover Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an d other revenue20 Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms For instance fo r one 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by Credit Suisse First Bost on Enron retained seven co-managers including Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette  Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch20 Enron is a big company and I dont think youre going to find a firm that hasnt been involved says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer  who still rates the stock a strong buy with a 40 price target They p ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street20 He adds We do our analysis every day based on the information we have Ar e we here strictly to defend companies Thats ludicrous Were here to pro vide information to investors    Yes I have the wrong recommendation o n the stock I dont think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p erformed20 Mr Fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small But he di sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised Mr Fleischer sa ys his clients are happy to know he has a stake in Enron because it show s he puts his money where his mouth is20 In his research note Wednesday Mr Fleischer called for complete disclosur es of Enrons off-balance sheet partnerships Despite the resulting difficu lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company  he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given Enron th e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position a s an industry leader20 Theres not information to really model this and be able to predict accura tely where revenues are going to come from and where theyre going to make  their money but every quarter they do he says Its hard to get inside  to know all the transactions but they do deliver20 CSFBs Mr Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasio nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press On Monday he wrote that he expects questions about Enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for Enron an d an ultimate recovery in the share price20 I know Im wrong on the stock Mr Launer says But he says that at these prices he isnt ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even  in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue  as much as 2 billion worth of shares diluting current holders -- the stoc k doesnt have much further to fall20 Clearly Messrs Launer and Flesicher arent alone Even in relative terms  analysts remain very bullish on this stock says Chuck Hill director of research at Thomson FinancialFirst Call The average rating for a stock o n Wall Street is 22 or slightly shy of a buy rating Enron scores a 16  This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out Mr Hill says20 In downgrading the stock this week Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i t to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold While she is the only  analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her rece nt downgrades come too little too late20 Ms Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years She says the co mpanys disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions For instance  she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission They said no  she says20 In light of the companys acknowledgment this week of an SEC inquiry she asked Enron about the previous denial They told me it is an inquiry not an investigation she says An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the SECs inquiry only last Wednesday Copyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved 09 Enron Draws Down 3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence 2001-10-26

Dollars 25bn pounds 1 8bn tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives20 The controversial package worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year s includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone It was approved by  the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214 but faces significant amen dment in the Senate which is now under Democrat control It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans who favour cor porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession and Democrats - who in a reprise of the Roosevelt new deal prefer to see i ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects20 Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 63bn  to the 14 biggest corporations - which they say are renowned for paying l ittle or no tax20 The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax or AMT introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments This strongly supported by President Bush would be mad e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded20 The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul ate that this would give a Dollars 14bn boost to computer group IBM alone while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll ars 671m20 Others to benefit include TXU the Texas-based utility that is the USs thi rd largest energy supplier which would would be given Dollars 608m United Airlines the USs second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive Dollars 371m and Enron the energy trading group forced t o sack its finance director this week would be given Dollars 254m20 Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis like other proposals to boost firms which include a 30 tax break for capi tal investment over three years worth Dollars 393bn this year alone They  say these amount to a giant corporate giveaway20 Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs and invest more prompting an economic recovery that at best is likely t o start in the new year20

C Harvey Pitts SEC From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy By FLOYD NORRIS 10262001 The New York Times Page 1 Column 2 c 2001 New York Times Company CAN the new friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy20 Harvey L Pitt the new SEC chairman set out this week to show that he  is not like his predecessor Arthur Levitt In a speech to the American Ins titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr Levitts  reform efforts -- Mr Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h is predecessor20 From now on he promised the commission will make sound decisions in a  respectful affirmative way not in a demeaning demanding or demonizing wa y He spoke favorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no  doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev en the worst profit figures look pretty There was no mention of Mr Levitt s concerns about improper management of earnings On the heels of Mr Pitts speech the SEC used a minor enforcement acti on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t o report their own errors The decision itself was reasonable although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a  fraud that went on for years But the way the SEC trumpeted it raised qu estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th an a guard dog Is this amnesty for financial fraud Jane Adams the ac counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former SEC staff me mber asked in a report to clients She was not sure of the answer20 In an interview yesterday Mr Pitt dismissed such worries No one is goi ng to get away with anything he said What we are trying to do is crea te an environment where people feel comfortable and can talk to the SEC  without feeling we are looking for a big splash20 A major embarrassment for accountants is having the SEC force a client t o restate its numbers Mr Pitt and his chief accountant Robert Herdman a re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made I am very much i n favor of a vigorous enforcement program Mr Pitt said in the interview  but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state ments and restatements20 Mr Pitt talks of companies getting it right the first time which woul d certainly be nice But there is a risk that companies will become more ag gressive in their accounting figuring there will be no real penalty like  a restatement if they are caught That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting20 In trying to sound comforting to the accountants group -- an organization  that as he noted he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr Pi tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence20 The proof of course will come in the performance Fortunately the mess a t Enron gives the SEC a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image I t will take time for the commission to determine if the companys accountin g was proper But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer 20 This could a former SEC staff member said focus the issue on whe ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur es And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a

Street This Week By KC Swanson mailtokcswansonthestreetcom Staff Reporter 10262001 0708 AM EDT URL httpwwwthestreetcommarketsdumbest10003035html TheStreetcom 1 United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest Rule No 1 in CEO school Never say that your company may soon collapse20 Seems kind of obvious but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J ames Goodwin who warned in a letter to employees that the company will pe rish next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses which have wors ened since the terrorist attacks Today we are literally hemorrhaging mon ey he wrote20 In raising concerns about the financial viability of United a unit of UAL  UALNYSE - news - commentary  Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about Since Sept 11 the airline has laid off about 200 00 of its 100000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25 Its expecte d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings20 But in response to the disclosure Goodwin has been roundly attacked Feeli ng that he had been all too honest investors have knocked an additional 24  off the stocks value The shares are down 54 since Sept 11 Meanwhile  UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations The leaders of one un ion have petitioned the companys board of directors to have him sacked20 Bottom line CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth but s ometimes it doesnt pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios either  Especially when that scenario is the companys own demise20 2 Forget the Victory Gardens Lets Have a Comfortable War20 Sure were at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an nihilation But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so me DVD players Maybe even a nice new car20 That was basically the message from the Treasury Department on news that C ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef forts and rebuilding following the attacks Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff The economy is per haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa r on global terrorists says Betsy Holahan a department spokesperson Wa r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism20 For the record we dont think an issue of war bonds would be dumb just su perfluous After all nothings stopped Americans from buying generic savin gs bonds -- or better yet Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t he federal government20 In the meantime its a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war  bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the  same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop War bo nds notwithstanding were a long way off from the era of ration books20 3 Enron Again Last week we noted the extent of alarm about Enrons ENENYSE - news - co mmentary revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped 12 billion  following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions  Following that disclosure besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the  company on whats delicately termed a leave of absence20 In July Fastow exited a limited partnership from which he had reportedly  reaped large profits after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol vement Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake  of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid ence20 But that wont be an easy task given the resentment about Enrons disincli nation to explain its problems One analyst called Fastows departure unse ttling noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the  day before Sounding a note of exasperation analysts at JP Morgan Chase Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock And th ere could be more trouble to come The Securities and Exchange Commission h as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions20 4 Gold Diggers20 Its understandable that investors felt panicky in September Unfortunately  some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds Accordin g to Financial Research Corp which tracks fund flows the specialty preci ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September  with net inflows of 101 million20 Granted thats not a huge sum in the mutual fund world By comparison dur ing the same month large growth funds saw net redemptions of 74 billion But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew orthy given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long20 Sure under the bizarre circumstances of late theyve enjoyed somewhat of  a pop According to Morningstar the average precious-metals fund is up 10 08 year to date But over the past five years the same category lost an e mbarrassing 1468 By comparison even large-cap growth funds -- everybody s favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return In the same  period they were up 71320 Moreover circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades -- a combination of attacks on the US government and war -- still dont  seem to have boosted gold prices significantly Despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks theyre again approaching their pre-Se pt 11 levels Its too early to say but its likely the gold bugs will co nfront disappointment once again20 5 Amazon Amazes Once Again Amazon AMZNNasdaq - news - commentary still maintains it will become pro fitable by the fourth quarter Well at least it will post a pro forma oper ating profit20 OK so maybe that wouldnt include Amazons service on 217 billion in lon g-term debt or extraordinary charges In fact a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy meaningle ss aura of minor triumph The company still hasnt said when it will turn a n economic profit20 For that matter even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy After announci ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit CFO Warren  Jenson added the humble qualifier There are no guarantees Amazon simult aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue predicting that s ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10 compared with a year ago 20 Third-quarter trends werent encouraging Though sales overall were up slig htly in the third quarter from a year ago revenue from the companys core  books and music business actually fell 12 At least the company has made p rogress in cutting costs A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses  have decreased by 20 over the past year20 Incidentally in the wake of Amazons earnings report two analysts made th e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock which has fallen 93  from its high back in December 1999 Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to

Enron Corp drew down about 3 billion the bulk of its available bank credit lines in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt h and liquidity Fridays Wall Street Journal reported20 Enron ENE will use part of the money to offer to redeem around 185 bill ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi ng to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks  about a new multibillion-dollar credit line Some observers thought the mov es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit y should its access to bank lines be interrupted Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong But when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f ew days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank sa id an Enron spokesman In a prepared statement the companys new chief fin ancial officer Jeff McMahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than  adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme nts20 The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days Enron is the nations largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec tricity and natural-gas trades Thursday for example Enron was involved i n about 4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit20 Since early last week Enrons share price has plummeted 50 It has report ed a 618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity  of 12 billion It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di d with entities run by its former chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow  who was replaced Wednesday20 The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency Fitch  put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard  Poors chang ed Enrons credit outlook to negative from stable Moodys Investors Servic e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade In order to fall  below investment grade Enrons credit rating would have to fall several no tches20 If that were to happen however a host of bad consequences could follow T ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price a noninvestment grade ra ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings In that event Enron could be forced to issue mi llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt diluting the value of ex isting shares As of 4 pm in New York Stock Exchange

Business Writer 10252001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001 The Associated Press All Rights Reserved NEW YORK AP - As it grew over the past decade into the countrys largest  natural gas and power marketing company Enron Corp became the de facto ba rometer of health within the energy trading sector20 Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enrons competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houston-based companys business model Now execu tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enrons internal tumult and fre e-falling stock price from undermining investors confidence in the sector They say the Houston-based companys problems should be viewed in isolatio n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was  yesterday a week ago or a month ago said Jim Donnell president of Duke  Energy North America a division of Duke Energy Corp that generates and tr ades power20 That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In c El Paso Corp and Duke Energy Corp rebounded from losses on Wednesday when Enrons latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i ts rivals20 Enrons stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week and nearly 80 p ercent since January and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim e soon20 The latest troubles began Oct 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning s and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n ot entirely forthcoming only got worse20 First came reports that some of the companys losses stemmed from partnersh ips managed by Enrons chief financial officer at the time Andrew Fastow  That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission20 Then on Wednesday one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow  the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence20 They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didnt come through with flying colors said Christopher Ellingh aus an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York20 Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old which have little to do with the companys wholesale energy business which accounts  for roughly 80 percent of profits20 Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices 20 Even though Enron shot themselves in the foot the basic business is sti ll sound and not likely to disappear Ellinghaus said20 UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment20 The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o verdone Barone said20 On Thursday Williams Companies Inc of Tulsa Okla reported net income o f 760 million and Reliant Resources Inc of Houston reported 133 million  in profits20 Its business as usual said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel20 Not for Enron whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when  its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype The dow nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from  power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign20 On Oct 16 Enron reported a net loss of 638 million in the third quarter taking a one-time charge of 101 billion attributed to investment losses troubled assets and unit restructurings Excluding the charge Enron earne d 393 million on 476 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep t 3020 Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enrons competitors were brought down Wednesd ay because of dire speculation that Enrons troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy20 All Im hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality Ellin ghaus said20 Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday20 Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte NC-based company is paying clo se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o f receivables not being paid20 They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit he said Theyve

Enrons Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by SP Update1 Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph Houston Oct 25 Bloomberg -- Enron Corps long-term credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by Standard  Poors after the largest energy traders shares fell 49 percent in the past week SP affirmed the Houston-based companys ratings of BBBA2 which are investment grade The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the possibility that Enron wont generate enough money from selling assets outside the main trading business to repay debt SP did say that the strategic direction of the company is likely to become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management changes Enron reported 101 billion in losses from investments outside the principal business of trading commodities such as electricity and natural gas Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow resigned yesterday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission asks for information about related-party transactions he conducted The SP write up was very positive said Dorothea Matthews an analyst at CreditSights Inc a research firm It seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and calm things down Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to 1635 --Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom 609-750-4651 or Enrons Trading Partners Say Its Business as Usual Update2 2001-10-25 1938 New York Enrons Trading Partners Say Its Business as Usual Update2 Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph Houston Oct 25 Bloomberg -- Concerns Enron Corp will run short on cash havent prevented commodities traders from doing business with the largest energy broker customers say The company handles about 25 percent of US power and natural-gas trading said John Kilduff vice president of energy risk management for Fimat USA Its also a leader in complex derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of fluctuating commodities prices Enrons credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at Moodys Investors Service and Standard  Poors lowered Enrons long-term credit outlook to negative after 101 billion in third-quarter losses from some soured investments The company needs good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions So far there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is handling less business Kilduff said If they were unable to perform it would be a major problem he said It could get like Long-Term Capital if things really broke down because the numbers are that big Long-Term Capital Management a private investment fund for the wealthy incurred massive losses making bond trades during the 1998 Russian currency crisis The funds portfolio plunged More than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of 36 billion to avoid a collapse Needs Cash Daily Enron trades electricity natural gas coal and other commodities worldwide as well as complex financial instruments to hedge against price swings in the goods As of now Enron is active in the markets Kilduff said No one is cutting trading lines that I can see or demanding different terms than before Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every day to settle positions said Kilduff whose company swaps natural gas and other energy investments with Enron Some days Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall while Enron bets that they will rise Natural gas usually does one or the other every day and someone pays the difference The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor Kilduff said Someone is paying someone else every day Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough money to operate normally and can fall back on 34 billion in bank credit lines if necessary The company is determined to protect the credit rating Enron has said We arent even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at this point said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne Investor Questions Enron based in Houston ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow yesterday two days after the US Securities and Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he ran that invested in company shares Those trades cost Enron 35 million Jeff McMahon head of Enrons industrial markets unit replaced Fastow who went on leave of absence Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week They fell 6 cents to 1635 today Based on Bloomberg composite ratings most of Enrons long-term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1 two or three levels above investment grade Fitch Standard  Poors and Moodys all rate the companys debt at investment grade The company also faces questions from investors about 33 billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to meet them by selling assets Enron doesnt know if the sale proceeds will cover the debt The company would have to make good on any shortfall Little Time Enron asked Citicorp Inc on Tuesday to arrange a 750 million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut out of the money markets Enron had about 185 billion of commercial paper or short-term unsecured debt outstanding as of Tuesday traders said The company which has a 3 billion program has had difficulty finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC investigation was announced the traders said Today Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent yield 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough time to get their house in order said Jon Kyle Cartwright senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James  Associates Theres a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so they have less time than they think to pacify the market Ripple Effect Some investors are concerned that Enrons complex book of hedges swaps options and other derivative contracts involves so many partners participants and companies that a failure would pose a risk to the economy and force a bailout like Long-Term Capital Managements The talk in the financial markets is that some counter party to Enron could fail if Enron cant perform said Jeff Caughron manager of 400 million in investments for Tinker Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City If it goes down there could be a big ripple effect The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron wont be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine Corp Dynegy Inc Mirant Corp and NRG Inc said Chris Ellinghaus an analyst at Williams Capital Group As a group shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are fueling a sell-off he said Both traders and companies selling power to Enron are suffering All four companies said theyre trading with Enron as they have in the past Market Maker Enron supplies services some customers consider irreplaceable The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges weather risk through Enron said risk manager Jim Tracy The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate at peak efficiency and capacity in dry seasons when the dams cant operate as well Enron pays the district If Enrons credit went bad or they folded up that agreement wouldnt get picked up by someone else Tracy said Enron also helps many US utilities protect themselves from electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little rainfall Any impairment on Enrons part to continue doing so would trickle down to Main Street utilities Tracy said Utilities would start reserving more on their balance sheets for price swings Tracy said --Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651 or at Enron Broadband Begins Closing London Singapore Offices By Erwin Seba Of DOW JONES

tradin g partner Enron Corp ENE Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc e call And the company hasnt been contacted by the state of California ab out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the company signed with the state earlier this year20 Calpines diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share  compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year Setting Calpines co nsistent earnings growth aside Wall Street analysts in Thursdays conferen ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry li ke Enron California and whether the US will have a surplus of electric  power stations in a few years Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t o Enron20 We continue to assess the situation but right now dont have any net expo sure to Enron said Calpines vice president of corporate risk management Paul Pasoli We continue to trade with them We will adjust our credit th reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating20 When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha lted immediately Pasoli said that in fact Calpine would owe Enron a litt le money20 In another energy industry area of concern Calpine was asked about the sta te of Californias stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of long-term power contracts Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th an when California bought this past winter and spring20 Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont racts In general we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t o do so as well said Calpine cheif executive Peter Cartwright If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win we would be  happy to look at that if California asks Weve done that many times20 As for future power prices Calpine said that its going forward with its p rogram to build a portfolio of 70000 megawatts of generation which is abo ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7 of all US capac ity The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d ifference between natural gas prices and power prices and Calpine said tha t difference or spark spread has grown the past few months Furthermore  the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr ojects generate an after-tax return of 18 on the investment20 As a result the company expects earnings to grow at least 40 annually thr ough 2005 Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w ont issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially20 -By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires 201-938-4604 markgoldendowjonesco m Copyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc

you just wont get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement And with the job market these days there might come a time when I cant continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a decision   Id lower my giving so that the total contribution was level year after year  If and when you decided to stop Id have to start making up the difference again to keep my seats on row 3  Or Id be bumped somewhere I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets -
