Message-----From 	Dewar Donette Sent	Friday September 28 2001 254 PM To	Locklear Essie Cc	Vasconcellos Brent Subject	Raptor unwind tax accounting Essie The purpose of this message is to communicate to you for co-ordination with the appropriate MARC personnel the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday September 28 to unwind the Raptor structures  As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close I thought it might make sense for you with Brents assistance to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions Each of the top tier Raptor entities Harrier Roadrunner Pronghorn and Grizzly purchased from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the bottom tier Raptor entities Talon Bobcat Porcupine and Timberwlf respectively  Harrier paid 6 mil Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid 15 mil and Pronghorn paid 1000  As a result of these transactions the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron Also as a result of these transactions a total book loss of around 600 mil was recorded divided among the books of each one of the four structures For tax purposes the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp or EES in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine  The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp or EES as the case may be on a contingent debt instrument  Accordingly the entire book loss should be reversed for tax and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity  For examply Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for 6 mil We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities books  Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10  Thanks DMD
