On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.

The only thing I'd like to add is the Quantum purchase for November is 1,000 Mcf not MMBtu.  We are showing a 967 btu factor so it would be 967 MMBtu at the wellhead less fuel.

Any additional gas would be under imbalance between Crestone and Quantum.

Thanks.
Theresa

Subject:	OBA Imbalance Sheet

Scott & Walt:

A couple of things...I talked to Theresa today and the OBA Spreadsheet (or actually,  Enron's imbalance sheet) needs to be changed for both October and November as follows:

October:

ENA purchased 300 mmbtu/d from Westport  at the Bear Paw point beginning October 9.  We need to add a column on the ENA sheet (i.e. similar to Phillips) showing that 300 mmbtu.
Quantum - ENA did not purchase any gas from Quantum for October.  We had some measurement of gas from Quantum throughout the month.  This needs to go to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone.

November:

ENA is purchasing 1,000 mmbtu/d from Quantum.  If Quantum produces more than 1,000 mmbtu/d that extra goes to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone.
ENA is not purchasing Westport's gas at this time.

I would be happy to make these changes, but I am unsure as to how this file affects your Meter Allocation report and I don't want to mess that one up!!!  

I'm copying Theresa on this memo....please feel free to add to it if I missed something.  

Thanks.

Megan,
I'm not sure why this is showing up.....I think it must have something to do with the name change from Enron Midstream to Crestone....

Let me pull out my Oct 00 file and see what invoice # we finalized then because I'm pretty sure they paid us.

I'll try and get to this later today.

Thanks,

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Megan,
Here are the producers for November for the Powder River system.  I don't have Lost Creek yet - hopefully before you leave.

Please call me if you see any problems.

There will be no sales invoice this month for Crestone and I've told this to Scott Dozier.

I will get the gathering to Gloria tomorrow.

Thanks again,

Theresa

(P.S. - you'll have to give me your new # so we can keep in touch)

Can you tell me who would handle the Enserco and Millenium sales?  Laurie I know you do the Retex sale.

It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet.

The formula BP is using is highlighted in red below. After I inquired about the discrepancy, my counterpart at BP emailed her trader who talked to Paul Lucci. Apparently, BP is using the correct pricing. I just faxed copies of the invoices to you.

	Janice-

	Good morning.  I have a price discrepancy for deal 120644/120643,
Anschutz Plant, for 8/01 and 9/01 (and if it is not corrected, we could have
a discrepancy for as long as the deal lasts, until 4/02).  Enron is showing
the rate to be Inside FERC NWPL Rockies + $0.02 less $0.09 (Mcf conversion).
In ET Deal our formula is (NWPL Rocky Mountains IF) + .02 - ((1.022-.995) *
(Kern Wyoming IF)).

	Can you please verify who is correct, and if Enron's rate is
correct, can you please make the changes for 8/01, 9/01 and the continuing
months in the deal?  If we are correct, can you please talk to your
counterpart at Enron to see about getting this resolved this month?  My
counterpart and I would both like to have this rate discrepancy cleared this
month.

	Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank
you for all your help.

	Thanks-

Green Bay, WI:
Green Bay Packers football practice was delayed on Wednesday for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Head Coach Mike Sherman immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate.
After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually the goal line.
Practiced resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not likely to encounter the substance again.

Gee Thanks Barry!! 
 
You know I must say it's been a while since the Packers have had to worry about beating the Bears.  It's kind of fun to see an old rivalry back again.  The Bears are pretty good this year and if the game was in Green Bay I would really bet on the Packers but I'm just gonna hope they can beat them in Chicago.  I hope we'll get the game here in Denver.
 
GO PACK GO........

FYI

Lisa Finley just called me to let me know that Devon Operators need to take Beaver Creek down tomorrow for 8 hours.  They apologize for the short notice, but said if they don't fix the cooler now it will bring the whole system down soon.  

We will be short by about 6,500 on the 005 contract for Gas Day 4 and I guess we'll have to work at paying it back.


That's all I have to say .....about that.

Mark,
I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  

I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.

I'll keep you posted.

Thersa,
I recalculated the August invoice and I am still coming up with a difference
between your invoice and my calculations.  The difference for August is
$18,713.96.  I am issuing a adjustment for the $18,713.96.  So, when the
funds are transferred to Enron, there will be two transactions that will net
$794,486.45.  
Also, I am not paying the additional $10,210.77 PPA for July.  When you
revise July's invoice, I will pay based on the revised invoice.  
I will take the invoices down to Accounting tomorrow after they have been
approved.  John is out today, but will be back in the office tomorrow.  I
will try to expedite payment tomorrow.
Can you please forward this to Valerie?  


Robert

Robert, Valerie,

I have revised the fuel percent from .0107 to .0078.  Please call me if
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

(I will start working on correcting all prior months and get an
adjustment out soon.)

It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet. 

Are you out any time from now until the end of the month?

Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no reason.

We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  

I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush us.

We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.

And by the way - where's our $60?????

Gloria,
Is there any way you could copy and send overnight to me the CIG invoices for the 33175000 contract from May, 2000 through January, 2001?

I am helping Darla and Megan reconcile the Citizens account.  It is changing over to Kinder Morgan effective Dec. 1 and we need to reconcile this account rather quickly.

I printed all other invoices on the Internet from CIG's website but they only go back 9 months.

Let me know if this is possible or where else I might find these.

Thanks,

Alan,
I'm not sure that our purchase is equivalent to the $1.55 purchase but I assumed you received an e-mail from Amy Felling in our office.

Here's the September purchase for September.  Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

Accounting has received a wire that they are now looking for backup.
Their initial review indicates that the pricing seems low.  I know that
pricing is pretty pitiful, but Gas Daily monthly average for Sept was
about $1.55 per MM.  Please forward the backup today if possible so we
can review.  Thanks............

Please check Devon SFS deal 933399 on KNE for 8/01.  We paid them for 8,000 on 8/30, but I am now seeing 8,000 on the 31st.  Do we need to pay for the 31st?  Deal 933399 does not have day 31 for KNE, so the volume is not pulling into settlements.  I see the extra 8,000 in volume management.  If it needs to be paid, we will need to add the day to the deal.

Gloria,
Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  

I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.

Let me know ,
Theresa

I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a "paid invoices" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.

I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gloria,
Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  

I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.

Let me know ,
Theresa

There is an interconnect between WIC and FUGG for 09/01.  The WIC # ties to the
statement.  Can you please check the FUGG # ?  
Right now, I have some extra time.  I would love to help you guys with this imbalance.
Could I take a look at 08/01?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

It's 10:10 our time and I didn't see the fax yet.  I wasn't sure what time you sent it.  

I have to take the kids to finish our shopping for the kids name drawing and we'll be done too.  We got Sierra an outfit from Old Navy - and I think she'll like it.

Hi Theresa,
I just faxed 2 maps for you for you from the SF airport to our house.  Let me know if you get them ok. Any questions ask Dad this weekend.

We went shopping last night and found the Battleship game for Landon and our Old Navy store didn't have the pants in black with orange stripe so I got him gray with green stripe. We found a really cute outfit for Kayla at Mervyns. It's a beautiful blue velour pants set.  Now, I'm just waiting for the Bronco lamps to get here.  Penny's called the other day and said we should have them in 4-5 days.  I sure hope so!

Love,
Mom	PS:  I got you email on the air fare prices, I'll check later & see.

Hi Carole,
The Kennedy deal is effective December 1, 2001.  Paul Lucci said we're gonna need to all get together before we enter the deals.  He did not say when that would be.  I would assume this week sometime.

Megan,

Congratulations on your new job!  I certainly understand you leaving.  I really enjoyed working with you and I'll hate to see you go (At least before the rest of us get let go).

Amy was let go last Friday here along with another guy.  It's only Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself left.

I am working on the November producers today as a matter of fact.  I am hoping to complete them today or tomorrow morning.

I have a walk through on my new house tomorrow afternoon and could possibly be moving on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise it'll be next Thursday.  I wanted to get all of this out of the way before my move.

I'll get busy now and hopefully email you later today.

Thanks,
Theresa

Theresa/Amy:
I just wanted to let you know that I have given two weeks notice.  I need a little more stability in my work environment.  My last day at Enron will be 12/26 and I'm taking a vacation day on 12/21.  I'm telling you this because I want to be able to complete the November Powder River and Lost Creek deals before I go.  I know we probably won't be paying anybody, but at least they will be reflected correctly in the system.  It would be great if I could have the files by the 18th or 19th.

Also,  please look at Howell for Oct 2001.  I see some volume reversing in the system.

I hope everything worked out Okay with your rent.

Hi Theresa,

I just got through redrafting for October to pull in the new storage volumes and prices. It looks like there are three new demand charges. I don't really understand since the last email you sent said you had to reduce the demand charge. If these demand charges are valid then we would need to send out a revised manual invoice. Let me know either way.

Thanks!

I just now opened my e-mail (7:30)  - I've been trying to figure out where you were because I saw the capacity reports and the Gas Daily.  I thought you left to go get breakfast.  DARN!.
 
I hope you feel better.   I wouldn't worry about coming in today.  Ty needs to work on our model before we could start anything anyway.

Hello All,

The final payment of 1,937200 is in Sitara on Ticket #1087272.  I understand we will draft this for September and Jim Pond will re-classify since we've already manually paid.

Let me know if you see any problems with this.

Thanks.
Theresa

Thanks,

Theresa,

I got your Lloyds stuff in - let me know how I can get it to you.  If you
want, I can bring it in to work and maybe we can have lunch or something.  I
will be out on Friday, but any other day is fine.

Thanks,

Steph

I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gloria,
Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  

I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.

Let me know ,
Theresa

There is an interconnect between WIC and FUGG for 09/01.  The WIC # ties to the
statement.  Can you please check the FUGG # ?  
Right now, I have some extra time.  I would love to help you guys with this imbalance.
Could I take a look at 08/01?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

Gloria,
Amy Felling here is working on current month and I'll continue on prior month variances.  We'll let you know the status of current month by tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks,

Theresa - here's the latest by month of the imbalance.  Please let me know if
there is any way that I can help you.  Could I look at current month, while you
look at the past stuff?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria
