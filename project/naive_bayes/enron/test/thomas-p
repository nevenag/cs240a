Thomas Paul DSent Items X-Origin THOMAS-P X-FileName paul d thomas 6-26-02PST Well Aaron It is great to hear that you are doing well Yes Raquel and I  the same gal I was dating at Genesis ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio  We got married in small church on the Lagoa quite a beautiful place to get married  Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us  My parents family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood   I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank  We are now considering paying it off however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there Therefore not sure if we really want to pay it off As far as children go we are still waiting for the right time  I imagine we will have one in a year or so right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 12 due to the terrorist attacks  Not such a bad place to be stuck  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there  It is different from most great cities in the world  For example Paris Rome London NYC are all famous for the great buildings etc however Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see as far as a city settings go  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea  It is the cidade maravillosa Take care and have a great Christmas

Enron treating you well I hope Yeah we moved to Lyon at the beginning of 2000  When looking at a map of our solar system Lyon is practically in the center of France  Were more or less located at the foot of the French Alps  At about a million people Lyon is smaller than Houston Because of the Internet Boom my Internet investments appreciated enough to buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the city  Weve been renovating it ever since  Ive learned a hell of a lot about working on homes Before David Underwood got fired he told me that you got married and bought a house in or near Linkwood off Stella Link  I imagine you married that young Brazilian lady that you were dating while at Genesis  Flicitations Have you been to Brazil  Id like to see it one day if ever the opportunity presents itself  Since youre hitched now I guess you are obligated to have children soon  So yes since the 22nd of September Ive been the proud father of a baby girl -- Camille  Shes a real angel and quite a character too read rascal  I hope Enron allows you to receive e-mail attachments that are not work related because Ive attached a photo of her that is as recent as tonight  Shes got brown eyes like her mommy I heard you went to NYC  How did you like it  I love NYC and I was just there one week ago  No matter how many times I go there I will never run out of things to do  This last time I saw an exhibit on Brazil at the Guggenheim  There are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that Ive not seen so I know I will return  Actually I ponder the idea of getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little American culture for six months at a time NYC is only six hours from Paris  Since Camille is American I think this would be good for her  Of course the problem is the price of an apartment  Its bloody expensive mate  Stress BLOODY  I asked one agency and they told me 450000 for a studio apartment in a nice area on Manhattan I dont know how accurate this off-the-cuff quote was  Thats a little too much for me unless I get a mortgage which I horror the idea of owing any bank money  Perhaps something cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood  You know the ones with ugly whores hanging around every small street intersection  Then theres Harlem maybe I can get a pad next to Clintons June 10th 2000 we got married for a second time  The marriage was in France and all my in-laws attended as well as my mother and aunt too  They my mother and aunt were a little shocked to say the least  They speak no French and were like fish out of water to say the least  But you didnt hear this from me Ive tons of little day-to-day stories that are worth a laugh but this e-mail covers all the big stuff thats been happening Best Regards Aaron This e-mail is the property of Genesis Business Management Systems Inc andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole

in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTON--BUSINESS WIRE--Jan 30 2002--The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants which could represent part of the answer to worlds power generation needs over the next 30 years has taken a few steps forward in the consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months However nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental groups and those involved with post-Chernobyl public health concerns The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR from Eskom in South Africa continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and appropriate Stakeholders in the project include the US company Exelon with 125 Eskom with 30 British Nuclear Fuels with 225 Industrial Development Corporation of SA with 25 and Black empowerment at 10 Currently Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of 40 PBMRs at a price of around 6 billion USD Early in 2001 the company requested the US National Regulatory Commission to start laying the groundwork for PBMR licensing Exelon would like to see the 300 million demonstration unit which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model to show that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety efficiency and viability are proven enough for US regulatory agencies to proceed forward with licensing The plant is to be built alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape Province of South Africa with work commencing in 2003 If approved Exelon may then start concurrent construction of US sites to bring PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at the best price Specifications and claims by Eskom who purchased the technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany present the PBMR as small safe clean cost efficient inexpensive and adaptable The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere 60mm in diameter The PBMR design makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closed cycle gas turbine and generator The design differences between the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a safe and economical power plant The annual world market for power generation is estimated at 70 billion The PBMR if it comes through its regulatory trials would be in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action With 10 of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black empowerment shareholders 10 plant export orders a year could contribute nearly 1 billion a year to South Africas Gross Domestic Product and another 1 billion in export income An estimated 57000 direct and indirect jobs would be created These figures would double and triple for 20 or 30 orders annually If the demo plant achieves its targets Eskom will place an order for 10 modules with the Exelon order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the first US plant in 2007 Eskom will sell PBMRs as a manufactured item with no rights given Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured reactor and 20 site construction related The aim is for 40 of the sourcing to come from South Africa Taxpayers money approximately 50 million so far is being spent by the South African authorities in giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the project before the go decision is given With this right and proper concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the 130MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of nuclear power generation The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a significant move A contract has been placed in mid-January 2002 with the US company Stone  Webster and South African construction company Murray  Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project in engineering procurement construction management and project management Following this development the PBMR management at Eskom have gone on record to state that with the multi-national and multi-disciplinary support now providing leverage the approval hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of 2002 given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the government Industrailinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy and industrial markets For

Weekly Update 6801 Attached FYI is the weekly update prepared by the NYISO In addition sever al noteworthy actions were taken at Wednesdays Management Committee meetin g ICAP Culminating an 18-month effort that I have been chairing the MC gave final approval to two fundamental changes to NYs ICAP market that if ap proved by FERC would go into effect on Nov1 2001 with the start of the  winter capability period The first changes the nature of determining the p roduct to be bought and sold from one based on tests results ICAP to one  that includes as an element a units forced outage rate referred to as u nforced capacity or UCAP The design adopted by NY is very similar to the  accreditation system that has been used in PJM for many years  It will rew ard units that are more available than the average unit in the state and i ncent the below average units to improve their availability The second maj or change adopted moves NY to a monthly procurement requirement for loads  The current requirement is six months at a time The change should facilita te customer switching under retail access programs and avoid the experience just witnessed in upstate NY for this summer capability period where 1400 MW of load were deficient and got stuck paying a huge deficiency price for the entire six month period Under the revised program load could cover t heir positions month by month This latter change was approved by the MC ov er the objections of the PSC and certain utilities who continued to argue  that any change to the current ICAP rules may damage NYs reliability20 Penalty and Public Disclosure Provisions In a surprise vote the PSC-led e ffort to get the MC to approve additions to the ISOs Market Mitigation Pla n that would add penalty and public disclosure provisions for parties whose bids are mitigated by the ISO was defeated when only 55 voted for the mea sure A 58 vote is required for passage An earlier version of the propo sal had been passed by the MC but had been rejected by the ISO Board becaus e it applied only to suppliers and not to all market participants found to  engage in behavior detrimental to the market The PSC-led effort to respond to the Boards concerns apparently caused enough supporters of the origina l version to change their vote this time around Whether this effort is res urrected again by the PSCutilities or the Board itself may hinge on what FERC decides with respect to the circuit breaker proposal pending before F ERC The ISO Board has made clear it wants something in effect this summer  to help it  manage price spikes Unbundling of Schedule 1 Charges Efforts to finalize the unbundling of the ISOs fixed schedule 1 charges nearly 100 million a year were sent back to a working group for further work However the direction to be taken fo r some issues appears clear20 TCCs We succeeded in convincing the group that no costs should be assigned to existing TCCs and that if costs are to be assigned to this market the y should be allocated on the basis of the relative price paid for the TCCs  compared to the annual auction revenues rather than on the basis of number of TCCs purchased Exports and Wheelthroughs We succeeded in getting a separate category crea ted for these transactions that will result in MWH costs that are much le ss than what is currently charged Conversely there is now likely to be a  small charge on imports into NY however since all generation will be hit  with this charge it should be reflected in everyones bids equally and sim ply passed on to the loads through the market clearing price The exact amount of these various charges will depend on resolution of a nu mber of issues including whether the TOs should be assessed a portion of th e ISOs overhead right off the top ----- Forwarded by Howard FromerNAEnron on 06082001 0200 PM -----09kkranznyisocom Sent by owner-nyisobiclistsnyisocom 06082001 12 46 PM 09   To marketrelationsnyisocom  cc   Subject NYISO -
