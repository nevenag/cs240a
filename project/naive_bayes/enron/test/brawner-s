httpcbsmarketwatchcomnewsdefaultasp More Headlines httpcbsmarketwatchcomheadlinesheadlinesaspsource WASHINGTON CBSMW -- As Enron and Dynegy await approval from regulators on the companies proposed 9 billion merger Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay finds himself in an enviable position Lays employment agreement with Enron which is set to expire Dec 31 2005 allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to 808 million according to a regulatory filing Tuesday httpcbsmarketwatchcomtoolsquotesintchartaspsymbENE According to the terms of the employment contract if Lay quits before a change of control at the company he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by 202 million The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an excess parachute payment according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing Lays original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned Enrons

Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject	Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning  Here are my notes  Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements  Watson spoke for c 10 minutes Bergstrom for 5 and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred  If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be 45 Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true  Dynegy owed Enron 50MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps 30MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the off-balance-sheet structures including the credit-linked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible  However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its 364-day facility believe this is the 3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next 6-8 weeks BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office  trading books will need to be combined at closing  EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there  The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded non-core assets  Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT 100 sure that no surprises remain in Enrons books--but that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses  Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops 35Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at 090-095 which represents a 25 haircut to Enron internal estimates  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively short-term in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5 discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices  ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better  No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these
