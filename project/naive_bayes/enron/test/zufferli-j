implementation of the Automated Dispatch Messaging System ADMS from the Power Pool of Alberta is proceeding on schedule however the processes for implementation and training are changing slightly as described below The purpose of this memo is to inform all of the participants who have been contacted for the implementation of ADMS of the processes over the next few weeks and the requirements for the implementation at your dispatch locations Beginning the week of July 2 2001 and continuing through July 13 2001 Power Pool staff will be contacting you individually to provide you with your username and password and ensure that you are able to log into the web site  This initial web site will be on a development system that is not connected to the active market system  This will enable participants to log onto the system to become familiar with the screens and user features as well as receive test dispatches Beginning the week of July 16 2001 the Power Pool will turn off the development system web server and transfer to the active market system  The System Controller area will contact each participant and walk you through the screens and answer any questions that you may have regarding use of the system  Once you are familiar with the system through this conversation future active dispatches will then be provided over the ADMS system  The sequential addition of participants to the system will enable the orderly transfer from the voice dispatch process to the automated process with a minimum of disruption in the dispatch process The above process changes the manner in which training will be provided  In reviewing the user screens we believe that participants will be able to understand how to use the system simply by having access to the system prior to the implementation  If there is any difficulties encountered using the system the System Controllers will be available to assist you with any questions as your users begin to use the dispatch system The majority of you have indicated that your computer equipment is in place and that you are ready to start implementation  If you are unable to start the implementation process on July 2 2001 please let the Power Pool contact know and he will arrange to schedule your user names passwords and access closer to July 16 2001 The implementation of digital certificates to enhance the security of the system will be delayed for a short period of time to enable a newer and simpler digital certificate system  We believe that by implementing without the digital certificates fewer implementation problems will be encountered and will also simplify the digital certificate installation process with users at a later date  Our implementation of username and password protection combined with server certification provides adequate security in the short term before the digital certificates are incorporated As we discussed the system provides audible alerts for the users when a dispatch is received  I am attaching six files that contains audible alert sounds for you to load on your computers  To install these wav files on your computers create a folder CPPOAadminsounds and copy these files to the new folder  Your internet browser will then use these files for the audible alerts that are provided by the system  You can review this with the person who will be contacting you with usernames and passwords if there is difficulty implementing these alert sounds As the implementation portion of the ADMS project moves to the operational area of the Power Pool contact points with the Power Pool will change Effective immediately would you please use the following contact names for work on the ADMS implementation Primary contact Jack Kelly 403 233-6410 jackkellypowerpoolabca
