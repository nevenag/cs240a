What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.  

Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the rumors have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not sure how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger will get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As far as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will be interesting.

Have fun over Thanksgiving.

I hung out

it.  I'll
	   have to look for it up here.  We went to the APB party, but
left early
	   to get some food.  Things calmed down that last night
compared to
	   Tuesday.

	   I'll be back on days at the end of next week and then I'll
have two

Thanksgiving?  I'm
	   flying to San Antonio to visit my dad for a few days.  I
can't decide
	   whether to stop over in Houston or just wait until Christmas.
I feel so
	   lucky that the shift I'm on has the holidays off.

	   I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  I
lost my
	   voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade.
Needless
	   to say, they sent me home to get better.  I secretly think
everyone was
	   happy not to hear me talk!  :o)  It was so strange because
other than
	   the loss of my voice, I felt fine.  Who knows?

	   Have a great week!  Hopefully we can talk when I get in the
office on
	   Thursday.

	   about 3

weekend,

the band

but it
	   was

	   You need

Halloween

Julie,

As I am getting off night shift today, I will be unable to attend the HR presentation.  I believe I filled out all of the necessary paperwork (W-4, direct deposit, and employment application) to get started and I dropped the beneficiary and benefits paperwork on your desk this morning.  Please write me if there is anything else that you need from me.

Cara,

Alicia @ Dynegy ultimately decided to cut this schedule as per my call with her at 16:54 PPT
I notified Karen of this cut at 16:55
and Steve @PPM @ 17:21, (because he called me)

Karen maintains that stateline energy is delivered to Grant's Interconnect and not to a valid Mid C delivery point.
I gave Alicia BPA (T) and WWP (T) as valid wheels to deliver, but she had already decided to cut and L & D upstream (ulitmately PSCO)


I had a long conversation w/
Matt (Pacificorp)
Steve (PPM)
and Karen (Chelan)
-We talked mainly about the reliability of the energy and the details of the path, but nobody offered a viable solution.  I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.

Note:
Steve (PPM) asked me @ 17:21 if Chelan still wants the energy ( I didn't know and Karen is gone at this time)

Call me with any question,
Craig

Amy, 
Thank you for my birthday card.  I really appreciate it.  I'm sorry, but I've been meaning to call you.  I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.

Clint

Mike,
We need to know the volumes of their load and how it is broken down.  This would include location (by zone), ramp rates, and load factors.  Also, we need to know how fast the load can react to instructions, and how flexible the load is, i.e. can the load be moved up and down on an interval basis without causing problems?  We would also need to know their load forecast.  For example, when is the load available to be reduced, summers, on-peak, etc.?  Obviously if this is limited, we would want to value it accordingly.

Thanks,
Clint

Jennifer,
I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't get to meet up the second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out again on Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I missed you.  Talk to you soon.

As of October 1 we need to be especially careful in using non-firm transmission right only.  Make sure to repeat transmission requests with the BPA as "non-firm on Enron all the way".  Mistakes may cost as much as  $1200/mw if you agree to use Enron's firm rights.  

Also note that some of BPA's network transmission fees have increased by $2.

Hello all!

Jon Koomey, the instructor for your Tricks of the Trade (Energy Math) course, has requested participant feedback regarding his class. If you have any comments or suggestions, please e-mail Jon at numbers@numbersintoknowledge.com and copy me as well.

For your convenience, I have included questions from other course evaluations to help guide your thoughts. Feel free to include other comments or suggestions.

Was the presentation of information clear and at the right level of detail?  Did the presenter keep the course interesting?
For a course held entirely in one day, the level of detail was effective.  The course was interesting with the real life examples and the challange problem solving in groups.  The visual aids could use some improvement.  I have no specific ideas, but I found the consistent nature of the material to create a lull in the presentation.
Were there any topics discussed that you would have liked greater detail on?
Current events.  I liked the bit on the Kyoto Treaty
Were there any topics covered that you did not find beneficial or relevant?
I've systematically erased them from my memory...too late to recall
Were there any topics that you would have liked information on that were not included in the seminar?
Currency conversions as they relate to production costs
Did you find the group and individual exercises useful?  Do you have any changes or recommendations for the exercises that you would have found more beneficial?
The individual exercises were the most useful.  It encourages the attendees to work together and think through a problem.
How well was the day structured?  For example, did the course cover too much or too little information, would you have preferred more or less group work, etc.
More group work.  Although you are limited w/one day groups
On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best), how would you rate this course for usefulness and relevance to your work?
8.5
Other Comments:
      Good course...I was a bit worried in the first hour as we focused on compilation errors for data gathering
If you have any questions, please let me know!

Regards,
Grace
