I will track down more details this week.  
 
Janet,
 
I read about our west coast C&I/retail power positions today in Chronicle.  Are we keeping these or selling them?  As I mentioned last week, if we keep them, we need to talk about the infrastruture that will be needed to serve these and our other west coast wholesale positions.
 
I will be around all this week

Jimmie, agree; however, EES cannot immediately convey these agreements to EBSI as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy. Under bankruptcy, we need to show an auction process.  In the cases, where EBSI has contracted directly with the client - I think we are ok.

Vicki please add some texture if required.

Mike and I discussed, and I need to be involved only to the extent that there is a current subcontract agreement in place between EES and EBSI for the provision of these O&M services.  Since EBSI is owned by ServiceCo, we need to be careful in the handling of this subcontract as well as the employees.

Mike, I would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services (DSM/O&M) currently provided by EES to Hensen LLC.  Other than a heads up to Jimmie given the potential effects to EBSI, I am assuming that you and Jeremy et al are managing the sale.  Given the amount of work in front of Jimmie around EFS generally (sale of ConstructionCo and restructuring of ServiceCo, I would hope not to overload Jimmie on another sale process.

Thoughts?

Yesterday, it was decided that we attempt to sell the O&M portion of the EES contract with Eli Lilly.  This would include approx 250 employees that EBSI, through the contract, walked over to its payroll from Lilly.  

This contract is material to EBSI.  Also it is likely that Lilly will oppose a sale of the agreement, accept to a friendly vendor relationship, Kite Development (which has previously expressed interest similar to Honeywell's below).   Please email me with a time we can chat.

I am handling the sale of the Construction Services Group and we are evaluating ServiceCo alternatives.  From your message it appears they would not be interested in the construction side, but if they are we should speak with them soon.  Otherwise, it would be good to get a contact re: ServiceCo because there may be some things we are interested in selling from within ServiceCo.

Give me a call and we can decide how best to handle them at this time.

We have presented the following customer counts to buyers, which are compared below against Beth and Shelly's numbers:

		Count presented		Total Available (from Beth)		Shortfall
Texas			14,696			17,100				14%
New York		7,658			8,500				10%
Massach.		4,944			5,700				13%

The count presented to buyers came by utilizing the data in the sequel server database (maintained by Chris McCaig and Mary John) and the information in the RPS system (the booking batch files).  We are working with deal capture to determine the sources of discrepancies.

After receiving bids today, we will 1. determine to what extent we want to book and process remaininig deals, 2. develop a plan for developing the definitive mass market customer list.

Subject:	Mass Market Contract processing status update



Just a quick update from Shelly and I on where we stand with processing all of the Mass Market contracts.  We will need more resources to process the remaining 6,000 contracts.  We estimate that it would take 12 people 1 week.  

  Texas  ---
 
We are aware of  approximately 18,000 contracts signed to date  -- of those approximately 900 were rejected for Credit and Data Issues - net contracts 17,100
               

                          6,000   completely processed and on hold at CSC
                          7,700   processed but not submitted to CSC
                          3,400   NEED TO BE Booked and processed  
                         ---------
                         17,100  Total available TX contracts

In order to process them  -- they need to be booked to the risk books (Deb  -- assume you can have someone work on this)  and then Shelly's team can validate and pull the extra data that is needed  -- ESID's and 4 digit zip code extensions.  They will also validate credit approval etc like usual.  May need additional people to find missing data like Mary John's team used to do.

The goal would be to have all of the data ready to tranfer to a buyer  -- so that they can quickly enroll these customers, and have a very clean list of contracts with corresponding values.

New York

We are aware of 9,200 contracts signed to date  -- of these 700 were rejected for a net remaining contrac number of 8,500.

                        5,600 completely processed and sent to CSC   (  x are already live and  y are on hold for enrollment) -- we are getting this breakdown now
                        1,400  processed but not submitted
                        1,500 NEED TO BE Booked and processed
                        -------
                         8,500   total available NY contracts

Similar processing   -- these deals need to be accounted for  -- by booking them



Mass.

We are aware of 6,500 contracts signed to date  -- of those 800 were rejected leaving 5,700 contracts to be processed

                          4,500 completely processed and sent to CSC (x are already live and y are on hold for enrollment )  (we are getting this breakdown now)
                             200 more processed but not submitted
                          1,000  NEED TO BE Booked and processed
                          ---------
                          5,700   total available Mass.  contracts
Similar processing   -- these deals need to be accounted for  -- by booking them

We will need to either hire contractors or borrow staff from other business units to complete this processing.  We estimate that with 6 extra staff this effort would take 2 weeks.  We could cut that time in half with double the staff.  This does not include an estimate of time to book each transaction into RPS thru the batch process.

Guys, it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact I had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages, I don't think there any funds to spend.  Perhaps there are empty offices in 3 Allen.  Please look into.  Either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated.  I am waiting for a confidentiality from Calpine and AEP this AM.

Who are the authorized parties we are establishing for the new ServiceCo Holdings bank account.  I propose that the account have duel authorization from two of the following: Jimmie Williams and Dan Leff or Janet Dietrich.  Based on conversations with David Roland, we probably do not want to have the ServiceCo directors from Enron authorizing these items unless the ServiceCo BOD acts as a whole.  We need to make sure we continue to have separate controls for the ServiceCo accounts because of the fiduciary duties to the outside investors in ServiceCo.

Mary,

To be clear on what my understanding is of what Ray approved in his conversation with Dave Delainey:

1. A Frost Bank account will be opened for ServiceCo. Holdings Inc. first thing Thursday morning and all of ServiceCo. funds wherever they may be will be moved into this account.  It's my understanding that there is approximately $70MM in funds in various bank accounts, primarily Citibank;

2.  First thing Thursday morning we will stop sweeping any Enron Facility Services (EFS) bank account;

3.  Given that EFS' existing receipt accounts that you will stop sweeping are with Bank of America, I assume we want to set up a Frost account for EFS that they can redirect thier customers to remit to.

You can reach me in my office at 5-7464 or on my cell phone at 713-419-2498 if you have any questions, need any clarity or if any of the above will not be effective first thing in the morning.

Thanks

Deborah, I have received your letter dated December 18, 2001 and I will ensure that you get a follow up.

To give you a little texture on the issues, all pre-petition expense statements (Dec 2, 2001) were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid. At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement. This part of the bankruptcy process.  It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.

Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.

Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.  If not please give me a call at 713-853-3829.

Ray, as per your request see attached::

The bottom line we will need approximately $82M for the month of December in order to maintain an asset worth approximately $375M.  The vast majority 80%+ is prepaid energy which will be recovered from the customer.  It is highly likely that we will be able to sell this book.

Ray, in EES, the Construction Services (also known as EFS) companies operat=
e on a stand alone basis from Enron and have clear liquidation value to the=
 parents - EES and Enron Corp.  It is my opinion that we should be trying t=
o "un-buckle" these companies from Enron over the short term to ensure thei=
r continued viablility as we find a sale.  In my view un-buckling means a) =
stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up mov=
ing cash out of Construction Services up into the parents; b) utilizing tho=
se receivables plus, if necessary, Enron's interest in Construction Service=
s to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the St. Paul surety bond.  This =
surety bond is necessary to continue contracting; and c) terminate the swee=
ping of cash from Construction Services bank accounts to Corp immediately. =
 There will be a meeting early next week with St Paul to renew the surety b=
ond.  I am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstat=
e the surety bond.  The Construction Services group employs approximately 2=
,600 people and is worth (given current backlog) between $100 and $125 mill=
ion dollars.  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 6=
0 to 90 days and we control 100% of the stock of this company.

The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group (also =
know as ServiceCo). Again, these companies largely operate independently of=
 Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron.  Currently, we have o=
utside technology and financial partners in the Facility Services Groups th=
at make it impossible to factor receivables or move cash out of Facility Se=
rvices bank accounts without the approval of the board which includes sever=
al outside directors.  We currently own approximately 85% of the firm that =
employs approximately 1,400 people and is worth minimum $50 million dollars=
 (cash value).  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise =
dispose over the next 60 to 90 days.

EES also manages several joint ventures (DSM and O&M related mostly) with c=
ustomers where we would have to have outside approvals to move cash out of =
these entities. These include Owens Corning Energy LLC (Owens Corning), LE =
Hesten Energy LLC (Lily), Tenant Services Inc. (Simon Properties), EBC Prop=
erty LLC and Enron Distributed Energy Services LLC.  In all cases, we need =
to be observant of corporate governance issues with these entities.

As officers, I thought it prudent to ensure that you and your team had all =
available information.  I would also like your approval to move forward wit=
h my recommendations for the Construction Services group as above.

We appreciate everything you are doing.

Jimmie, I assume that you and Tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week.  It would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance.

David, we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next Wednesday or Thursday.

Vicki, we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed.

Deborah, I have received your letter dated December 18, 2001 and I will ensure that you get a follow up.

To give you a little texture on the issues, all pre-petition expense statements (Dec 2, 2001) were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid. At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement. This part of the bankruptcy process.  It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.

Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.

Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.  If not please give me a call at 713-853-3829.

Regards
Delainey

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

Thanks

I asked Scott to figure out the exposure of EESC to its contracts because I am trying to figure a way to structure the sale of EDCC to maximize the value to Corp.  If these numbers are right ECC is going to take a big bath on its 7.5 M note to EESC.  In addition, we need to put EESC down because its just bleeding cash and is a burden to ECC.  I think we should do it tomorrow and give Owings the heads up.

Gentlemen,
I know this information is very relevant, so want to get it to you even though I am uncomfortable with some of my assumptions.  I have done the best I can to calculate OCC's position in Eastern Canada.  Phone calls to Houston have mostly gone unanswered, and the contract wording is unclear.  Based on my new found knowledge of power utility tariffs, I have some bad news.  A snapshot of my estimated NPV:

($2,000,000)  Owens Corning Gas Position - estimated by Brian Gillis last month (sale at Ontario burner tip at AECO Index + Cdn$1.73/GJ until Sept 30, 2009 while Nova, TCPL and LDC demand, commod & fuel climbs to over $2.40 by 2005.
($4,500,000)  Owens Corning Alberta Position (Sale of approx. 9 MWh until April 2005 at Cdn$28/MWh in a $40 market)
(2,500,000)  Owens Corning Ontario Position (Sale of approx. 18MWh until January 1, 2003 at Cdn$41.33/MWh in a $48 market)
($9,000,000)  Liquidated damages potential

This compares with EES Houston's estimate of a net gain of over US$14 million.  I feel comfortable with the information, but continue to phone Houston to have someone review my assumptions with them.  Also, I was provided a position summary from EES's risk group, and was provided a Quaker Oats power position.  I flipped out when I saw it, and am now chasing it down as well.  Their risk group claim it is in the money by $2.5 million, which probably means under water by a similar amount.

Dave and Janet - Greetings. 
 
In one of the recent FAQs/responses, I was reminded that the vesting requirement for the Cash Balance Plan is 5 years.  I was hired on 1feb97 and was laid off on 3dec01, just less than 2 months from being fully vested.  I am certain that there are others in the same position.  
 
Further, I understand that the Cash Balance Plan is/was fully funded - i.e., the money was there in the account for all the employees on an on-going basis.  
 
But for recent events, I, and many other Enron employees, would have achieved the full vesting for the cash balance plan.
 
So, we are faced with some options:
a) do nothing and maintain the status quo.  Result - loss of Cash Balance Plan.
b) round up from 4.5 years for any Enron employee.  Result - ability to realize the value of the Cash Balance Plan.
c) For administrative purposes only (i.e., no job, no salary, no other benefits), "re-hire" those laid off employees that have 4.5 years or more employment time until they achieve the 5 years vesting requirement for the Cash Balance Plan.  Comment - this option has the potential to be fairly thorny.
 
At any rate, I respectfully request that this issue be looked into.  I, and many other employees were hard-working and loyal.  I'd like to think that the Cash Balance Plan, something that many of us would have achieved but for recent events, will not be lost to us.  
 
Tiiming is everything.
 
Again, and as I did on the last day, I wish you both well.  Best of luck.  Regards.  Scott.

Dave,
Thanks for stopping by today.  I've enjoyed working with you.  You're an outstanding leader, and I don't say that lightly.  It's disappointing that we won't finish what we've started.  However, I'm confident this will work out for the best.
 
Below is my contact information.  If you can provide me with your contact information, I'd like to take you up on your offer to be a reference...I'll use it judiciously.
 
If you need someone down the road that is dedicated, capable and will get the job done, please keep me in mind.
 
Have a great holiday.
 
Regards,
Mike Harris

Section 3.4.2 B allows EES to present a third party offer to REXAM, in lieu of our own supply, in order to preserve our performance under the contract while maintaining the price charged to the Customer (Rexam).  By allowing the Customer to acquire their own gas supply EES may be defaulting on its performance to supply gas.  Please let me know if we need to take any action in this case.

I received a call today from Jack Bender with Rexam aka American Can(GNO customer) that they are going to secure supply from another supplier for the Peoples and ONG LDC's. We lost all our supply on ONG 12/1 and are now out of storage on Peoples. They were notified by Peoples today that we were not serving them.They indicated they will forward me a copy of their contract with the new supplier as a FYI.

Jeff-Please confirm that our storage is now gone for December for Rexam's pool.

I would like to  get with you, Janet, Melanie and whomever else is appropriate to discuss our overall strategy relating to the  rejection or assumption of our contracts.  She has expressed concern that we need to make these decisions quickly, to cut off claims by our customers for post petition nonperformance.  We should go over our overall strategy with her  about our various contract buckets, especially how much longer we can continue serving customers where we are putting them in a penalty situation.  
Melanie will be out of town Monday and Tuesday, so I am going to set this up for tomorrow.  Please let me know who else should attend. Thanks.

Subject: Ability to Perform

Based on confirmation by Tony Valenzuela that the Enron - Dynergy merger will
not occur as suggested in your memo of November 20, 2001, I am concerned about
your company's ability to perform under our Commodity Management Agreement
(CMA) dated January 6, 2001.

Accordingly, please:

1. prove to me that the utility accounts for which your company provides bill
payment services are current and utility invoices for the October month
business have been paid and there are no amounts in arrears,

2. prove to me that natural gas deliveries were properly made for November,
2001  into the citygates of the local distribution companies which service the
natural gas accounts listed in the CMA,

3. Prove to me that natural gas deliveries will be properly made for December,
2001  into the citygates of the local distribution companies which service the
natural gas accounts listed in the CMA.

Please provide this information by the end of this week so that we are
comfortable that our agreement is in proper working order for the month of
December, 2001.

Thank you.

Mike, I would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services (DSM/O&M) currently provided by EES to Hensen LLC.  Other than a heads up to Jimmie given the potential effects to EBSI, I am assuming that you and Jeremy et al are managing the sale.  Given the amount of work in front of Jimmie around EFS generally (sale of ConstructionCo and restructuring of ServiceCo, I would hope not to overload Jimmie on another sale process.

Thoughts?

Yesterday, it was decided that we attempt to sell the O&M portion of the EES contract with Eli Lilly.  This would include approx 250 employees that EBSI, through the contract, walked over to its payroll from Lilly.  

This contract is material to EBSI.  Also it is likely that Lilly will oppose a sale of the agreement, accept to a friendly vendor relationship, Kite Development (which has previously expressed interest similar to Honeywell's below).   Please email me with a time we can chat.

Mike,

I am handling the sale of the Construction Services Group and we are evaluating ServiceCo alternatives.  From your message it appears they would not be interested in the construction side, but if they are we should speak with them soon.  Otherwise, it would be good to get a contact re: ServiceCo because there may be some things we are interested in selling from within ServiceCo.

Give me a call and we can decide how best to handle them at this time.

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

Thanks

This is the best I can get today - it includes all that are not EES - but I'm guessing that you have a fairly good feel for them.

Another health warning - this shows individuals who are still on the payroll - some of who I know have left the company ( eg. Jeff Shankman and Mike McConnell) 

I should be able to get you the EES information on Monday

Let me know if you need anything else.

Kimberly, I was laid off on Monday and have not had my latest expense report electronically deposited into the credit union.  I was assured by management that I would be paid.  The amount is 642.10.  I would think that this is the least enron could do for me since I have only worked for EES for 2 months.  
 
Please ensure that my funds are deposited as soon as possible due to my current financial crisis.
 
Thank You,

Dick, thanks for the e-mail.  I don't think I disagree with any of the points you made and I do think we have come a long way over the last year in the DSM "technology" we employ.  Unfortunately, a lot of these changes in thinking, sales and cost structure are too little too late.  It is highly unlikely at this point that EES will exist beyond next week.  All the best in the future and I would like to personally thank you for your contribution, thought process and caring to the end to make your point.

Regards
Delainey

Subject:	DSM developers create value

Dave, Janet, and Dan,

Before I think about where I could best apply my talents somewhere else I want to make sure you know why I (and all the other DSM developers) can bring value to you at EES.

If DSM is part of the future offering of EES I think it is absolutely essential that you have your own developers in house, both in the home office and the field offices.  They are the originators of DSM value.  There are no projects for the rest of the DSM team to evaluate and plan for until a developer puts it on the list in the first place.  I routinely make the decision on my own whether to include or discard projects that have NPVs over $1million each.  I think this should be seen as a key decision in our business process!

I think there has not been enough recognition at EES that DSM development is a creative activity.  Those lists of projects we price and implement can't be created by having a rookie go down a checklist.  The DSM engineers ask a lot of probing questions to find projects that will both save energy and be acceptable to the customer.  And the largest, most valuable projects take the most experience and creativity to discover.

There has been talk about outsourcing the development services in the past.  That can be done to a point but you need to have your own developers to teach the outsiders and evaluate their work.  I have worked on EES development efforts with outside consultants and they always need some time to catch on to our value proposition and our ways of processing information.

As you are thinking about the future of EES I want to make a sales pitch for keeping the team of DSM developers you have.  This has been my niche in life here at EES the past 3 years, and was the entire focus of my professional life for the 8 years before that.  I am a licensed Professional Engineer and a Certified Energy Manager.  I know what I am talking about--you have a very talented, experienced team that should be seen as a source of value and not just necessary overhead.

Most of your developers came from smaller organizations where we performed more functions--everything from cold sales calls, to report writing, to bookkeeping, to ordering office supplies and shoveling snow.  We can do it again!

Dick Rusk

David,
Per my phone message, I have been informed through my friend at British Petroleum (Andrew Netemeyer, VP Electric Trading) that there has been an inquiry to Mr Frevert via voice mail by Mr. Tony Fountain (President, BP Energy) about wholesale issues and retail interests of Enron.  They appear to have some issues on the wholesale side to discuss but have significant interest in the retail books of business with EES and wish to discuss these with you asap..Andrew Netemeyer would bring a Mr. Bill Burton in their M&A department into the loop and I beleive they have already had some individuals assigned to due some due diligence if Enron will entertain the interest.  Mr Netemeyer's number is (281) 366-4998, and any assistance I can provide regarding introductions or relationship let me know, they have been considering the expansion of retail gas & power and the timing may be right... 
Regards, 
MVA
