Chip:

As we discussed a couple of days ago, we have prepared a payment direction letter regarding our final payment from AES on the Haywood deal. The letter directs AES to make payment directly to our consultant ($100k) with the balance to us by check ($2,010k).

Please let Kay, Staurt and I know if you're OK with this (via return e-mail), and we will send it to AES. Stuart, Kay and I have each reviewed the letter.

I expect that we should be in a position to receive these funds hopefully late next week.

Thanks,

Ben

   Kay,
       Steve has asked that I inquire if you are available tomorrow at 12 :
30 pm (central) for a conference call to discuss the proposed consolidation.
I do not think that the call will require much time.

I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation.
Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do
so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not
consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would
need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't
think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of
December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue
the hearing until January anyway.

Kay

Subject: Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach/Air Permitting Update 


    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP
is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings
into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the
cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the
sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted
our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing
our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The
cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in
December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are
not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in
the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not
hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate
that
Enron objects to the consolidation.    
         Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enron's response
to
DEP's Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit.   I promised
not
to file any response last week, given the pending settlement
negotiations
but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days. 
         Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation.  
            --Kerri    .

Subject:	RE: Cogentrix

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kortney

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. 

Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?

Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris. My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy.

Thanks,

Kay

Travis,

The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak.  Eric is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.  Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through Eric.

We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).  We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.  Cheryl was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.

I'm still here.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

We need to get to closure on how to respond to motion to consolidate, and how to deal with the 36 vs 42 issue on Deerfield. Shall we try again for a conference call later today? Karri is available up until 4:30pm, (Central).

I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D. had the authority to sign the consent.  I would think that this shouldn't take very long.

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject:	Additional Information Needed

Kay,

In going through the contracts assigned to us, I have determined that we do not have all contracts necessary to evaluate our exposure/potential work out of the various transaction.  To summarize:

1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.:  The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired.  Is there an amendment or extension?

2.Ameren Services Company:  The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI.  There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well.  Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer.  This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party.

3.Connecticut Light & Power:  Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).  Jim Grace and Sheila Tweed are the responsible parties for the CRRA workout.  As this contract is inextricably linked, shouldn't they take over this contract as well?

4.GPU:  I believe there are additional contracts out there  governing transactions between EPMI and the various GPU subsidiaries.  Will you have a search run on the follow company names?

GPU Services
GPU Energy
Jersey Central Power & Light Company
Metropolitan Edison Company
Pennsylvania Electric Company

Thanks!

Heather

I have reviewed the proposed change with our management, and we may be able

The changes were made to the version you sent back to Siemens Westinghouse

and we will begin the execution process on our end.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Ann,

Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language
for your consideration:

WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and
alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage
because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with
adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive
vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such
damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to
Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount
of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars
($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks ("Warranty
Issue").

I hope this gets us there.  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement
Agreement
and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial
discussions
between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions
with
Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of
the
Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise
concerns
to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for
reconstruction
of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in
exchange
for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 

The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references
to
the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that
issue
from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes
the
value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As
modified,
the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest
not
to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be
willing
to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
would be willing to sign on to the deal.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC
would
like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no
responsibility
unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

I coded the King and Spalding invoices in IPAYIT yesterday. Before coding, I had to forward the invoices to Ben for his approval. So, they should be processed and paid soon through IPAYIT. 

Thanks-

They are supposed to give no less than 5 business days notice prior to closing.  The earliest notice I saw was Nov. 19.  I counted the 20th, 21st, 23, 26, closing on the 27th. (page 12 of the amended and restated LLC agreement).

Here's what I got from Eric on the lease.  The numbers don't seem to match, but we won't worry about that now.

The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday. 

Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.  To the extent necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial questions.  We won't tackle the security agreement or the license agreement yet. Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).

Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.  If the docs aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any additional expense.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until things become a bit more clear.  

Thanks,

Kay

Hi there.

We need to get to closure on how to respond to motion to consolidate, and how to deal with the 36 vs 42 issue on Deerfield. Shall we try again for a conference call later today? Karri is available up until 4:30pm, (Central).

I was reading something on how we will be the biggest bankruptcy ever and have a great degree of comfort about our reorg.  Apparently, our debt is only in the neighborhood of $16 billion and as of September, our books had our assets valued at nearly $61 billion !

Kay at this time MDEA has $292,544.40 that they owe us.  We have approximately $360,000  that we have made in profit according to our P&L from Risk.  At this time we are not doing any buying or selling for MDEA.  We run the load forecast, determine the position and then we get a market price from WRI.  We then call MDEA and inform them of the Market and their position.  They then tell us to buy the power from WRI.  We call WRI and they bill MDEA, not us.  We then do the tag.

I gave the IP Transit deal a quick look, and it appears to me that what we need to do is prepare an amended confirm, with the capacity and price varying, depending on the month.  May want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement.  Please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change.

I suggest that we make a capacity/price schedule and attach it, amending the confirm to refer to the new schedule.

What do you think?

Hi Jerry,
 
Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
 
Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter fromN orthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to bew ired.  My fax number is 713 646 3491.
 
I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.  Quite frankly I just overlooked it.

Neil has been asking around.  Can't get anyone at Enron to think that far ahead.  I hate doing this, but I owe it to Michael, since I really want to keep him in private school. We've already eliminated his speech therapy.  Geez, I sound pathetic.

New program.  The only termination notices we are responding to are those with termination payment calculations.

Some of the letters were something other than termination/suspension notices, so you might want to check to see if you think we need to reply for other reasons.

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

For what it is worth, this is from Blue Ridge Power Agency website:  http://www.brpa.org/



About BRPA:
Blue Ridge Power Agency ("Blue Ridge") is a non-profit corporation established in 1988 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and falls under Section 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a "joint action" agency that operates as directed by the Board of Directors. Each member appoints one Director and one Alternate from its organization to the Board.
The ultimate goal of the organization, through the power of numbers and economies of scale of cooperative, "joint" action, is to pursue those activities which will insure the most reliable and lowest cost wholesale electric power supplies possible for its members today and in the future.
There are currently nine members of the agency as listed below, consisting of seven municipalities, one state institution and one electric cooperative. Blue Ridge represents its members' best interest in several forums by direct staff involvement and/or coordination of the efforts of its attorney(s) and consultant(s). In each of these areas, wholesale and/or retail power supply and service issues are involved: energy and transmission contract negotiation; contract administration; consolidated billing; state and federal regulatory proceedings and litigation; state and federal legislation which includes education and lobbying efforts; joint purchasing; industry information dissemination; training; and "as assigned."
The current efforts of Blue Ridge and its staff are focused mostly in two areas: (1) administering its current power supply contract with Cinergy and the associated transmission contract with American Electric Power; (2) representing BRPA members' interest where wholesale power supply and transmission issues are involved, particularly in regard to the electric industry's transition to a restructured, "customer choice" structure. Generation was deregulated at the Federal level in 1992. Efforts now concentrate on the restructuring of the regulatory provisions for continued monopoly service at the transmission, distribution and customer service levels of the industry. It is especially crucial that the laws and regulatory structures that develop over the next few years are fair, non-discriminatory and promote real competition.

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Thanks,

Kay

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:

1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.

2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.

I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.

Subject: Order of Consolidation 


      I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving ! 
      FYI-- Judge Stampelos issued an Order consolidating the pending
Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach air permit challenges into a single
proceeding, which is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, January 29th, 2002,
through February 1st, 2002.   Under the Order, the pre-hearing stipulation
is required to be filed by January 24th.   I will be sending a copy of the
Order by facsimile.   
       Please keep me apprised of the status of the settlement negotiations
as they progress.   I will send you a copy of the proposed permit language
for the Pompano Beach proceeding upon receipt from Martha Nebelsiek of DEP.

       If you have any questions or comments on the foregoing, please
contact me.  
         --Kerri

We are considering submitting a bid to provide standard offer service to commercial and industrial end users.  Can you tell me if EPMI is licensed to provide retail service in Maine?  If you aren't the right person, who should I ask?

Thanks bunches,

Mike Young from NW called to advise me that they received GE's consent. NW plans to send us notice of this tomorrow. I believe this will trigger our obligation to pay NW the balance of payments we hold, discounted at 7.5 % p.a. I believe this means that we will need to pay NW $5.1 million of the $5.2 million we have been prepaid.

Let's talk about this in the AM.

I will have to find a form.  If you think the deal will extend more than a couple of months, or could develop into something bigger, I really suggest an EEI.

Once I find a form we can determine if we need a separate services agreement, or we can bake it into the GTC's/long confirm document.

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

Ben,

As Fred pointed out, he thinks the "gas" agreement you are referring to is the Amended and Restated Gas Sales Agreement, which is Exhibit "A" to the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.

John and/or Bart:  I have a copy of the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.  Who wants it?

Kayne and Rahil,

Please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary.  For instance, it gives the delivery point as the CPL/Cogentrix border, and not the bb of the facility as Kayne suggested.  I am drafting off of the term sheet, so your input is very important.

I need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them.  Also, are we still planning on dealing with some PPA's they have?  If so, what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved?

Are we only going to pay Cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party?  If they fail to remit other costs (transmission, for instance), I presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them.  What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for?  What are Resource Costs?

How often will we email or fax them a sales summary? Will we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold?

Kortney, please confirm that Credit will not be requiring any particular language, etc in this deal since we aren't using an EEI.

Thanks for your help,

Kay

I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation. Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until January anyway.

Kay

Subject: Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach/Air Permitting Update 


    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate that
Enron objects to the consolidation.    
         Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enron's response to
DEP's Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit.   I promised not
to file any response last week, given the pending settlement negotiations
but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days. 
         Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation.  
            --Kerri    .

The revised JVD opinion has him opining as to non-contravention issues with respect to The Portland General Pledge Agreement.  He shouldn't be giving this opinion.  His opinion was originally limited to due authorization only.  This is problematic.

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

I see they've halted the sending of replies.  I will see if you should prepare them anyway to send tomorrow.

Here's the list of what we have so far.  I'll give you the letters and Debra is in charge of the files. It may be we don't have to look at every contract to get this done.

Hi there,

I've been told that the waiver needs to contain a statement that GT won't bring suit against any of the officers, directors or employees of Enron.  If you can make that change and fax me a new waiver, we will get it done as quickly as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

It appeared to me that a GSA would be most appropriate for this work.  In speaking with some other EBS lawyers, I was told that Adriana could craft the work order/addendum to go with the GSA.  Please let me know if this is incorrect.

In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:

1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.

2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.

I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.

Kay & Rahil:  Just to make my position clear, if legal determines that an EEI is still necessary with this counterparty then we should go forward with pursuing an EEI agreement.

The credit position is that if the deal needs to get done soon, then let's just use the GTCs and we can follow up later with an EEI (if deemed necessary by legal).  If we can wait a couple of weeks, then let's go forward with negotiating an EEI now.

Hopefully this clarifies our position.  Sorry for the confusion.  If the later is the case, then Rahil, I will need to get financial statements from the counterparty and review.

Thank you.

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

Hi Jerry,
 
Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
 
Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter from NorthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired.  My fax number is 713 646 3491.
 
I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.  Quite frankly I just overlooked it.
 
Kay

Subject:	RE: USTeleNet Transaction

If we purchased the switch from an outside party and then leased it to USTeleNet under a capital lease, the asset would still be booked on UST's books at its FMV.  There would be no associated gain as the asset was never theirs (the third party would get the gain on sale).  Bullets 3 and 4 would be basically the same, except for the cash going to a third party.

What if we purchase the switch from a 3rd party, i.e. CES?  How would that affect your 1st 2 bullets?

Subject:	USTeleNet Transaction

Just to follow-up on our discussion yesterday regarding the accounting treatment assuming that USTeleNet owns the switch and that we purchase the switch and lease it back to them under a "capital" lease, the following would occur:

The asset would stay on their books (however it would be "marked-up" to FMV as evidenced by the purchase price)
They would defer the gain, if any, over the asset's life.
They would record a payable on their balance sheet and recognize interest expense in their P&L as payments are made
We would record the payment of cash to them and book a receivable and deferred interest income (to be recognized over the lease term)

Essentially we are lending them money equal to the FMV of their asset and receiving interest payments in return (i.e. direct financing lease)

I would be happy to go into more detail at your request.  Please let me know as issues develop and I will assist as necessary.

Thought I would ask a more specific question.  Do you know of any transactions which Enron may be in default due to recent circumstances?  I'm excluding trading deals.  Maybe some of the asset management deals?  Joint venture companies (enovate?)?

Thanks,

November 14, 2001



TO:     INTERESTED POWER SUPPLIERS AND MARKETERS

RE:     REQUEST FOR RETAIL PROPOSALS - MAINE STANDARD OFFER SERVICE



        The Maine Public Utilities Commission is soliciting proposals from
interested power suppliers and marketers to supply retail standard offer
service to commercial and industrial customers of Maine's two largest
electric utilities, Central Maine Power Company and Bangor Hydro-Electric
Company.  The total annual electricity sales to these customers is about 6.8
million MWh, of which 30% currently receives standard offer service. 

        The standard offer suppliers will provide service beginning March 1,
2002.  At your option, bids may be submitted for one, two or three year
terms.  Service will be provided directly by suppliers to customers at
retail, although the utility will handle billing and collection on the
standard offer supplier's behalf. 

        Concurrent with the Commission's solicitation for retail standard
offer service, Central Maine Power Company and Bangor Hydro-Electric Company
will be seeking proposals for wholesale standard offer supply.  The
concurrent solicitations will allow the Commission to evaluate all options
simultaneously and sufficiently in advance of March 1. You may participate
in both the retail and wholesale processes.  Initial bids for all of these
solicitations will be due on December 4, 2001.

The RFPs for the retail solicitation are available at www.state.me.us/mpuc.
Please note that there are separate RFPs for each utility.  The RFPs contain
detailed information about Maine's standard offer and instructions on how to
participate.  To obtain the RFPs by mail or email, please contact Tammy
French (at 207-287-6075 or tammy.french@state.me.us
< <mailto:tammy.french@state.me.us>> )   For additional information,  please
contact Faith Huntington (at faith.huntington@state.me.us

Here it is.  As mentioned, I have not seen an executed copy, and there may not be one.

TPC is a Delaware corp. HQ'd in Danbury, CT.  Would that mean the Ch. 11 was filed in Delaware?

Subject: RE: Genuity Buy and Corp Sell (Back to Back)


Kay,
 
We need to incorporate the following components into the Genuity Solutions Inc. Master Agreement:

We need a parent guarantee from Genuity Inc. ($10MM) and are willing to reciprocate (Enron Corp. $10MM).  We need to insert Events of Default with respect to guarantor. (Credit Support Annex section 4 and 5 from our MSA) 
We need to insert netting (MSA section 6.4) and close-out setoff (MSA section 5.7). 
We need to insert the ability to request financial statements from the Guarantor if they are not publicly available (MSA section 8). 
The assignment language needs to be re-amended.  Both parties can only assign to an affiliate that is at least as creditworthy as the existing - i.e. we need to maintain the parent guarantee. (MSA section 10.4). The current amendment is unclear whether or not Genuity is the only party allowed to assign to an affiliate. 
We need a bilateral bankruptcy event of default. (MSA section 5.1(iv)). 
There is no clause regarding disputes of invoices.  We can use our standard language from the MSA.(Section 6.3). 
Do we need to state that we are a forward contract merchant?

Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

Arshak - We will approve this transaction with Genuity Solutions Inc. 

Please note - before any additional transactions with Genuity Solutions or Genuity Telecom occur we must amend the Master Agreement.  CRM does not approve of the form for the Master Agreement with Genuity Solutions, Inc.  There are no events of default with respect to EBS, we need to incorporate set-off language between the two affiliates and we need to push for a parent guarantee.

Molly - please attach these comments to the confirmation for the file. 

Lance - Can we get somebody in legal assigned to help amend this agreement?

Have you booked the $102,010 discount associated with the Northwestern deal as income?

On the Delta Power LM 6000 deal, I believe the legal invoices should be split according to the income allocation. I think the split was $4 million to Calger, and $2 million to me.

They've changed the Cogentrix deal.  In fact, it is even a different Cogentrix counterparty.  I couldn't find the long form/GTC in the Power Forms.  Can you help?

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

I'm still sorting through all of the WSJ articles, but if you read this one, I think it's clear that Lay, Skilling, Fastow, Arthur Andersen and others will have criminal prosecutions and disgourgements.  It is very rare that the WSJ with its conservative bent and with a Republican President writes this type of Op-Ed.  Nevertheless, the article already sets the predicate of Lay's defense that he did not fully comprehend what was going on and, thus, lacked the mens rea for the crimes that Skilling and Fastow will be charged with.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Investigating Enron

11/30/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You can cut the Schadenfreude with a machete these days as Enron careens toward failure. Like any fast-rising, innovative business, the energy trader made enemies, some with a fair grievance and some not. We hope the inevitable (and necessary) investigations keep in mind the difference. 
Enron was a forthright advocate of competition, as every obituary of the past few days has noted. Some see the firm's collapse as discrediting the market economics it championed, though the opposite is closer to the truth.
It strikes us that Enron was partly a victim of its own success. Its revenues quadrupled in a year, thanks to the fillip that California's troubles provided to the wholesale power market. But profits were up much less -- i.e., Enron was earning thinner margins in the energy-trading business it pioneered. The new industry quickly became too competitive and transparent to afford any windfalls, just as deregulation admirers would have predicted. 
Enron does not own U.S. power plants and generally did not seem to make outsized profits on power for resale in, say, California. But that didn't stop California's eccentric attorney general, Bill Lockyer, from blaming Enron CEO Ken Lay for that state's electricity mismanagement. Last summer he told a Wall Street Journal reporter that, "I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi my name is Spike, honey.'" Consider that an unfair grievance. 
Accounting matters are more troubling. The struggle for a century has been to make sure corporate managers don't pursue their own agendas at the expense of owners. The emergence of special partnerships, controlled and owned by Enron's own senior officers, with which the company did some of its murkiest deals, would cause even libertarians to wonder what's been going on. Clearly Mr. Lay didn't fully understand what former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was up to, and shareholders weren't told either. 
At the same time, Enron officers had a large amount of personal wealth tied up in Enron stock, which has fallen from $90 to 61 cents. So the mere existence of these partnership deals does not automatically indicate corrupt intent. Only a detailed investigation can resolve whether these deals were honestly motivated, and whether Enron's (and Arthur Andersen's) interpretation of accounting rules was defensible. In any case, trial lawyers will descend to squeeze every penny out of Enron's troubles for themselves (and for shareholders or employees who held Enron stock in their 401(k)s). 
As for the investigations, we hope they won't be influenced one way or another by long connections between Mr. Lay and President Bush. Even the hint of special treatment would be a political disaster, especially for an Administration that promised to clean up after Bill Clinton. 
While tradition has been not to make criminal matters out of accounting scandals, exceptions have arisen recently. Federal prosecutors in New York have gone after Walter Forbes, who sold his company to Cendant, giving rise to what before Enron was the nation's most costly stock meltdown due to bad accounting. San Francisco prosecutors recently extracted guilty pleas from executives of Aurora Foods over their treatment of trade promotion expenses for their portfolio of "orphan" brands as capital expenditures. 
Enron is an opportunity for the Bush team to show it can police similar financial chicanery, if some is found. Sorting the capitalists from the crooks is one way of protecting capitalism.

Janet, 

Do you know if we have any deals in Texas or Penn which might be impacted by a license suspension?  I know that's a tough question.

Yes, but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate. By the way, it was certificate #2, so I changed the language in the power to reflect that.

Hi there.

We need to get to closure on how to respond to motion to consolidate, and how to deal with the 36 vs 42 issue on Deerfield. Shall we try again for a conference call later today? Karri is available up until 4:30pm, (Central).

Thanks,

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I have reviewed the proposed change with our management, and we may be able

document, in which I have incorporated your changes as proposed on 10/9/01.
The changes were made to the version you sent back to Siemens Westinghouse
on 10/01/01.  If we both agree that this version is accurate, please advise
and we will begin the execution process on our end.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Ann,

Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language
for your consideration:

WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and
alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage
because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with
adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive
vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such
damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to
Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount
of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars
($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks ("Warranty
Issue").

I hope this gets us there.  

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: RE: Settlement agreement



Kay:

We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement
Agreement
and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial
discussions
between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions
with
Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of
the
Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise
concerns
to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for
reconstruction
of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in
exchange
for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 

The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references
to
the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that
issue
from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes
the
value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As
modified,
the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest
not
to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be
willing
to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
would be willing to sign on to the deal.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC
would
like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no
responsibility
unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

Haven't done anything with it since there hasn't been any activity.  If we think that we want to do something, it would be helpful to get a copy of the master.  I don't think I still have a copy.  I can probably look it up on Spotlight, but if you have an electronic file handy I would be most grateful.

Kay,
 
Do you have a status on this?  We have a deal in the works that would require us signing their paper.
 
Please let me know.

Kay,
 
We need to incorporate the following components into the Genuity Solutions Inc. Master Agreement:

We need a parent guarantee from Genuity Inc. ($10MM) and are willing to reciprocate (Enron Corp. $10MM).  We need to insert Events of Default with respect to guarantor. (Credit Support Annex section 4 and 5 from our MSA) 
We need to insert netting (MSA section 6.4) and close-out setoff (MSA section 5.7). 
We need to insert the ability to request financial statements from the Guarantor if they are not publicly available (MSA section 8). 
The assignment language needs to be re-amended.  Both parties can only assign to an affiliate that is at least as creditworthy as the existing - i.e. we need to maintain the parent guarantee. (MSA section 10.4). The current amendment is unclear whether or not Genuity is the only party allowed to assign to an affiliate. 
We need a bilateral bankruptcy event of default. (MSA section 5.1(iv)). 
There is no clause regarding disputes of invoices.  We can use our standard language from the MSA.(Section 6.3). 
Do we need to state that we are a forward contract merchant?

Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Jane Wilhite

Sounds fine.  I have a copy of what I believe to be the current master, and the confirm states that  a revised master is anticipated, and if signed, may govern the transaction.

Arshak - We will approve this transaction with Genuity Solutions Inc. 

Please note - before any additional transactions with Genuity Solutions or Genuity Telecom occur we must amend the Master Agreement.  CRM does not approve of the form for the Master Agreement with Genuity Solutions, Inc.  There are no events of default with respect to EBS, we need to incorporate set-off language between the two affiliates and we need to push for a parent guarantee.

Molly - please attach these comments to the confirmation for the file. 

Lance - Can we get somebody in legal assigned to help amend this agreement? 

Thanks,

Yes, but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate. By the way, it was certificate #2, so I changed the language in the power to reflect that.
