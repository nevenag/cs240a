Pompano Beach and Deerfield BeachAir Permitting Update I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges so we would need a better reason  Do we have anything else to go on  I dont think the Margate issue is enough either I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of December which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until January

Pompano Beach and Deerfield BeachAir Permitting Update Kay Steve Ben and Debbie --I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP is intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings into a single proceeding  To that end  Martha believes that the proceedings should be heard sometime in January 2002 depending upon which of the cases is consolidated into the other  Martha believes that consolidation is appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are consistent and that for evaluation purposes the DEP considered the sites as one   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted our position on the proposed consolidation  I told her that we would likely oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing our position Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages    The cases if consolidated may be less expensive to try  Yet the hearing in December may be at risk if consolidation occurs    In addition the parties are not exactly the same in each proceeding  Margate is not a participant in the Deerfield proceeding  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible with Enrons position on the proposed consolidation   If she does not hear back from me soon then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate that Enron objects to the consolidation Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enrons response to DEPs Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit   I promised not to file any response last week given the pending settlement negotiations but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation --Kerri     The information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information

some different language for your consideration WHEREAS the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage because i of its failure to among other things provide drawings with adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and ii excessive vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such damage  As a result Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to Siemens Westinghouse in May of 2001 under the Contract in the amount of Four Hundred Nine Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars 40966600 for repair work performed on two of the stacks Warranty Issue I hope this gets us there Thanks Kay -----Original Message-----From Davis Ann E mailtoAnnDavisswpcsiemenscom Sent Thursday October 04 2001 805 AM To Mann Kay Subject RE Settlement agreement Kay We are in receipt of Enrons proposed changes to the Settlement Agreement and Release on the Gleason Project  Unfortunately it appears that the intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial discussions between our respective business representatives   In past discussions with Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of the Gleason CT exhaust stacks Enron tied its local low frequency noise concerns to the stack reconstruction issue  Although the causes for reconstruction of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities SWPC agreed that in the interest of continued customer relations we would be willing to make a business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in exchange for indemnification on future stack and noise issues The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references to the noise issues in the warranty definition thereby eliminating any coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that issue from the Settlement Agreement  This elimination substantially erodes the value of Enrons indemnification and the settlement overall  As modified the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC and it is in our best interest not to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron  Should Enron be willing to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph SWPC would be willing to sign on to the deal Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further  SWPC would like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron but we will not make payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no responsibility unless such payment is part of a more global settlement Regards Ann Davis Counsel Siemens Westinghouse

mailtoKayMannenroncom Sent Tuesday October 09 2001 1119 AM To Davis Ann E Subject RE Settlement agreement Hi Ann Thank you for your response I wanted to propose some different language for your consideration WHEREAS the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage because i of its failure to among other things provide drawings with adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and ii excessive vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such damage  As a result Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to Siemens Westinghouse in May of 2001 under the Contract in the amount of Four Hundred Nine Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars 40966600 for repair work performed on two of the stacks Warranty Issue I hope this gets us there Thanks Kay -----Original Message-----From Davis Ann E mailtoAnnDavisswpcsiemenscom Sent Thursday October 04 2001 805 AM To Mann Kay Subject RE Settlement agreement Kay We are in receipt of Enrons proposed changes to the Settlement Agreement and Release on the Gleason Project  Unfortunately it appears that the intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial discussions between our respective business representatives   In past discussions with Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of the Gleason CT exhaust stacks Enron tied its local low frequency noise concerns to the stack reconstruction issue  Although the causes for reconstruction of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities SWPC agreed that in the interest of continued customer relations we would be willing to make a business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in exchange for indemnification on future stack and noise issues The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references to the noise issues in the warranty definition thereby eliminating any coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that issue from the Settlement Agreement  This elimination substantially erodes the value of Enrons indemnification and the settlement overall  As modified the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC and it is in our best interest not to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron  Should Enron be willing to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph SWPC would be willing to sign on to the deal Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further  SWPC would like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron but we will not make payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no responsibility unless such payment is part of a more global settlement Regards Ann Davis Counsel Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation 4400
