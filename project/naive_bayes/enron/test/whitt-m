19 2001  Report Enron CFO Reaped Millions from Partnership  By Stephen Taub  Talk about the appearance of a conflict of interest  A limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow CFO at Enron Corp since  1997 racked up millions of dollars in profits from transactions conducted  with the energy company according to The Wall Street Journal citing an  internal partnership document  The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals with Enron in  ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk of losses  Fastow and his partnership associates are said to have racked up more than  7 million in management fees and about 4 million in capital increases  last  year The huge sums came from their investment of nearly 3 million in the  partnership LJM2 Co-Investment LP the Journal claims  The limited partnership was set up in December 1999 mainly to do business  with Enron and big-time investors include Wachovia Corp General  Electric  Cos General Electric Capital Corp and Credit Suisse First Boston  according to the account in the paper  The gains from the deals were revealed in a report to partnership  investors  dated April 30 which was signed by general partner Fastow says the  Journal  Enron officials had no comments for the Journal in regard to the LJM2  partnership document However it would seem there might be some concerns  as  Fastow as Enrons CFO has fiduciary duties to Enron shareholders  On Tuesday Enron stunned investors with the announcement that it had  taken  a 101 billion charge in the third quarter due mostly to write-downs of  lousy investments resulting in a 618 million loss for the three-month  period  Downgrades Up Upgrades Down  According to Moodys Investors Service credit rating downgrades of US  corporations far exceeded upgrades in the third quarter In a press  release  Moodys noted that the ratings of 125 companies were knocked down in the  quarter while only 43 corporations received credit upgrades This is the  14th consecutive quarter that downgrades have exceeded upgrades  Among junk credits 93 issuers were downgraded--versus only 19  upgrades--in  the third quarter The ratings news wasnt so bad for investment-grade  firms however which experienced 32 downgrades versus 24 upgrades  Recently Moodys reported a third-quarter surge in junk defaults The  hardest hit sectors were airlines telecommunications motor vehicle  parts  and chemical companies while the strongest sector was oil and gas  Moodys senior economist John Puchalla said an increase in risk aversion  a  loss of revenues and the potential changes in demand away from travel and  tourism-related industries have weakened credit quality since the  September  11 terrorist strikes  Moodys also pointed out that most aggregate measures of corporate debt  protection remain stronger now than in the late 1980s and early 1990s  The  much stronger credit position of financial institutions also diminishes  the  likelihood of a broad-based credit crunch noted a Moodys press release  The press release also stated that the lowest short- to intermediate- term  borrowing costs and one of the biggest infusions of fiscal stimulus since  the mid-1960s as well as the fastest annual expansion of M2 or financial  liquidity since 1983 signal the return of above-average expenditures  growth by 2002s second half  Read

Gas Turbine Power Plant Project ENA and Crestone Northern Borders non-regulated affiliate met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer Secretary of State in Wyoming who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant expandable to 500 MW in the Powder River basin of Wyoming  Their angle is that the existing utility Powder River Electric Coop cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin As you may or may not know Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOPs certificated territory in the next couple of weeks There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this retail market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market  However they seem to have some political backing These developers recognize that they need Enrons assistance in developing this project on three main fronts 1  Power Marketing and Project development 2  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3  Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further Therefore I am wondering if I could get a Sr Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions  I dont want to make this email a novel Thanks a lot 303-575-6473

the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

Gas Turbine Power Plant Project ENA and Crestone Northern Borders non-regulated affiliate met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer Secretary of State in Wyoming who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant expandable to 500 MW in the Powder River basin of Wyoming  Their angle is that the existing utility Powder River Electric Coop cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin As you may or may not know Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOPs certificated territory in the next couple of weeks There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this retail market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market  However they seem to have some political backing These developers recognize that they need Enrons assistance in developing this project on three main fronts 1  Power Marketing and Project development 2  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3  Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further Therefore I am wondering if I could get a Sr Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions  I dont want to make this email a novel Thanks a lot 303-575-6473

the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub
