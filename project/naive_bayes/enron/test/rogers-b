and what he did to earn the difference Same question could be directed to Bush the elder But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and declare a truce we may see some overdue action on the control of financial derivatives These are the investments often off the books in futures and currencies that slice and dice risk and have made instant billionaires but whose abuse has been disastrous to investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital Management Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk in reality they are often used to make huge bets unknown to their institutional investors Accountants are supposed to enforce disclosure of all liabilities but many have become expert in the concealment of risk I dont profess to understand the worries some of my financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the convertible bond market swaptions and ever-narrowing derivatives But my unwillingness to break my head learning these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge Complication and secrecy are mothers milk to them while the average investors best protection is full disclosure When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global Crossing you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who like to work in the dark For too long new-economy corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden risk in arcane off-the-books dealing The new SEC chairman Harvey Pitt seems not to get it Stop pretending its a political scandal and start dealing with the accounting and derivatives scandal httpwwwnytimescom20020221opinion21SAFIhtmlex1015395556ei1en2af09e94be84eaa6 HOW TO ADVERTISE ---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web please contact onlinesalesnytimescom or visit our online media kit at httpwwwnytimescomadinfo For general information about NYTimescom write to helpnytimescom Copyright 2002 The New York Times Company
