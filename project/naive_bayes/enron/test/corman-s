State Depts Foreign travel requirements section for Kaz showing a different HIV requirement Any idea what the Russian laws are with respect to HIV testing  We were not asked to show proof of HIV testing to obtain Kaz visas or anytime to our knowledge that we were in Kaz  However we were asked by the consular staff at the Russian Embassy in DC to show proof before they would issue our visas  It took three trips to the Russian Embassy to get our visas -- so its possible the guy was just giving me the run-around -- but Id be curious to know what the law says since Kaz families must return

We stayed in a hotel during our stay in our sons adoption city and then had an apartment during our stay in Almaty  We personally loved having an apartment - it was our time with our son - we were able to start being a family and doing family things - playing cooking cleaning etc  Our life began together immediately - I think and I dont know since we didnt do this if you were with a host family -it would put a different twist on the situation  Not saying good or bad - just different  Kind of like when you visit someone and stay at their house vs renting a hotel room  You can be more open when you are with your own family Best wishes on your adoption journey  Cyndi Message 7 Date Tue 16 Oct 2001 092222 -0400 From bbrierefamilyjunocom Subject Re Re HIV Testing and Russia I find all of

Accommodations in Kaz Id like to share the experience we had in Karaganda  We stayed with a family in a small apartment adjacent to their own apartment  It was a wonderful way to get our new son used to family life as well as have Russian speakers nearby to ease the transition to living with English-only speakers The particular family we stayed with consisted of a grandmother retired schoolteacher who was there ALL the time  Babushka cooked all our meals as well and she and I became close friends even though she spoke only Russian and I only English  The father was an engineer by training but was currently doing much of the document running necessary for the adoptions processed by our facilitator  The mother was an earnosethroat doctor and there were 2 children 17 year old boy who spoke wonderful English and acted as our translator - for a fee of course - and his 10 year old sister I would encourage anyone who has the option of staying with a family to do so  It helps to see how families live over there as well as observe first hand how food is served  They eat the same sorts of food we see all the time here but serve it differently  That knowledge alone was wonderful to have when our son first came back  I fixed the food in the manner he was accustomed to seeing it served  He now eats the way we do big plates and cooked in our way and hes been back since 1 March this year

SDKsmithworldnetattnet Subject Hi Everyone The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities  Of course thats cuz we havent had one here in a week  But it is so typical for our kids to be set off by something that seems so simple and then they end up hating themselves I call it a hate fest and being self abusive  Karly has told me during her tantrums that she is going to run away or kill herself and she hits herself too  How Kaz of heryet her therapist says shes processing everything well and doesnt need to be seen every week  But it still is a worry for the future Heres a question  If the kids are tantrumming and abusing themselves doesnt that show guilt and self hatred  Even though Kira doesnt feel bad about drinking the soda doesnt she feel bad for doing a wrong thing  Is the problem that she doesnt feel bad for hurting and disappointing the family  Is this just misplaced guilt Here is an idea and it is just an idea about the conscience thing The current behavioral theory with normal children is to discipline and consequence inappropriate behaviors without expressing anger so kids dont feel shame or guilt  So would a way of teaching guilt include the parent sharing feelings of sadness and disappointment at the behaviorFor instance when Kira is calmed down or at a later time can you share your sadness that she lied to youCan you on a regular basis model different feelings it is totally hard for me NOT to model anger and frustration  Just an idea What do the professionals who you all are working say about conscience Shannon just once in a while Karly has a positive feeling about her first family such as when her birth parent bought her koolaid-wow theres a real  great parent huh  Anyway I point at that its good that at least she has ONE good memory about her but when she begins sentimentalizing  she is reminded that the nice kool aid lady also left her alone for hours beat her screamed at her and cut her with a knife  This way I figure she has a balanced perspective See you all later Denise Non-text portions of this message have been removed Message 11 Date Tue 16 Oct 2001 185033 -0000 From dazzlegtenet Subject Re HIV Testing and

post directly to the list in hopes that I can share our experience We adopted our son now 3 from Taraz in August of 2000 using Kids FirstFrank Foundation In answer to alot of your questions We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow that flight was 10 hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest  Our flight to Almaty left at 11pm  We arrived in Almaty after a 3 hour time difference and I believe the flight was about 3 hours as well so it was about 4am Almaty time  Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our coordinator the sun was just coming up  We then went to her flat to rest some more and eat breakfast  Although it seems like we had alot of time to rest it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us adjust to the time change  We then went to the bank to get money that had been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night I believe we got to the train station about 5pm for the train to leave about 6pm  We had our own cabin that had 2 padded benches with clean linens plenty of pillows a table and a window  We were able to store our luggage under the bences  The door to our cabin locked from the inside and we felt completely safe the entire time  We took alot of video footage of the towns we went through  There were people that would try to sell stuff at each of the stops  Everything from bottled water to fried chicken  The bathrooms were not the greatest on the train but when you have to go you take what you can get although they were better than any port-a-potty I have ever been into here in the states  Although I didnt visit other areas on the train one of the people we were traveling with did and said you will see all sorts of people that are in non-private cars but nobody ever bothered us We arrived at the Taraz train station around 4am and were met by the driver of the orphanage with his van  We were brought to our host families flat to get settled and then went to the orphanage to meet our son  Each day we were able to visit the bobek for about 3 hours in the morning and 2-3 hours in the afternoon  Our court experience was short and non-eventful  We were able to have dinner with the orphanage director at a restraunt by her flat  We were able to go to the store everyday for bottlednoncarbonated water and beer too  We also visited the internet cafe which is just down the street from the telecom building  It was very inexpensive  We ate at a few restraunts in Taraz as well and never got sick  One gentleman got sick from drinking some bad vodka but said it was just like he drank something that didnt agree with him he vomited once and was fine The train ride back to Almaty left about the same time and we had no worries with our son  We made a bed for him on the floor between our benches and he slept the entire time  Another couple I know made a bed for their infant in their small suitcase ontop of their clean clothes so the child wouldnt roll around One thing I cant express enough was the CHILDRENS CHEWABLE DRAMAMINE  It is perfect and the last thing you want is a vomiting toddler on the plane  It is messy and awful Also take lots of pictures  While putting together my sons scrapbook of our journey to get him I realized I hadnt taken pictures of things that now are important If you have any

cons of changing our soon-to-be-sons birthdate back a year We held each child back 1 year in school from their American age peers but did NOT change their actual birthdates Initially I felt strongly that we should change their birthdates by 1 year -- but Jackson felt VERY strongly that we should not  His logic was that after we opted to change their Russian and Kazak names -- the only thing they brought with them from Kaz was their birthdates The school district initially placed a GREAT deal of pressure on us to place them with their age peers but we resisted and basically demanded that they be placed back 1 year -- which was within our rights to do -- although the school district tried to convince us otherwise  They kept telling us that ESL would catch the kids up soon enough -- but given the fact that neither child had much formal education we didnt feel starting them in 2nd and 4th grade was in their best interest So although our kids were 8 and 10 years old when they came home in April of 2000 we started them off in 1st and 3rd grade  The kids then attended 1st and 3rd grade summer school -- and we moved them on to 2nd and 4th grade in September 2000 just over 4 months after they came home Academically and socially they were really still about a year behind their classmates maybe more when they started 2nd and 4th grade last year -- but by the end of the school year they were almost working at grade level and were nearly on par socially with their classmates In terms of their sizes which was a MAJOR driver behind holding them back 1 year -- I would say they were about in the middle of their classes in terms of their heights and weights when they started school  HOWEVER after being home for 16 months -- BOTH kids were at the 60th percentile for height for their AGES -- making them two of the tallest kids in their grades I dont have the exact figures on how much they grew -- but we know that in the first 18 months after Nicholas left the orphanage he grew more than 7 inches and Kira grew more than 6 inches and gained 11 pounds the first year home We did initially consider holding them back 2 years from their age peers when they came home -- but we are VERY VERY glad now that we didnt do that  If we had held them back 2 grades instead of just one BOTH kids would have TOWERED over the other kids right now Academically they would have been better off but socially it would have been disasterous  As it is now the kids look noticeably bigger than many of their classmates -- which is incredible given how small they were compared to most of the other kids when they came home Anyway this is what we did Laura Message 18 Date Wed 17 Oct 2001 003423 GMT From lnhovaccom Subject RE birth dates  We gave our youngest a two year discount -- which

about the size of a 3 12 year old As far as I know she has not gotten any formal schooling yet where she is even though she would be in Kindergarten or 1st grade here by now I want her to have every advantage to get the most out of her experiences in life and feel that she will be best served by allowing her to be the same age as other children that are closer to her size and developmental level

httppersonalsyahoocom Message 21 Date Wed 17 Oct 2001 014012 -0000 From adopt101aolcom Subject Re birth dates The hardest part about this decision and the one I think some people dont think enough about is what the childs situation is likely to be 2 or 3 years down the road Nicholas was at about the 25th percentile for height given his bio age when we brought him home -- but is now -- less than 18 months after coming home -- at about the 60th percentile for height  When we brought him home he looked to be about 7 or 8 years old -- but now looks every bit his 11 years old Kira was about the size of a typical American 4 year old when we first met her in NovemberDecember 99 although she was 8 years old  She barely wore a size 6 when we brought her home in April 2000 and looked by then to be about 5 or 6 years old  Now less than 18 months later -- she looks like any other 9 year old -- and looks noticeably older than many of her classmates -- some of whom are almost 2 years younger than she is now We NEVER would have believed how much the kids would grow and change in such a short time -- and Im sure its hard for other parents to imagine as well  However I also know what we experienced doesnt happen in every case and that many kids remain small or about the same size as their younger classmates  Knowing what will happen in any individual case is pretty much guessworkbut you should think about how you will handle a situation in which your child is significantly older than his or her classmates -- but does not have the academic strenght to skip a grade later on Message 22 Date Tue 16 Oct 2001 220103 -0400 From McCarthy LynnMcCarthy1mediaonenet Subject Birth date adjustments Just our two cents worth about changingnot changing birthdates  We chose NOT to adjust our sons age because he was already showing signs of being on the tall side - even for a Kazak  Liam was 8 birthday is 17 Oct when I brought him home on 1 March this year  Within a couple of weeks of coming home he was placed into a first grade in an Arlington VA public school with ESL classes for 2 12 hours every morning  This provided 2 things for him  1 he was placed with an age group that matched his social development plus 2 he was still getting ESL  We found Liam was reluctant to mix with any neighborhood children until he started school and socialized with American kids Since we have relocated to the Jacksonville FL area Liam has entered second grade in Clay County  Here the ESOL classes are total immersion so that he is in with children from a variety of cultural backgrounds but they are allowed to only speak English in the classroom  He is also taken for special work with the Title 1 teacher as are some of the other children who lag behind in reading English andor math Weve noticed considerable growth in Liam over the last seven months in terms of height and maturity  If he catches up academically we may consider skipping a grade  However we dont make much of a deal over the year or two difference between he and some of his classmates  He is by the way not the only one his age in his class  Guess we feel as Laura said earlier that his birthdate was really the one thing that was all his from Kaz and it is as much a part of his identity as his brown eyes and warm smile Lynn Non-text portions of this message have been removed Message 23 Date Tue 16 Oct 2001

entered into lightly  I had a 14 year old in my classroom this summer who came from Russia when he was 10  Aside from a bit of lingering awkwardness with some aspects of writing their was remarkably nothing socially to separate him from his classmates and in math he was very proficient  On top of this he was from a household where the parents spoke almost entirely Russian around the house Message 24 Date Wed 17 Oct 2001 024423 -0000 From adopt101aolcom Subject Re birth dates Could someone please clarify what is meant by changing their childs age  Since their true age is part of their adoption records and visas I assume that you just mean to let them believe they are a different age Some parents legally change their childs age at the time of adoption in Kazakhstan  From what I understand this is technically impossible to do in Kaz and Russia -- but I do know of parents who did this during the overseas adoption process -- usually to make their child 1 - 2 years younger In other cases parents either tell their child they are a year younger than they actually are -- and the kids believe this -- while in other cases parents discuss it with the child and agree to consider the child a year or two younger Parents in many states also have the option to legally change their childs age at the time of readoption and sometimes can even petition a judge outside of a readoption  Standards vary by state and sometimes by jurisdiction as to ifhow parents can do this -- so its best to talk with adoptive families in your community if you are considering legally changing your childs age  For example I know parents who simply petitioned the court without any supporting documentation as to why the child should be made younger who successfully changed their kids ages -- while other parents had to submit dental medical and psychological records supporting the position that the child was younger than his or her stated age Yet it will be clear to the child immediately if not soon that they are engaged in some sort of deception no harshness intended wont it  Wont they be inclined to want to tell others their true age  Our 5-year old son-to-be was very well aware of how old he was this summer Not necessarily  Many of these kids have no idea how old they are --and some think they are one age but are actually another usually older age  It depends on what the practice is in the orphanage --some recognize birthdays and group kids by age -- while others do little if anything to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids according to age groups  Our kids knew how old they were

John P Willis Mr James S Wyatt Ms Karen L Ziegenfus Subject Closing of ENNEC Department Importance High --Dear Alumns Im sorry to have to convey the bad news that the Penn State administration has decided to close the Department of Energy Environmental and Mineral Economics effective July 1   This decision stems primarily from massive budget cuts confronting the University in light of a significant decrease in state appropriations and of a continuation of increasing costs of higher education  Also despite acknowledged progress in Department accomplishments we are still lagging other EMS departments in major areas such as student credit hours and external funding  Finally it is easier to close a small Department and one that is sometimes and erroneously viewed as duplicating educational efforts in the economics area than it is to close a larger and more unique department in the College Fortunately the University is formulating a plan with many positive aspects for our faculty staff students and with respect to coverage of our fields of expertise  Tenured faculty will be shifting their appointments to other units in the College Meteorology Geography and elsewhere at Penn State Business Ag Econ  The staff has been promised at least equivalent opportunities in EMS  Continuing students will be provided the necessary courses over the next two years to graduate  New educational initiatives in Environmental Risk Management and in Energy Business and new research initiatives associated with Penn States new Environmental Consortium will also serve to continue our intellectual tradition Still there is no way of getting around the news that a wonderful educational entity that has been home to so many wonderful people and has contributed so much to education the State of Pennsylvania and the larger world community will soon cease to exist  Please know that our Department has worked valiantly for many years to amass accomplishments that would stave off such a decision  As Head of the Department over the past fourteen years however I feel that I bear the ultimate responsibility for this outcome  I only wish that I could have done more I regret that I have not kept in better touch with many of our alumns  Recently and facilitated by the ease of using e-mail we had planned to start a semi-annual Alumni Newsletter  The current situation actually makes this even more imperative-the Department may no longer exist but our Alumni Association can prosper indefinitely if we participate actively in it  Let me encourage you to spread the word about our situation to alumns who have not received this communication and to ask them to send me their e-mail addresses for future communications A degree from Penn States Mineral Economics Department or the revamped Department of Energy Environmental and Mineral Economics has served our alumns especially well over the past five decades There is no reason that it should not continue to do so Thanks Adam Rose Professor and Head

John R Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10252001 The Wall Street Journal A3 Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc Enron Corp replaced its embattled chief financial officer Andrew S Fasto w capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock  price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy-trading companies20 Investors appeared worried that Enrons recent woes could have a destabiliz ing effect on the energy-trading market The Houston energy powerhouse wit h annualized revenue topping 150 billion and assets of more than 60 billi on handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nations t raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes In less than two years of operat ion its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for  the energy business and already has handled more than 880 billion in trans actions Enron makes the market Make no mistake about that said Merrill Lynch an alyst Donato Eassey Theres not a trader out there that doesnt use Enron Online As such Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in  which the companys credit-worthiness is critical Enron said its business  operations were functioning normally yesterday The company also has consis tently said it is financially strong and liquid20 Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon the 40-year-old head of the companys industrial-markets division His selection may be intended in part to raise the companys credibility People familiar wit h the matter say Mr McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic ing concerns within the company about Mr Fastows role in running two limi ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac tions with Enron Internal partnership documents indicate Mr Fastow and po ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi ps Mr Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors On Monday Enron announced that the Se curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa ctions20 While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr Fastow as well as the companys dealings with the partnerships controversy over those arran gements clearly played a role in the executives departure In my continue d discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that rest oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO said Ch airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement20 Enron said Mr Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company He  couldnt be reached for comment20 It remains to be seen how much Mr Fastows removal will assuage an increas ingly restive investment community The action came after the 4 pm market close and followed a day in which Enrons stock once again plunged As of  4 pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares were at  1641 down 338 or 17 It topped the Big Boards most active list at ne arly 76 million shares more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ e stock Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800000 shares or more  possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron  stock20 Enrons shares are down about 50 from the beginning of last week Earlier  this year the stock was above 80 a share20 In an apparent ripple effect the stocks of other energy-trading companies which do business with Enron also fell sharply yesterday For instance D ynegy Inc shares on the Big Board were off 545 or 13 at 3726 A num ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc h different than Enrons which rely heavily on complex and highly structur ed investment vehicles20 Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr Fastows departure could be seen as evidence that management does care about investor concerns H owever she adds the move also could be viewed by some investors coming a s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry as an admissi on of guilt Ms Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar gely because of uncertainties about the companys extremely complex financi al structure20 Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings 20 Worries and rumors about Enrons financial strength could be found in the s tock market yesterday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard  people voice concerns about a possible death spiral in which increasing c redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d o business with the company which would in turn weaken its finances and le ad to further business reductions Mr Fleischer a longtime fan who still  has a buy recommendation on the company said he hasnt yet seen any eviden ce of such a problem20 However Mr Fleischer said Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e ntities Enron is facing a problem with trust and credibility Its not ea sy to regain something as basic as trust he said Copyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved 09 BusinessFinancial Desk Section C Enron Ousts Finance Chief As SEC Looks at Dealings By FLOYD NORRIS 10252001 The New York Times Page 2 Column 5 c 2001 New York Times Company The Enron Corporation its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf idence yesterday ousted its chief financial officer Andrew S Fastow who se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin y of the Securities and Exchange Commission20 In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy  as CFO Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive said in  a statement announcing the change Only one day before Mr Lay had told in vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy The company said that Mr Fastow had taken a leave of absence but it also  named his successor Jeffrey McMahon the head of Enrons industrial market s group and a former corporate treasurer20 Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night 20 The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange wh ere Enrons shares fell 338 to 1641 The price has been cut in half si nce Oct 16 when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings A 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi th partnerships that Mr Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning s news release Mr Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo llowed but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate 1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document and were angered wh en they later learned about it20 On Tuesday when both Mr Fastow and Mr Lay discussed the company with ana lysts on the conference call neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr Fastow Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiry in declining to discuss the detai ls of the transactions20 The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year but Enrons disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand 20 By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron  stock it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n ot lead to reported losses but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement That is one of the issues the  SEC whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company is expected t o address20 Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong On Tuesday Mr Fastow assure d investors that the company expects to continue to have sufficient liqui dity to meet normal obligations and said it had bank credit lines that w ere more than adequate20 Mr Fastow was viewed as one of the architects with Jeffrey K Skilling t he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August of the change in bu siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following Its st ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at 907520 According to a person close to the company while Mr McMahon Mr Fastows successor was Enrons treasurer he told Mr Skilling who at the time wa s the chief operating officer that he thought the partnerships involving M r Fastow presented a conflict of interest After that discussion Mr McMa hon moved to a different job at the company this person said20 Shares of Enron traded as low as 1551 yesterday afternoon the lowest pri ce for the stock since early 1995 before recovering In after-hours tradin g they fell to 161420 One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities to drop her rating to sell from hold She had lowered the rating to hold from buy on Mond ay20 After the SEC inquiry was announced she said in an interview yester day evening Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat as a gesture to the Street Now they are replacing him today The timing is a little late but I think it will be received positively by the Street 20 But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way People cou ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team youll never ge t any answers

removed its chief financial officer Wednesday as federal s ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm ent partnerships that he ran20 Enron the worlds largest energy trader said Chief Financial Officer Andr ew Fastow had been put on a leave of absence for an undetermined period a nd named another Enron executive Jeff McMahon as his replacement The com pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d one anything improper20 In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear  to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a s CFO Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock  market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares20 Enron which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons  found itself high on Wall Streets hit list after it released third-quart er earnings on Oct 1620 The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy sts had already expressed displeasure at Fastow with the approval of Enro ns board had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment20 The partnerships which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments20 But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of  Enrons shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time20 So Fastow in June resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e nded its relationships with the LJM entities During the third-quarter Enr on took a 35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity20 Tuesday Lay told analysts and investors that

Enron Corp ENE US was downgraded to market perform from strong buy by analyst William J Maze at Banc of America Baring Asset Managements McClen on Enron Investor Comments 2001-10-25 0809 New York London Oct 25 Bloomberg -- The following are comments by Catherine McClen who helps manage about 17 billion of bonds for Baring Asset Management about Enron Corp Yesterday Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader 35 million McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued by Houston-based Enron during the summer Given what has happened with them basically firing Andy Fastow the CFO theyve finally woken up to how concerned people are about the management-credibility issue On a recent conference call no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors concerns They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has got this inquiry going The fact that two days later Andy is gone and he was in the center is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are Theres always that worry once the SEC gets involved that it could extend You never know what could come of that There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now with the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write-downs Another thing theyre criticized for is their lack of disclosure We still havent seen a balance sheet for the third quarter People are saying why dont you include a balance sheet with your results They promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter Youd like to see just more information on asset write-downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey Wed like to see some clarity answering those sort of questions It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where theyre going to address and clean up their balance sheet and theyve started to replace management Investors have already had enough issues in corporate bonds recently and sometimes investors just think Not another nasty in my portfolio and Id rather exit For certain investors maybe they just get scared I wanted to know more about it People had speculated if it could go to junk I dont think they could because I dont think Enron could exist as a junk company Theres a certain reluctance to sell the bonds You want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think its a buying opportunity --Christine Harper in the London newsroom 44 20 7330-7982 or charperbloombergnet jom Enron ousts CFO amid partnership

the list inve stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha nge Commission inquiry20 It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of  the SEC Prudential Securities Inc analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday W ho knows Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after  the energy trading giants stocks have declined in value each day since Mon days announcement that the

Jeff McMahon wh o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enrons Industrial Markets  group takes over his role20 I think change is good at this particular point in time said FAC Equitie s analyst Robert Christensen said I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered 20 AG Edwards  Sons analyst Mike Heim however said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships20 I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements Heim s aid20 Replacing Fastow alone wont clarify those arrangements he added20 There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans parent to the financial community Heim said Instead of being more trans parent there is more confusion than ever20 Enrons stock continued to plummet Wednesday closing down 338 to 1641  per share a 17 percent decline20 Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week Enrons stock price has slid nearly 52 percent20 The market was asking for that to happen JP Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg in said of Fastows departure This is really the first time Enron has act ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis20 Previously Enrons managers have been cautious and defensive in their app roach he said20 During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern Lay said the  partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles The partnerships have sin ce been dissolved20 The call didnt work for many including Feygin and Heim20 I didnt hear things like weve unrolled all these partnership dealings or heres all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we dont ever expect to take any more charges Heim said What I heard is we dont hav e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed20 The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry third qu arter losses and the August resignation of the companys chief executive of ficer Jeff Skilling have left many analysts questioning the companys fut ure Heim said20 Its really a speculative bet right now but the odds favor the company be ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro m now two years from now he said20 But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors F eygin said20 Feygin said McMahon worked as Enrons treasurer for two years under Fastow  before a disagreement over Fastows involvement in the partnerships caused  McMahon to leave his job as treasurer20 Internally Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in the partnerships Feygin

volume signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing Also Wednesday a raft of  once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock Faced with betrayal on that sc ale Enron management at last felt compelled to act a press release says F astow is taking a leave of absence Hes been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon  formerly CEO of Enrons industrial markets group20 How might the Enron bulls spin this Likely they will point to McMahons a lleged opposition to Fastows role in the big hedging deal called LJM2 to show that the Fastow era is over The Wall Street Journal citing anonym ous sources reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastows possible conflict of interest Probably the fear was that  Fastow couldnt serve Enron and LJM2 equally especially as he was allegedl y making a lot of money from LJM220 Clearly if McMahon turns out to be a new broom thats a positive for Enro n An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journals accoun t of McMahons stance on LJM2 was correct20 Not much else is encouraging however Fastows departure shows that it too k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action On a difficult conference call Tuesday CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back ing It took Wednesdays plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO In oth er words Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers How much fu rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t he company20 The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastows replacement was nec essary to rebuild investor confidence20 Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery People got upset by one shad owy deal but no one knows exactly how the companys core energy trading bu siness makes money Its hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat ion and without the knowledge of the board20 In fact the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad band business The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f rom being in broadband so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t he downside Should the whole board be on the hook too The spokeswoman re sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders20 Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the markets views  Arguably thats downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing Letting things get this bad  has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers It shows an u nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until theyre unavoidable The  spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp arency20 Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated but is it any wonde r people compare this lot to Long Term

examples of lax board oversight still abound One example would be Enron Corp wh ose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities  and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain ou tside partnerships and the companys chief financial officer Ms Minow sai d Where was the Enron board in all of this she asked Boards and outs ide consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these That apparently didnt happen here Taking the corporate governance argument  a step further Ms Minow argued that effective board membership is more th an a theoretical question It should be an issue for investors to evaluate  when they consider buying stock in a company This isnt just a corporate governance thing This is part of investment analysis she said Institu tional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stoc ks Whether they will begin to examine directors as well remained an open question Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long  time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction said Pet er Gleason vice-president of research and development at the National Asso ciation of Corporate Directors which represents more than 3000 corporate  directors Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate direc tors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns More

unfairly pilloried in the press said John Olson an analyst at Sander s Morris Harris in Houston But the weight of circumstantial evidence and  the material stock price decline made this inevitableOlson predicted the CFO swap would improve Enrons credibility with Wall StreetA rough week Enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about  its accounting practices especially in regard to two limited partnerships  created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved Enron said Fastow had taken a leave of absence and that McMahon most recently chairman and CEO of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000 would take over In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would

that it had beco me more forthright and openUnfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawy ers said Olson who has not recommended the stock until recently This c ompany has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street The y have some excellent businesses and they have been carrying some losers Enron has an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in the ir growth

 Oct 24 Reuters - Enron Corp  trying to halt a freefall in its stock pri ce and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street named a new chief financi al officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow who has been linked to tr ansactions now under investigation by government regulators The company  which is the nations largest energy trader said Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon who has been running an Enron  unit and is the companys former treasurer in a bid to restore credibility with investorsFastows departure follows the August resignation of chief executive Jeff Skilling who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after ju st six months on the job Wednesdays change came after Enrons stock fell 338 to 1641 its lowest point in six years to cap off a 13 billion p lunge in market value since the company announced a third quarter loss last week and wrote down shareholder equity by 12 billion in a move related t o the questionable transactions Wall

and  Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest  Wall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it  of not being forthcoming about the matter a problem Enron chief executive  Ken Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon In my continued discussions  with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO he said in a statemen t McMahon who was treasurer from 1998 to 2000 before becoming chief exec utive officer of Enrons Industrial Markets group has a deep and thorough understanding of Enron and the confidence of the investment world Lay sa id The Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke u p about the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangemen ts made by Fastow The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it  which led McMahon 40 to ask for a job change Fastow has denied any wr ongdoing but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues bec ause of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against  the company As recently as a year ago Enron had a stellar image as a cor porate innovator with a Midas touch Its profits and stock price soared as  it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money mac hine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodi ties But some of its new businesses faded a large investment in an India n power plant went sour the California power crises spooked investors and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation There also was grousing from investors that Enrons earnings statements h ad become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility Analysts said th e replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron but no t a panacea for its credibility problems The problems investors are havi ng with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnersh ip arrangements Changing the CFO by itself doesnt really address those co ncerns said Mike Heim at AG Edwards I dont think anyone has a full  understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these  partnerships he said I still have a lot of questions Andre Meade at  Commerzbank Securities said Fastows departure was not unexpected but not  that helpful Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that cle ars up the picture he said Frankly Ken Lay and the board dont have cl ean hands when it comes to these transactions The fear driving the mark et is if this is what we know how much worse can it get said JP Morga n analyst Anatol FeyginCopyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Ri ghts Reserved 09USA Utility stocks drop on

in the world Now its stock is down wall street is be arish and the CEO is gone What went wrong by Mimi Swartz magissuesauthorsmimiswartzphp THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTONS DOWNTOWN feels like th e international headquarters of the best and the brightest The lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c ompanies like Shell and Texaco nearby Enron in contrast throbs with mod ernity The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white b rown Asian Middle Eastern European African as well as American-born T hey are young mostly under 35 and dressed in the aggressively casual unif orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis polo shirts and Banana Repu blic button-downs Almost preposterously fit they move through the buildin g intently like winners Enron is nothing if not energetic A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva tors while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe ople entering from the garage A sculpture of the corporate symbol an E ti pped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi s a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe inated Multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratula ting Enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between e levator banks declares Enrons simple if grandiose goal From the Worlds  Leading Energy Company to    The Worlds Leading Company For a while that future seemed guaranteed as Enron transformed itself fro m a stodgy troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000  It was a Wall Street darling with a stock price that increased 1700 per cent in that sixteen-year period with revenues that increased from 40 bil lion to 100 billion The very mention of the company in energy circles th roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates a firm that provides ma rket intelligence to the energy business This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling a visionary determine d to transform American business Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b y then-CEO Ken Lay Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old  formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then  selling it to refineries and other customers Instead it evolved into a co mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water If you had a risky drilling venture E nron would fund it for a piece of the action If you wanted your megacorpor ations energy needs analyzed and streamlined Enron could do the job If y ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning  power needs Enron was there to build and build Basically if an idea was  new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative Enron wanted the first cra ck And with each success Enron became ever more certain of its destiny T he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo rld and in February of this year Skilling reaped his reward when he succe eded Lay as chief executive officer Enron says Skilling was a great mar riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me ntality of the financial markets The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en d of the twentieth century Like the high-tech companies it emulated Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and in turn the Americ an economy Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a  culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but t he best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh o could see the future versus those who could not The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital With the best and the brightest a company couldnt possibly go wrong Or could it Today Enrons stock trades at around 35 down from a high of  80 in January The press cast Enron as the archvillain of Californias ene rgy crisis last spring and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market A long-troubled power plant pro ject in India threatened the companys global ambitions Telecommunications  in which Enron was heavily invested imploded Wall Street analysts who o nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices Some of the cha nge in Enrons fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer tain times that has afflicted all of American business But the culture tha t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame ENRON JEFF SKILLING SAYS HAD a totally different way of thinking about b usiness-we got it At Enron in fact you either got it or you were gone -it was as simple as black and white It is not coincidental then that th e color scheme of Skillings River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he  once headed Here the living rooms white walls shimmer against the mahoga ny floors Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand In the entry white orchids cascade from a b lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white mar ble There is only one off-color note After almost twenty years Jeff Skil ling is no longer associated with Enron having resigned abruptly after jus t six months as CEO Once Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch Gene ral Electrics masterful CEO as one of Worth magazines best CEOs in Ame rica anointed in 2001 and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc hained adventure junkets in which a friend told BusinessWeek someone cou ld actually get killed Today he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr istmas morning I had no idea what Id let go of Skilling says of all th e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron20 From a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons Skilling clarifies The demands o f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances Divorc ed he lived in a 2200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash er He almost missed his brothers wedding Learning a foreign language-I  never learned a foreign language he exclaims He never once took his youn gest son to school Im interested in the kids You dont do kids in fifte en-minute scheduling Travel You cant go to Africa for a week and get a nything out of it Skilling includes the study of architecture and design  on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs Im not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEOs job he says finally  Then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains it s pragmatic edge It would have been easy to stay he says But that wou ld not have been good for me20 Hes a smallish ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight hand some in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assi duously stolid gaze But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r eporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are  bitterly skeptical of his need for family time His shrug stretches the lim its of his shimmering blue button-down and his matching blue eyes look put upon Im surprised he says that people have so much trouble understa nding this PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni neties couldnt help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfo lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building From nine t o five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the prist ine silver skyscraper to smoke They perched on the chrome banisters or lur ked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad They always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed Whatever people knew about Enron in tho se days and most people didnt know much it was often associated with th at scene Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters  in Houston and there couldnt have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past What macho engineer would have put up with s uch humiliation But this company was a child of another time that period in the mid-eighti es when chaos enveloped the gas business Federal deregulation of natural g as turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies freque ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a v olatile free-for-all The situation was compounded five years later by fede ral deregulation of the pipeline business So it happened that a gentlemanl y gas pipeline company Houston Natural Gas HNG found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation Oscar Wyatts less than gentlemanly firm HNG wa s then run by Lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and Transc o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy His doc toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V ietnam War Lay who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar dly-to Texas brashness had done well enough Thanks to canny expansions H NGs pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat e of Texas HNG fended off Coastal but to protect the company from other takeover atte mpts Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska  pipeline concern called InterNorth one of the largest pipeline companies i n the country at the time Then a funny thing happened HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like  Coastal What the Nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being call ed the merger back in Houston and before long following some particular ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston the companys center of gr avity started shifting toward Texas and shortly after that Ken Lay was ru nning a new company called Enron Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with Enron at tha t time He never fought change He embraced change Lay had won but what exactly did that mean Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had  exclusive use of its pipelines Without new ideas-for that matter a whole  new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s tarted20 LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES Jeff Skilling ha d spent a lot of time in the Midwest and he was self-made-at fourteen he h ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora I llinois His mother would drop him off there every day after school I l iked being successful when I was working and I was smart he told Busines sWeek earlier this year But unlike many of his Enron colleagues Skilling  wasnt deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five oclock he  was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than w hat he would come to call intellectual capital He loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people He graduated from Southern Meth odist University went into banking-assets and liability management-and too k on Harvard Business School where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi s class Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped-up path to American success He joined Manhattans McKinsey and Company as  a business consultant and that is where Ken Lay found him in 198520 It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless  and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked While everyone else was worr ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he al one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses And so in a world w here credit was nearly impossible to come by Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers Enron would not be  a broker but a banker It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the  risk involved And Enron would make money on transactions much like an inv estment bank would Skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling The n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec utives He had a one-page presentation Almost to a person Skilling says  they thought it was stupid Almost After Skilling left the meeting dej ected he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized Lay listened and th en said Lets go The Gas Bank was not an overnight success For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze ns of colleagues who had assisted him In fact he had come upon one of tho se divides that seem to define his life I believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way Skilling puts it today and  even if he is typically immodest he was right Fairly soon after launching  the company sold 800 million worth of gas in a week True to Skillings  character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new He says the joke around Enron was that if a companys CEO was under fifty We were in  And he was in too In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation a new division created just fo r him In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned 11 million in profit  After that says Skilling we never looked back Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldnt work unless it ha d a trading component Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w ould make the project go But by buying and selling enormous quantities of  gas Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin ate it The company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the b est access to supplies That in turn attracted more customers who wanted  to be part of the play With so many customers in its pocket Enron could b etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p rice of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but wi th startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could  have ever imagined THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m ade He created within Enron a new culture to match its new trading busin ess The idea was to build a knowledge-based business which demanded a s kill set not exactly prized by Enrons employees from the old HNG days Mos t were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most o f them men of course-the kind of people youd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government But now the company needed b older people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make  money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains The peo ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had na rrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people He wanted the s martest people from schools like Harvard Stanford and maybe Rice And be cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he  wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big gest and best investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B oston In addition to being smart Enron people were also supposed to be a ggressive You were right for Enron if you didnt want to wait until you w ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization20 You could see what he was looking for on Super Saturdays at the Houston h eadquarters eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts their problem-solving a bility their passion for hard work and what at Enron was called a sense  of urgency People who scored less than 25 were scratched The shrewdest  candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired These were t he types that automatically turned down the companys first offer knowing  Enron would come back with more The starting salary was around 80000 Ma ybe it wasnt a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus about 20000 was more  than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof ts being renovated close to downtown Enron people didnt live in far-flun g suburbs Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office For the lucky winners Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a nd-talented program New associates learned the latest techniques for struc turing energy deals and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g lobe The hours were long but every possible need was taken care of A com pany concierge handled all the things important people couldnt be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning th e house planning a vacation Of course a lot of people who worked for Enr on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou ld use the company gym and the companys personal trainers If they were ov erweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join Enrons Wellness Progra m Massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until t en at night They were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time They really thought about th e psychology and what it took to keep these people going Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts  associates directors and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos e titles didnt really matter Money did Instead of competitive salaries a nd decent bonuses Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus es-with no cap If you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says Ken Rice who stayed with Enron for 21 years un til resigning recently as the head of the companys faltering broadband div ision Or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed Gas traders  with two or three years of experience could wind up with a 1 million bonus  And the more you produced the closer you got to Jeff Real hot dogs join ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia Land Cruiser racing in Australia or of f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1000 race ending at a sp ectacular Mexican villa Every time hed speak Id believe everything he d say one loyalist says20 And why not By 1995 Enron had become North Americas largest natural-gas m erchant controlling 20 percent of the market But at a company where the b uzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop Skilling and Lay belie ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv ice at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for Enron they bega n barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power compa ny presidents who with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se rvice areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who wer e somewhat more receptive thanks in part to Enrons generous lobbying effo rts But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling In 1997 Ken Lay m ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company By then  the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity The divisio n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from  2 billion to 7 billion Mr Skillings experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the New  York Times noted Everyone would certainly have thought so Enron and Skill ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran sforming another FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within sang the New York Times in 1999 In the staid world of regulated utilitie s and energy companies Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis crowed For tune in 2000 Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl e and Enron in 2000 obliged with second quarter earnings of 289 million  up 30 percent from the previous year That year the company seemed to dis cover a market a minute Under Skilling Enron was trading coal paper ste el and even weather No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client People drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedg e against the usual winter downturn But most exciting to the financial world was Enrons entry into high-tech c ommunications Because of the companys marketing dominance EnronOnline be came another overnight success handling 335 billion in commodity trades o nline in 2000 Enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bi d price and the asking price Then there was the broadband business To Enr on trading excess capacity in large high-speed fiber-optic networks empt y lanes on the fabled information highway wasnt that different from tradi ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines So Enron created a market for wha t the industry calls bandwidth Soon after it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes Enron looked like a company that couldnt lose Its strat egy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commo dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market BusinessWeek insis ted There was however another reason Enron did so well in such a short time  the companys hard-nosed approach toward its customers The old notion of c ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust omers to keep them But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t o come to it Over time the company stopping referring to its business cli ents as customers and began calling them counterparties Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable Gains were m aximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur e quickly-such as Zilkha Energys new high-tech approach to drilling for oi l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un derwrite the project if it ever would But because Enron invented its mark ets and subsequently dominated them Enron could set the terms of its deals  from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene d at all20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as mark-to-marke t accounting for instance Enron used it on an unprecedented scale The c ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enrons idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didnt ge t deals And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an nuities over a period of years Enron took most of its profit up-front How ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year If a few analysts thought there mig ht be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting inves tors didnt particularly care as long as the profits rolled in As the mark et fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a projec t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins werent  going to be high enough Enron is known for leaving people at the altar  says one former employee Winning the highest possible profits for the comp any could even extend to Enrons attitude toward charity When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission a literacy group called on Enron for a c ontribution it was suggested that he start raising money for Enrons compe ting literacy charity Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron he says As Enron became more and more successful the culture Skilling had created  took on a dark side The competition turned inward As one member of the En ron family put it It became a company full of mercenaries The change st arted at the bottom As Enrons domination of the energy market grew most  of the recruiting frills fell away New associates were treated much like t he commodities the company traded Global Changes Enron spies reported ove rhearing orders like I need a smart person-go buy me one or Buy me an in telligent slave quick Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl e sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa rody A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months It was to o disruptive People couldnt get their work done And of course Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension  The Performance Review Committee which had initially been installed by S killing in the Capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking s ystem in the country Employees were rated on a scale of one to five and t hose with fives were usually gone within six months The PRCs nickname qu ickly became rank and yank It was a point of pride that Skillings divi sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year As one Skilling assoc iate put it Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store Skillings approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro ns attitude toward its workers In time it would become many workers att itude toward the company Teamwork never that valuable in a trading cultur e went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus If protocol required an Enr on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World he might help-or he might not depending on whether another potentially m ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed  They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s ight of the future says one former employee Anyone who couldnt close de als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores as were the higher-u ps who had backed them Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase No old tapes became a n Enron clich People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former Enron executive In such a hothouse paranoia flowered New contracts contained highly restr ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company E-mail was monitored A former executive routinely carried two laptops on e for the company and one for himself People may have been rich at Enron  but they werent necessarily happy One recruiter described the culture thi s way They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y ou bleed to death BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the worlds leading energy  company into the worlds leading company he had to make one more change J ust as he had done ten years before Skilling had to purge the company of i ts remaining old order Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea lt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who d ealt with intangible assets Pipelines power plants-they may have been Enr ons pride but Skilling wanted them gone Expensive long-term building pr ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm ous returns on investment capital and Skilling knew it It wasnt the tim e for long-term approaches an Enron executive says of Wall Streets mood It was the technology era To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past Skilling had to take on Rebe cca Mark long considered his rival for the CEOs job Mark was for many ye ars the poster child for the Enron way Young attractive aggressive-her n ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th e requisite Harvard MBA Mark was largely responsible for the success of En ron International the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed  20 billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for 40 percent o f Enrons profits in 1998 For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on e Enron executive estimated 10 million-and adoring press clips including  two appearances on Fortunes list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo rate America But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol Indi a one of the largest ever constructed She had played the game the Enron w ay Taking Enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes 20 p ercent instead of the usual 53 and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c hanges in government But the time and expense needed to make India and oth er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enrons goals  and Skillings impatience with Mark grew Forcing Mark out however was no easy matter Key executives left divisio ns were dismantled but she remained The truth was Enron didnt mind firin g lower-level employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relen tless people it tended to promote The company preferred humiliation-keepin g a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title One particularly d ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis A company a s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa ster So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian They gave Mar k her own company Despite Skillings contempt for asset-heavy businesses  Enron spent more than 2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti lity that could serve as Enrons entry into the emerging world of water pri vatization Mark was put in charge of making Enron yes the worlds greate st water company Azurix as the new business was called looked like anoth er sure thing Its IPO in 1999 raised 695 million20 But Mark had to succeed on Enrons increasingly abbreviated timetable in a  business fraught with political and emotional complexities Water is not li ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money The company stumbled layoffs commenced an d confidence evaporated By August 2000 the stock price which had started  out at 19 had fallen to 5 Marks resignation followed and Azurix much diminished was folded into Enron I think its best for Rebecca to start afresh Lay who had been a mentor to Mark told the Wall Street Journal Or as one critic put it They were more interested in destroying the old  culture than running a business20 As 2000 drew to a close Skilling was in total command In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable The best time for the succession to occur is wh en the company is doing well he told the press Enron is doing extremely well now In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEOs job ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED Enrons domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac le Both PBSs Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron portraying t he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington L ay and Enrons political action committee are the top contributors to Georg e W Bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo od or electricity Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent  anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the companys jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif ornia as both tried to buy power online The Times reported that Lay had t ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d eregulation The bad press was to say the least ironic Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence Wall Street was discovering its we aknesses By late March the stock price had slid to 50 a share from 80 in January Within Enron the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline The  India plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of  constant turnover within Enrons management team But the California situa tion was more visible and therefore more damaging despite Enrons claim th at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population  and never properly managed those it had For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us says Mark Palmer a vice president for corpo rate communications We were a Texas company There was a Texan in the Whi te House California was a state that didnt put him in office and his big gest contributor was a Texas energy company Performance is going to take c are of our stock price The truth will take care of Gray Davis Californi a utilities still owe Enron 500 million another reason stockholders might be panicky But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skillings al l too apparent lack of contrition Facing down his critics he cracked a jo ke comparing California with the Titanic At least the Titanic went down  with its lights on But the biggest problem was Enrons telecommunications division which had  been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from 155 billi on in 2001 to 383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst So too d id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster For the first tim e in its confoundingly successful life Enron had nothing new to take to ma rket Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enrons most important cheerleaders t he stock analysts in the tent but he wasnt cut out to be a supplicant D uring the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who chal lenged Enrons financial reporting an asshole When the company reported  hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profit s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse ts Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enrons accounting Skilling pr omised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner Th ere wasnt any positive news Carol Coale of Prudential Financial says n ow Basically he talked me out of a downgrade The business press so generous in the past turned surly Fortune had aske d in March whether Enron was overpriced Start with a pretty straightforw ard question How exactly does Enron make its money The routine cashing  in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray ed in the media as a fire sale Skilling had sold 33 million worth Ken L ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount Then the Wall Street Jour nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with in the company It was essentially risk management against Enrons possibl e failures Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th e stock price By late August it had fallen below 40 Enron so institutio nally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine When Wall Stre et is in love with a stock theyre forgiving of something like accounting  says Carol Coale When a company falls out of favor all these issues ca rry more weight This fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started e xperiencing an attack of conscience Those who had looked the other way as  the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th eir ways It just created an attitude one executive still at Enron says If senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard Th ere was a real culture of Were above everyone else20 Loyalty had never been prized at Enron so there was no reason to expect it now An old-fashioned slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road But as one Houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit h someone who doesnt have loyalty and has money then you have a corporati on thats better suited for good times than bad As it turned out that description applied to Jeff Skilling too As the sto ck price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration Then after a trip to visit the families of three employe es killed at a plant in England he had an epiphany Life was short for hi m Enron was over Ever stoic Ken Lay returned to the CEOs office named  a new president arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors  and promised a kinder gentler Enron in the future Trading anything and  everything was out The company Lay says will still innovate but innovat e much closer to our core As for the culture Things like the Performanc e Review Committee I think we could have applied better By trying to cate gorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a mo rale problem That Skillings supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence Despite Skillings lengthy tenure wi th Enron hed always been contemptuous of the long haul hed always belie ved in cutting losses and moving on But now that he was abandoning them wh en the company was in trouble it was different Even Jeffs biggest detra ctors wouldnt have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits But on the day we meet Skilling is looking forward not back Look he s ays with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron Were my int erests aligned with the shareholders Absolutely Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling hims elf back into the world of ideas His eyes flash as he talks about new tech nologies The first wave never gets it right he says The stand-alone d ot-coms didnt work but the technological applications will create a secon d wave that will change the world Houston he promises will become the w orlds center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it In f act he is already shopping for office space This is the second wave and Enrons got it he says almost breathless  There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g et it

the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merc hant function Option B  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and wou ld prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of th e utility20 After extensive discussion the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional langu age added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may no t be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties  and the States Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the  definition of energy affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affi liates that would be exempt Staff responded that the emphasis is on broade ning the definition to include all energy affiliates and no energy-type m arketing affiliates would be exempt except RTOs The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certai n information to all energy affiliates  The rules do not directly govern energy affiliates but they govern the disclosure of information and the s eparation of transmission employees officers and directors from other busi nesses20 Under the proposal waivers may be requested if operationally required or  under emergency protocols particularly for small systems Gas Pipeline Operational Flow FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October 1120

whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled  This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid Given these operational concerns we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards  While we understand that this work is in response to R00026 we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No 637   Order No 637 requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity  There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day   Further most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability In the spirit of compromise we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases  However under these revised standards all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported  Nonetheless throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards  In this area we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle  This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow  While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls it still preserves the application of the full-day contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers  Flowing day recalls though are a separate issue  Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems overruns imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders  Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards Any move from daily increments of service to partial-day increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system including firm services interruptible services and balancing and operational provisions Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation April 16 2001 Mr David Boergers Secretary Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street NE Office of the Secretary Room 1A East Washington D C 20426 Re               Docket No RM98-10-000 Docket No RM98-12-000 Dear Mr Boergers Enclosed for filing with the Commission in the captioned docket are an original and fourteen 14 copies of Motion to Intervene and Comments of The Enron Interstate Pipelines in the captioned proceeding  Also enclosed are three extra copies to be file-stamped and returned to the messenger  These comments have also been submitted electronically through the Internet e-mail Very truly yours Shelley A Corman Vice President Enron Transportation Services Company For the Enron Interstate Pipelines
