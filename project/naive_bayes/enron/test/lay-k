X-Mailer: AOL 5.0 for Windows sub 138

                   This letter is to ask to please check into the

irregularities that are going on in your company Pro-Caribe in Puerto Rico.

In this company there seems to be preference for two employees which are the

favorites between managment, mr. Roberto Aponte and mr. Rafael Medina.  The

two employees do not work rotating shifts they have a steady day job make

more money than the other employees overtime is always given to them a one

our break while  the other employees have to sit back and are not able to do

anything about it because if they do they will be put on suspension and their

company motto is ," If you dont like it quit".  All the recognitions and cash

prices go to these two individuals they always come out employee of the year

or the trimestrial plant operator and then again there not plant operators.

There is no opportunity for other employees to advance at this site because

of the discrimination and abuses  going on towards them and which is clearly

evident.   Actually these two individuals hold the post that when there is an

incoming ship they have to attend to it but lately this ship is not coming in

as ofthen as it used to and yet this individualsstill earn the extra money

without lifting a finger.   Some of the priviliges they have is that they do

not have to work rotating shifts and   they are off on holidays  meanwhile

the other employees have to work the rotating shifts, work holidays and make

less money.  Please mr. Loy it is in your hands to make justice for the other

employees who work hard and yet they dont seem to be appreciated.  All

promotions and recognitions are based on the fact that the two employees have

bought their way to their current positions by bringing in gifts and taking

their employers out to dinner.  This action which i believe is wrong because

it is just like taking a bribe.   Once again mr. Loy i ask for your help and

hope you will be able to investigate and be able to straighten out this

situation.  I have witness these events and i do not like any type of

discrimination i leave it in your hands.

Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together.

Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another energy company.  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better.

Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.  Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.

I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am sure you will not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities.

Sincerely,

Rick:

As I am sure you have read by now, Jeff Skilling has chosen to leave Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

I want to assure you that Jeff's departure will in no way affect the relationship that Enron has with Microsoft and more specifically MSN.  I have been briefed on the MSNIA project, by my team,  and they assure me that we are on track to meet your Broadband Internet Access roll-out plans in early October.  I look forward to getting more personally involved with Microsoft to help insure that our ongoing relationship and partnership continues to mature and flourish.

I will contact you in the near future to discuss with you this transition.  In the meantime,  if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact my office.

Ken

Hi Michelle -
 
It looks as though this will work quite easily now as the breakfast Ken originally had scheduled will not take place.  I received word from Sue Landwehr that it will be cancelled as it was Republican Governors and they will not now be here.  We'll coordinate an exact time tomorrow.
 
Thanks.
 
Rosie

Subject: Values and Harassment Prevention



Dear Mr. Lay, 

I understand that Cindy Olson talked with you about the harassment prevention training scheduled over the next few weeks.  In past classes, a senior-level business person has emphasized that harassment is not tolerated and is not consistent with Enron's values.   

For this set of training classes, the team asked if you could deliver that message via videotape.  Cindy told me that your answer is "yes." 

I understand that you are scheduled to record an unrelated video on Thursday morning, and that it might be possible to tape this message at the end of that session.  Would that work with your schedule?  If so, I will provide you with talking points and a script.  If another time is better for you, let me know.

Thanks for your help!

Michelle Cash

Dear Pam:

Thank you for your e-mail of August 15th.  It is always a pleasure to hear from former employees.  Thank you also for calling attention to instances which, on the surface, do not appear to be representative of our expectations of Enron leadership.

Part of our continuous improvement involves an on-going review of our management and the diversity of styles therein.  True, not everyone is agreeable to Enron's culture or the many different management styles at Enron.  We do, however, expect all of our employees - not just management - to adhere to our core values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.  These values become even more significant as we continue to grow and expand our scope of business, and more critical as we become a more culturally diverse workforce.

We enjoy our status as one of the best places in America to work according to Fortune and other sources thanks in part to our willingness to examine our organization and make needed change.  Our employee surveys, belief in open communication, and exit interview process for employees choosing to leave Enron are examples of our efforts to seek out feedback and scrutinize the way we do business.  Your feedback will help play a role in that process.

Sincerely,

Ken Lay

Mr. Lay:

Mr. Lay, the I am not writing this in malice but in hopes that it helps get
Enron back the way it used to treat their employees and makes it the number
one employer of choice again.  I hope you can get back the feeling that I
had when I first started there and get the stress level down in your
organization for the sake of your employees.

I am a former employee who worked at Enron for 10 years - my husband was,
at one time, in charge of A/P.  My one big disappointment was that I never
got to meet you.    During that time, I made a lot of friends who I
continue to see from time to time.  I left last year and have missed the
company since I left but would not contemplate coming back unless several
people have been replaced.  (Joannie Williamson and Sheri Sera know my
story.)

I "knew" Jeff but I don't think he knew me by name, only by sight, even
though I worked in ENA when it only had 400 employees with 3 of us in HR.
He was NOT what I would call a people person!  Unless you were in an upper
level position, he did not take the time to find out your name.  (Ron Burns
is still one of my favorite people because of his talent with people - we
need more like him in the business world!)

As you can see, I am now working for a competitor and since I work in HR, I
continually run into former Enron workers who have also left - most of
their reasons are the same.

It is not that they have lost faith in Enron as a company but because of
they way they were treated by their managers.  During the last 5 years I
was there, I noticed a change in direction in the way employees were
treated by upper management - and upper management was getting away with
it.  Not only were they getting away with it, these people were being
rewarded for this behavior.  I have heard stories of lower level employees
being screamed at and in one instance, one of the VP's who was brought down
from Canada was heard in his office screaming and pounding his telephone on
his desk.  Heaven only knows how he treats his subordinates.  Believe me,
the way employees are treated at Enron is being talked about on the streets
of Houston and on the different college campuses.  You might also at some
point take the time to find out why so many good people have left the HR
community at Enron and it is not because they wanted to.

I don't know if you will see this, but I hope so.  Good luck on bringing
Enron back to way it was - I still own stock!!

Thanks for listening...

Pam Allison
