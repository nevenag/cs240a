the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984 but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman  I did not expect to ever join another energy company  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes  And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today  Your professionalism ideas dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible  For this you will not only be a critical part of Enrons history but you will also always deserve Enrons gratitude I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors even as I am sure you will not need my good luck wishes  As always your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities
