 In response to your inquiry regarding EOG,  the correct name is EOG Resources and is not owned nor does Enron have any interests in EOG.  EOG is a separate entity on its own. I am sorry I do not have additional information.

Great,

I drive a 93 Honda Accord that is sort of Purple, so be on the lookout. I
will pick both of you up at 12:00 on Friday the 17th for lunch at Irma's on
me. I will pick you up in front of Enron where they usually have that lunch
party event, or in other words, the side street that has the cathedral on
the opposite side facing the Enron building.

Looking forward to lunch,

    Dear Debra and Gerald,

   Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could
   pick
   you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in
   downtown(they
   have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch,
so
   if
   your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
   Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

   Best Regards,

   Majed Nachawati

Debra,
Here is the spreadsheet for September confirms.

The green column is Mcf and the purple column is MMBtu at the wellhead.

Also, on Kennedy we are pricing her Gas Daily gas on a daily basis throughout the month so I guess we'll have to send her confirm after the month is over. (or state that the "minus number" is determined on a daily basis)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

Cheryl,

I have reviewed the current contracts and deals in place with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. (CP ID 55358) and found that we have deals extending through 08/31/01.  However, the only current deals are with ICC Energy Corporation (an alternate payee under our contract with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. ).  There are NO current deals with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. at this time.

We currently have two master contracts in place as well as two spot GTCs.  I imagine that we will need to terminate all these agreements, but Legal is unaware of any changes with this counterparty.  Darren, can you please provide Stacy Dickson with the name of your contact at Constellation?  

We also do not have ANY master agreements in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc. - all business (telephonic and EOL) is being covered under GTCs.  Stacy or Debra, do we have any negotiations in place for a master under this name?  Darren, can you work with Stacy on this?

Please let me know if we need to terminate or trade suspend the Constellation Energy Source, Inc. agreements.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

Majed and/or Debra,
We have reviewed your comments regarding our Gisb special provisions which
incorporate your provisions.
Attached please find the document with some of our comments.  In particular,
we would like for you to articulate why some of the marked provisions are
outright unacceptable.  I hope that we can work together to create
compromise provisions which will be accetable to all.
Where possible, feel free to suggest alternate or edited language that
solves your objections.
Where entire provisions are unworkable, please give us some indication of
why you have reached that determination.
Also, please find a revised cover sheet atteched as well.
Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss these further.
Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

I have reviewed their comments and need to discuss several matters with them, we cannot agree to some of their revisions on such issues as Force Majeure and credit etc.  Also, with regards to credit issues, the credit department will review and negotiate these. Please have Mr. Bransgrove give me a call.

Subject: ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement with Northern
States Power Company


Patrick:

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreement for Northern States Power Company ("NSP").  I apologize for the
delay.  Our comments are as follows:

Northern States Power Company Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $50,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.7 be increased to $25,000,000 as to each of our companies. 
   
2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change "may" to "shall".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.    

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP
acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose that
the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be
deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be
applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and
the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement.    

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
"establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice."

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase "or deemed to be repeated".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.     

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, NSP is not authorized to
contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.  Please delete
all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement.  

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert "provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, "which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld".
Please modify this provision accordingly.  

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.  

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard. 

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:  

	"Material Adverse Change" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
"Credit Support Provider" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below "BBB-" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
"Baa3", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.   

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.  

Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement
consistent with our comments as set forth above.  Should you have questions
or wish to discuss any of our requested changes, you may contact me via
return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.     

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to
finalize this Agreement.

Subject:	UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses


Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I can't really take a long lunch today, but I was thinking of grabbing something downstairs in the cafeteria.  Would you be open?  We can catch up for a little while.

We are ok with numbers 1 and 2 of your email with one change.  We would like to place "Associated Costs" in the "Appendix" as a defined term.

Let me know if this is acceptable and I will proceed with execution documents.  I should let you know I am currently waiting on my credit dept. regarding any changes to the numbers in the credit sections.  I hope to have an answer by tomorrow.

Debra,

when we had our phone conversation earlier this week, I agreed to obtain suggested language for 4.1 more clearly defining "associated costs" we discussed.  My attorney just got back to me and it is attached.

Hopefully, we are good to go now for execution.  If there is anything else, please let me know

I am in process of finalizing the basic GISB Contract to prepare it for
execution....
However, I need to get a response back from you regarding OUR Special

YOURS & OUR Special Provisions into one document....At that time, I will
forward it to our Legal Dept. for final review as they have to approve it...

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to "one sentence". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and or changes.

 Here are the most frequently used agreements for physical gas trades.  I draft and negotiate both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement as well as ENA's Spot Agreement and GISB.  If you have any questions,  I can explain the process including credits part.  Finally,  the Master Agreement was last revised in September of 1998.  These were minor revisions and I doubt you would ever have occasion to visit the 1998 form.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Debra,

Just spoke with Lupe Gonzales at Kinder Morgan who agreed to amending the GISB Base Contract to make Enron the confirming party.  The customer has not been sending us confirmations in a timely manner.  Details are as follows:

Contract #:  96039682
Contact:  Lupe Gonzales
e-mail: guadalupe_gonzales@kindermorgan.com
Phone #: (713) 369-9427
Fax #: (713) 369-9375

If you would like, you can send me the amendment and I will get it out to Lupe.

Thanks,
Ann

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Please respond via e-mail when you receive this document and if you have any problems opening it or if I can do anything in the short term to assist you.

   Per my voice mail today, attached in the below e-mail is a "red-lined" 
   copy of the Gas Firm agreement which was previously sent to Majed 
   Nachawati. 
   If this revised agreement is acceptable to Enron North America, please 
   forward me original documents for execution. 
   LGE/KU is eager to begin spot trading with Enron; therefore any help you 
   can provide in accelerating this process would be greatly appreciated. 
   I also mentioned in my voice mail that I would forward a copy of this 
   revised agreement to Debra Perlingiere. Unfortunately, the 
   e-mail which I received did not contain her e-mail address. Would you 
   please forward this on to her, if that is where it needs to be. 
   Thank you for your assistance with this matter and I look forward to 
   hearing from Enron soon. If I can be of any additional assistance during 
   this process, please contact me as noted below.

Judy,

I just received back a response from our Legal Dept. on your Special
Provisions you sent me as follows:

1.    Section 1.3		This assumes that the Oral Transaction
			Procedure is selected.

2.     Section 6:		This requires Seller to pay the applicable
taxes,
			etc. levied before and at the Delivery Point.  
			Applicable taxes, etc. levied after that point
			should be paid by Buyer..This is provided for
			in the language deleted, and should be stated.

3.       Section 11.1	References to "Party" should be "party".  This
			substantially limits the application of force
majeure
			situations with respect to third party problems.
			This revision should be rejected.


Judy, please review the above comments and get back with me as to your
comments.

	The enclosed worksheet for Co-Steel was sent up to legal on Oct 24th.  I was wondering when we're can get this draft out because the counter-party is asking for it.  Please advise when we can get this out so I can let Co-Steel know when to expect it.

Debra,

We need to change the pricing verbage. The price should not be 80% of IFHSC. The price for 80% of the volume is IFHSC - .075. Also, the price for the other 20% of the volume is GD - .065 and we should clarify that the GD is Houston Ship Channel. The new well pricing should also be HSC GD - .065. 

Also, I just want to clarify that this pricing is only effective as of January 1, 2002 through the end of the new term. It does not replace or restate the original pricing from the original effective date to the end of 2001. Based on the "replaces and restates" and the "effective date through December 31, 2001" wording, I was not sure. The other changes are effective from the contract effective date, but not the pricing.

Sorry for the confusion. Let me know if you need further information or if we need to discuss.

Thanks,
Judy

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Hi Anthony,

Please run a Sitara report for Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company to see any CURRENT deals pending for this counterparty.  Debra Perlingiere in Legal needs to know who the traders are dealing with this CP, so just spot check your list for about 20 deals.  I realize there are quite a few deals out there, but you can limit the list by running with flow dates from today forward.  Debra needs this information as soon as possible.  If you don't recognize any of the names who created the deal, check people finder.  Most of the book admins should be in the same cost center as the trader.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

 4.5. Termination Offset.  Upon the designation or deemed designation of an=
 Early Termination Date, the Notifying Party may, at its option and in its =
discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Affected Party by the N=
otifying Party or any Affiliate of the Notifying Party under this Agreement=
 or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amou=
nts Owed by the Affected Party to the Notifying Party or any of the Notifyi=
ng Party's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s),=
 instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of the Affected Party an=
d the Notifying Party under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall=
 be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exerci=
sed by the Notifying Party and/or the Notifying Party's Affiliates.  The No=
tifying Party will give the Affected Party notice of any setoff effected un=
der this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provid=
ed that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the se=
toff.  For purposes of this Section 4.5, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed=
 or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have =
been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  Amounts subje=
ct to the setoff permitted in this Section 4.5 may be converted by the Noti=
fying Party into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated a=
t the rate of exchange at which the Notifying Party, acting in a reasonable=
 manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of=
 the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, the Noti=
fying Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respec=
t of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other wh=
en the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be eff=
ective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provi=
ded under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without prejudice=
 and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of a=
ccounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any tim=
e otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). =
 Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in=
 this Section 4.5 are an integral part of the agreement between the parties=
 and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter int=
o Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing thi=
s Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Sect=
ion 4.5, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall recei=
ve the benefits of this Section 4.5 and otherwise be bound as if such Affil=
iates had entered into this Agreement as its relates to Section 4.5.  Notwi=
thstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the N=
otifying Party shall not be required to pay to the Affected Party any amoun=
t under Section 4.5 until the Notifying Party receives confirmation satisfa=
ctory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of i=
ts counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Affect=
ed Party to make any payments to the Notifying Party or any of its Affiliat=
es under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or u=
ndertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fu=

Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

A couple of weeks ago, Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet to you to prepare an Enfolio agreement for Imperial Irrigation District.  I will be forwarding an RFP response to them Friday which is required to include our draft contract.  I haven't received a copy of this draft.  Could you forward this to me at your earliest convenience?

Debra,

I forwarded down to you the subject several months ago. We had a conversation a few weeks ago and you advised me it had been forwarded to someone for review. I still have not seen the documents back and have been advised by OGT that we can not nominate gas on that agreement until we return it to them.

Would you be so kind to check on it.

Thanks.

 I am confused about IGI regarding a GISB draft and an amendment?    Which one  is it?  If we need to amend an existing agreement would you send me the date of the contract etc.
 
With regards to BTA,  I need a contact name address/ email etc.  Do you know whom this might be?

 Many thanks!

We need a written letter from the previous agent regarding transfer to new agent as well as a written document from the new agent consenting to same.  In addition,  the contract party should consent and acknowledge this transfer in written form.

Just a quick check on the Ila Powell change of agent issue I had contacted you on (copy of email enclosed).  Synop-she had contacted us via written request (I faxed a copy to you) to change the agent listed in Counterparty, but the contract is in her name; you were going to let me know what steps she needs to take to correctly change agent from herself to her son.

Subject:	Ila Powell, Agent

Good evening/morning.  I spoke to you last week regarding CPID 33395, Ila Powell, Agent and her request to have the agent name changed.  You had asked me to do some more research and find out what kind of contract we have with her and what she is "agent" for.  I spoke to Susan Ellidge in Contracts and she relayed that Enron has a Committed Reserves Agreement dated 1993 with Ila Powell, contract number 96002428.  The contract is between Enron and Ila Powell and she is listed on the contract as seller (of the commodity) and agent (for the wells involved).

The request we received, which I faxed a copy of to your office, states she wants all information on the wells sent to Dennis Powell, Agent (who is located at a different address/different state than the address we have for Ila Powell in GCP).  It also states she is no longer the agent.  I would like to call her advise her of a proper legal request for change of agent, but I have a feeling there will be more involved than a simple notarized request since there is a contract already in place.  Please advise what steps are needed to make this requested change of agent so that I may contact Ms Powell and relay the instructions in an intelligent manner (I am not legal savvy).

Your expertise and advise are greatly appreciated.

I am in the process of reviewing their comments. We have at issue one agreement or two.  LG&E has purposed one agreement for both LG&E and Kentucky Utilities Company.  For legal and credit reasons this  is not doable.  I await their response on this issue.  Lora Aria has asked me to proceed with my review process setting aside the issue of party names and I am doing so.

Debra -

Is this an agreement that Credit initiated?  How did this agreement get started?  Did Credit specify the credit language written into the document?  

Please forward a copy of the agreement to the above distribution list so that we can review.  I am unfamiliar with this counterparty and therefore very hesitant to transact until we are comfortable with the document's terms and conditions.


Thanks,

Jay

 include the following language beginning in the middle of the section afte=
r ....."contract for each such Transaction and .....(ii) =20

r payment of any amount due under this Article 4, each Party shall pay to t=
he other Party all additional amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreem=

Concerning the "Material Adverse Change" the following is included:

As more fully stated in the Amendment attached below.

If you are in agreement with these changes we can execute the Master Agreem=
ent and proceed with the Amendment.

Should you have questions concerning this matter or any part of the Agreeme=

Can you please help Debra with this request?  I assume she's referring to Tractebel as the parent.  I'm not sure how much business we do with Distrigas.  I would run the contracts for this CP, then run the deals for the contracts, and spot check most of the recent/current ones.

Thanks!

Debra,

I spoke with Darlene Volker of Coast Energy.  She said she received the amendment but we left out "Propane" in the name.  She wants us to send her another amendment with the corrected name (See above for the full name).    You can forward me the corrected amendment and I will get it out to her.  Or if you prefer to do it, then her e-mail address is darlene-volker@coastenergy.com.

Debra, I have reviewed and I believe there are two items outstanding:

1) The new assignment refers to Exhibit A & B - did you mean to leave the
individual sheets marked Exhibit A and make the List Exhibit B? - if so the
list is marked A.

2) I believe there is a confirm missing from the individual prints as well
as the list.- #1148026  Nov-Dec 2001 - Could you check with Sylvia Pollen?


Thank You!  Connie

Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

Thanks

Thank you for sending the WMBE letter for payment
arrangements.  But I forgot to ask you about a follow on
a conversation that we had a few weeks ago about any
language in our Enfolio Agreement that would speak to the
unlikely event that should NDR  go out of business that
the enduser would still receive the natural gas that they
contracted with us for.  This questions is very important
at this time as we are negotiating a term deal with a
major utility in the mid-west. Your timely suggestion or
direction would be greatly appreciated.  You can call me
at 301-516-1636 or by reply e-mail.

There is one additional change to the amendment that you are working on for Jill Zivley for the Aspect, Helmrick & Payne, etc. contract. We need to include a MDQ of 16,000 MMBtu/day.

I plan on purchasing October gas from a new producer, CDX Gas, with offices in Dallas, TX.  The gas is on CGas in West Virginia.  I will be purchasing the gas at a CGas Interconnect.  Pricing will based on Gas Daily. 
Would a GISB contract work for this transaction?

 Yes,  the agreement was under ENA.  The confirmation / contracts are on Stacy's desk for signature. The customer signed the contract/confirm with ENA !!  I question if this is really suppose to be ENA Upstream?    This deal was done with John Singer??  Can you speak with these guys?  Let me know as the contract and confrim has been signed.

The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

Debra,

I spoke with Andrea Dilman of Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. at (713) 215-7673 who said she sent you the GISB amendment with her comments in July and is still waiting to hear from you.  

Also, Idacorp is still waiting for us to send them the GISB amendment.  This is the counterparty that previously returned the amendment to us with a stamp rather than an actual signature.  I think Stacy said she would look into it or get Alisha to work on it.   

Please be on the look out for executed amendments from Midcoast Marketing, Inc. and Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, L.P.  They have both faxed me their copies of the executed amendments.

I gave your business card to Karla Dent of Texaco and asked her to give you a call.  She told me she is swamped because of the pending merger but would give you a call.

Ann

OK guys, I think we have it all figured out now.  Deal 872869 is truly a Crestar deal but the deal should have been input under Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. instead of Crestar Energy Inc. (which is now Gulf Canada Resources Limited).  Elizabeth has moved the deal to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. and the right contract is now attached.  Crestar will now be paid under Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.  as they have billed us.  

I hope this clears up any confusion.  Please feel free to call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Patrice,

An update for you - Steve Van Hooser took this over from Dan but he is out of the office today.  I left a message on his voice mail and will let you know as soon as I hear from him.  I will request copies of the documentation from the Global Counterparty group in the meantime (Cheryl, can you send me a copy ASAP?).

Will keep you posted.

I'm not sure what Dan's rationale was, but he's no longer here to ask.  Maybe we can have Gerald Nemec or Stacy Dickson Granmayeh look into it.  My documentation shows that Crestar Energy Inc. became Gulf Canada Resources Limited due to an amalgamation effective 03/01/01.  I don't have the documentation in hand but I can get a copy from the Global Counterparty group if necessary.  I don't understand why the deal should remain Crestar unless it's really under a Crestar entity that may not have been affected by the amalgamation????

Should deal 821869 be booked under Gulf Canada Resources Limited or should it change to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Is there a point at which these deals will permanently remain under Gulf Canada Resources?  If not, can all future deals be moved over to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Please advise.

I am attaching a revised form of the previous ENA Upstream GISB. Please send this version to your prospective customers. The FM language in the Special Provisions section has been removed.  Also, "DRAFT" and "For Discussion Purposes Only" should remain on the front page when sent to the customer.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  


Thanks
DP

I was did not find Master Agreements for any of the remaining three counterparties on your list from yesterday. I asked Susan Elledge to check also to see if she was able to locate anything that I may have missed. Her findings where the same as mine. If you have any questions please contact me at x36347.

Debra,

Here is the remaining address:

Maria Stateman
BROOKLY UNION GAS COMPANY d/b/a KeySpan Energy Delivery New York
100 East Old Country Rd.
Hicksville, NY 11801

Some of the counterparties were wondering whether we are sending these by regular mail of FEDEX.  I told them, we are probably sending them by regular mail.

Debra,

My contact at LG&E has requested the default pricing in the contract be switched from "spot" to some type of "true-cost" verbiage.  His point was that if he is buying 10,000 on a given day from Enron and ENA only delivers 5,000 by the terms of the present contract Enron would be responsible for the "spot" cost of replacement gas or the gas daily average for that zone.  My contact points out that the market for gas when this purchase is to take place could be significantly higher (or lower) than gas daily and that is the cost they want to pay or receive.  

Is something like this request possible?

Hey Debra,

I have finished the revisions for the regular Masters as well as the EBTIDA agreements.  They are attached; they are also saved in your Contracts 2001 file.  If there are any problems just let me know.  

I also looked for the Hess file and I don't have it, nor do I have any notes for it.  I don't think that I worked on it although I may have looked over it for some reason.  Could you please check and see if you have something for them.

Thanks,

Alisha

Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     " . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand."

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   "must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . "
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

   Ernie

3.5. Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Debra,
Now that we have the Master Firm Agreement nearly signed off on, I'd like
to get the GISB and netting agreements in place as well.  Attached below
are the GISB cover page and Special Provisions that my records reflect we
last agreed to.  I'd like to see Enron's new netting agreement because the
netting agreement previously sent to MW is a year old.  If you have no
changes to the GISB cover page and SP, we should nearly be caught up.  I
look forward to receiving the netting agreement from you.  Thanks.

Jennifer,

per your discussion with myself and Debra Perlingiere, here are the sentences that we would like to add to the amendment you sent us.

"All capitalized terms used herein unless otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Base Agreement."

"This First Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which taken together shall consitute one and the same instrument."



Thanks so much for your patience and understanding on this matter,

Subject:	Guaranty

There is a company that will need to provide us with a guaranty prior to allowing access to trade on EOL.  The guaranty will cover physical NG and physical Power.  Through working with the financial legal team, a format has been discussed that covers multiple products for physical and financial business across multiple Enron entities.  Ideally, this is probably the best format to have a counterparty use.  Pursuant to instructions, I am not sending out a format to this company without having a member of the legal team give me the ok.  I was hoping that we could all coordinate on the multi-product, multi-entity format and possibly use it on a going forward basis.  Thanks for your help and please let me know if there are any questions.

 We cannot enter into  a contract with TXU as they require ENA to warrant gas sold is "intrastate" gas.  For obvious reasons this is not possible.  Please give me a call should you wish to discuss this further.

  Regarding SJ,  the Master Gas agreement as drafted and sent to the customer included a Gty to ENA for 7mm.  As stated below, Darren has requested a Gty from SJ to ENA for 8mm that covers physical gas and financial trades.  Have they sent us a gty or are your drafting one?  In any case please let me know.  I need to revise my draft and secure a copy for use as an exhibit to my Master.

Thanks

This is a new worksheet for South Jersey. The threshold has been adjusted down to allow for financial trading under an ISDA(also working on that worksheet). Ann Koehler, in the financial legal group, was drafting language for amending the current incoming grty to include swap language. I am uncertain as to whether the amended grty can be applied to both contracts. If so, we need to have it increased to $8MM and indefinitely extended. Please coordinate with Anne.

Debra - any word from Stacy on this subject?
Also, we need to get set up/given approval  in the "ICE" (InterContinental
Exchange) on line system so we can trade with Enron.
Would you be able to assist us with this inquiry? Or refer me to someone who
can?

Good Morning,
    Enclosed is a draft of a GISB for Utility Resource Solutions, LP.  They have done some small physical volumes secured by a pre-pay, but are interested in establishing a more developed relationship.  As such, they want to enter into a GISB with Enron.  This is their copy forwarded through Jay Reitmeyer.  Please review and advise what needs to be done, if anything, to get this executed.

Subject:	Enron Energy Services Gas Contracts

Good morning Debra,

Could you help me on the following questions that we have:

1.	Could you tell me who the contract administrator or Paralegal would
be for Enron Energy Services.  Maybe it is you?
2.	If it is you, could send me electronically the Master Gas Agreement
for Enron Energy Services in word format?
3.	If you handle Enron Energy Services can we can do a gas long confirm
until we have the Master fully executed?
4.	Once we have come to a final agreement with Enron North America's
could we rubber stamp the agreement for Enron Energy Services?

Sorry to shoot so many questions at you so early in the morning but if you
could let me know, I sure would appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

Debra,

I forwarded down to you the subject several months ago. We had a conversation a few weeks ago and you advised me it had been forwarded to someone for review. I still have not seen the documents back and have been advised by OGT that we can not nominate gas on that agreement until we return it to them.

Would you be so kind to check on it.

Thanks.

Bryant

I have went ahead and completed the Western side of your GISB.  In addition, I have sent your special provisions page to our legal for review.  Once I receive the same back from them, I will be in touch with Debra for further negotiations.

If it wouldn't be much trouble, I would appreciate it if you would see that this GISB is forwarded on to her.

Thank you.

Debra,

I started to review the above-referenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on
April 5, 2001, and realized that we already have a GISB in place between
NSP-MN and Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  Is it necessary to prepare
another GISB with the Enron North America entity, or can there be an
assignment of the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Agmt.  Please advise.

In addition, I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning
the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service
Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power, which utilized the
Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement.  Our preference
would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with
each of these utilities.  Please advise if this is acceptable and, if so, I
will prepare GISB Agreements, along with our Special Provisions page, and
send them to you for review.

I look forward to your reply.

p.s.  I will be out of the office during the week of August 12th, but will

 As an update, there is only one issue remaining concerning the agreement, that being Force Majeure.  Also I am waiting on a revision to Dynegy's Guaranty for Nicor.   I have left a message for Mr. Hunt and await his call.  I think we are there just a few minor adjustments.

 I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sen=
tence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete th=
is as it does not allow for Force Majeure.

 FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Custome=
r may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed=
 Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours r=
equesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled du=
ring selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request =
must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the=
 last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.=
  A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible=
 Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fix=
ed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which=
 a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original =
Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to=
 the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's ac=
ceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmles=
s for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantit=
y of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quant=
ity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without =
limitation events of Force Majeure.

For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" =20

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,=
 in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo=
graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele=
vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t=
hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u=
nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average=
 of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin=
t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D=
ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d=
etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced=
ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo=
t Price can be determined.

Let  me know what you think.

Debra--

My only response to this contract is that Duke should only be given $1MM for their credit threshold (and not $10MM).  Again, the ISDA contract that we already have executed is eating up all of their line.  They should not complain about this, as the executed Master Physical with ECC gives them a $1MM threshold.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I remember going through this once before with them.  Just have them call me about their threshold if they're disputing it.

Thanks--Veronica

Debra,

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday regarding the GISB
contract.
I look forward to receipt of your suggested language for the netting and
dispute resolution provisions, and your decision on the acceptability of
our Sections 10.3, 10.4, and 15 (Confidentiality).

Please do not hesitate to call if we need to discuss this further.
Unless you instruct otherwise, we intend to sign the Base Contract
first, and then FedEx partially executed originals to you for signature.

Thanks,

November 1, 2001

Dear WENH Members:

Elections for the new Board of Directors for 2002 are coming up. This is a
reminder of what was announced to the membership at our luncheon on October
10th:

Please remember to e-mail Leesa Foster, President of WENH,  at lfoster@kmg.com by November 6, 2001
if you wish to be considered for either (1) serving on the Nominating
Committee (we have two member slots available from the general membership),
or (2) serving on the Board of Directors for 2002.  See further information
for both, including available Board positions below:


NOMINATING COMMITTEE:

If you wish to self-nominate to serve on the Nominating Committee for
purposes of establishing a slate of potential Board members for the upcoming
election, please e-mail Leesa Foster at lfoster@kmg.com by November 6, 2001.  The Nominating
Committee will consist of the Outgoing President, Immediate Past President,
one retiring Board member, and two members from the general membership who
are not seeking election to the Board and who possess objectivity and
knowledge of WENH's mission such that the most qualified candidate for each
Board position may be fairly chosen.


2002 BOARD OF DIRECTORS POSITIONS AVAILABLE:

For the upcoming 2002 Board elections, if you wish to be considered for a
Board position, please submit a written request by November to Leesa Foster either

 Dear Debra and Gerald,

Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could pick
you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in downtown(they
have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch, so if
your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

Best Regards,

Majed Nachawati

Subject:	Guaranty

There is a company that will need to provide us with a guaranty prior to allowing access to trade on EOL.  The guaranty will cover physical NG and physical Power.  Through working with the financial legal team, a format has been discussed that covers multiple products for physical and financial business across multiple Enron entities.  Ideally, this is probably the best format to have a counterparty use.  Pursuant to instructions, I am not sending out a format to this company without having a member of the legal team give me the ok.  I was hoping that we could all coordinate on the multi-product, multi-entity format and possibly use it on a going forward basis.  Thanks for your help and please let me know if there are any questions.

Debra,
Do you mind if we make the effective date December 1, 2001?  We've done quite a
few deals under this contract in October and I don't want to have to process new
confirms for this past business.  Additionally, by the time we route the
amendment through our organization, get it signed and back to you, and then
Enron does the same thing, we could be looking at the same problem in November.
Using a 12/1/01 effective date should allow sufficient time for execution by
both sides and getting our systems updated.
Thanks,
Jim

Hi Debra,

I am the new law clerk taking over for Majed.  I hope that you had nice vacation.  I am working on some of the GISBs that Majed had been assigned before he left.  However, I have not been able to get very far due to the fact that I don't have all of the necessary information.  I hope that if you have a spare moment today, you can give me a little guidance as to what I should be doing.  I know the first day back is always very busy, so just let me know.

Importance:	High

Cheryl,

I have reviewed the current contracts and deals in place with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. (CP ID 55358) and found that we have deals extending through 08/31/01.  However, the only current deals are with ICC Energy Corporation (an alternate payee under our contract with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. ).  There are NO current deals with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. at this time.

We currently have two master contracts in place as well as two spot GTCs.  I imagine that we will need to terminate all these agreements, but Legal is unaware of any changes with this counterparty.  Darren, can you please provide Stacy Dickson with the name of your contact at Constellation?  

We also do not have ANY master agreements in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc. - all business (telephonic and EOL) is being covered under GTCs.  Stacy or Debra, do we have any negotiations in place for a master under this name?  Darren, can you work with Stacy on this?

Please let me know if we need to terminate or trade suspend the Constellation Energy Source, Inc. agreements.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?  

Thanks,

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

Judy,

attached is the rider that Enron North America and I agreed to.  Please review and determine if this would be acceptable to ENA Upstream.  The changes are:

1.  Section 6 in the rider is deleted in entirety and Section 6 of the GISB stands.

2.  A new Section 7.5 has been added.

3.  Lastly, the last 2 sentences of Article 13.9 are additions.

All options selected on the cover of the GISB are acceptable to Sequent

 Kathy,

Attached for your review and signature, is an Amendment to the current Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.  The Amendment restates Section 2.4 and in so doing ENA becomes the confirming party for all transactions. 

Please print and execute two originals and forward same to my attention.  Upon final execution, I will forward an original for your records. Please do not hesitate to give me a call should you have any questions regarding the enclosed.

Debra:

I have briefly discussed some of the issues concerning the changes we feel
are appropriate with your diversity program: Ms. Hunter, Mr. Eakins, Ms.
Medcalf.  They were interested about in my reasoning behind the suggested
changes.  I realize their could or will be different verbiage concerning my
change's; however, the intent is firm because of the standard GISB payment
dates previously agreed upon as well as anticipated payment date for other
Resale Customers.

I am assuming there is little room for negotiation as the agreement format
requirement of the Buyer?

Please advise me of your comments concerning the changes so as we can move
forward. I have been asked to keep the Diversity people informed of my
progress so I am copying Ms. Hunter on this E-Mail.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

Debra,
Here are the negotiated terms for Enfolio. Please note the Credit Matrix for the thresholds and the changes in MAC provisions. I have removed the Financial Covenant clause and have changed the rating event from BBB+ to BBB-. 
If there are any questions, please call. In addition, this should be the final (execution copy) of the contract, so please bring the document for Credit's initials prior to sending.

 Dear Debra,

I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for lunch. I
feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was interviewing
for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town on Thursday
of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me know. I want
you to fill me in on how you have been.

Your law clerk,

Majed Nachawati

 Further to our conversation, with regards to the contracts, ENA prefers  two separate agreements one for each enitity. For accounting and legal reasons two agreements are necessary.  I will prepare a draft   for Kentucky Utilities Company if you wish to move forward.  Let me have your thoughts regarding this issue.

Robin,
 Here is the redline version including FM revisions.  We cannot agree to the sentence in section 14.4 beginning "In addition....." as we will not pay demand charges. 
Also with regard to days to cure default, sections 9.4 /  10.3 as discussed.  We would agree to 4 days? Please review the attached and let me have your thoughts.

 I  know nothing about this agreement, and Jeff nor Gerald are currently working with this cp.  Global Contracts does not indicate a Master in place.  However, Stacy Dickson is out of the office today, she could be working with this cp.

 given the current climate, do you still want to to exclude language in the Threshold Article giving either party the right to request an LC at any time?  as written, the LC can be requested  1x a month.

Did you ever receive a signed copy back from Dick Forrest from last November?
If so, no need to send out a new contract.  Just send a copy to Dick Forrest.
This came about when Dick Forrest called me last week stating that he could not find a copy of our contract, that's why I had Terry request another copy be sent.

That is good news.  Now we have the GISB to finish off.

As for your question, I have been hiking, but not as much as I would like.
Actually, I'm hoping to pick up a weekend of intense instruction in
technical rock climbing near Estes Park in the near future.  The brother of
a friend is a serious climber and instructor who gives private lessons to
fund his ever-expanding collection of climbing toys.

Alisha Mahabir and I are currently negotiating a new GISB with MGI with some difficulty. Also concerning PMI Trading, at present I show only swap agreements with this company.  Marie Heard or Susan Bailey can assist you with swap agreements.  Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this further. I have asked Alisha to give you a call regarding MGI.

Debra,

Per our meeting this morning, I got a contact for the IGI Resources, Inc. GISB amendment:

Lisa Anderson
e-mail address: anderlm1@bp.com
Phone #:  (208) 395-0511

Lisa says she cannot find the proposed GISB contract we sent her and wants us to send her another one. 

Our trader for BTA Oil Producers is Randy Gay.  He is the one who requested an Enfolio Master Spot Purchase Sale Contract.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Ann

 Stacey please place contract # 96000781 on no trade status (Interruptible Gas Purchase Agreement dated February 1, 1994).  As you may recall we will be assigning  the remaining  transaction (dated 11/30/00 Trans. No. QA0516.1 / 487737) to ENA Upstream.  I plan on putting an new agreement in place to replace the above.  

 Thanks !!!

Debra,

Kim Clausen has agreed, on behalf of the above referenced company, to have the GISB contract amended to designate ENA as confirming party.  Details are as follows:

Contract #: 96020382
E-mail:KClausen@mitchellgs.com
Phone: (713) 377-7090
Fax: (713) 377-6728

Please, if possible, give this amendment priority.  It is one of the "major problem counterparties" we discussed in the meeting.

Let me know if there is any way I can assist.

Thanks,

Debra,

Per our meeting this morning, I got a contact for the IGI Resources, Inc. GISB amendment:

Lisa Anderson
e-mail address: anderlm1@bp.com
Phone #:  (208) 395-0511

Lisa says she cannot find the proposed GISB contract we sent her and wants us to send her another one. 

Our trader for BTA Oil Producers is Randy Gay.  He is the one who requested an Enfolio Master Spot Purchase Sale Contract.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Ann

Debra,

All of the thresholds and Mac's on the contract look good.  However, please confirm in which name the contract will be executed as, please.  I think that the contract should be executed with Atmos Energy Corporation.  In which case all of the references to Customer in the contract will have to be changed (as they all currently refer to Greeley Gas Company, a div....).  The problem is that we do term deals with Atmos as well (most of them) and if it is a division of the contract should be with Atmos and not Greeley Gas, a div.

Thanks and sorry about the delay,

Veronica

 Please look at the attached redline from Greeley regarding the credit sections.  As you may recall a previous discussion regarding the exact name for the contract, the contract will be in the name of Atoms Energy Corp.  Please let me know asap.  Thanks

On Saturday, Sept. 22, 2001 at approximately 1:47 a.m., I was awaken by the=
 sounds of a car crash.  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom w=
indow at Hwy 36, I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell asleep.  At ap=
proximately 2:45 a.m., I was awaken by the sounds of a man outside my bedro=
om window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up pretty bad.  As I jump=
ed out of bed and looked out my bathroom window, I saw a police officer out=
side with a flash light.  I woke Keith up to tell him the police were in ou=
r yard.  Keith dressed and went out the front door.  The officer told Keith=
 to get back inside because an armed suspect was running around our home.  =
Keith came back inside and told me what was going on.  After checking on An=
drew, we went into Chasity's vacant bedroom and looked out the window into =
the backyard.  Men with flash lights, police cars with spot lights were all=
 over our yard.  Finally, the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree clo=
ses to our house.  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to =
surrender.  Since the suspect would not cooperate, an officer shouted sever=
al times that he was going to "shoot".  This was not something I wanted to =
witness, so I quit looking out the window.  Keith told me that he surrender=
ed and that they had him in custody.  An officer starting knocking on our f=
ront door.  As I opened the door, I informed the officer that my husband wo=
uld be right there.  Keith went outside to talk to the officer.  I looked o=
ut my living room window and saw my driveway full of police cars followed b=
y an ambulance.  Hwy 36 and Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their=
 spot lights pointed toward our house.  Keith came inside and informed me t=
hat Buccee's in Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted=
, the ambulance was for her and the suspect didn't have a gun, but was carr=
ying a knife.  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that the truck=
 they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side of our barn=
.  The police were outside video taping our front yard, treating it as a cr=
ime scene.  Once the police took off with the suspect and the ambulance tra=
nsported the victim, Keith talked me into going outside and looking at the =
crash.  By this time, a wrecker was at the scene.  We watched the wrecker d=
river pull the truck back onto all four tires and haul it away.
=20
On Sunday morning at approximately 2:30 a.m., I woke up and started listeni=
ng for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier.  Once I rea=
lized that my home was safe, I went back to sleep. =20
=20
With a troubled mind, I realized that I did not know how to deal with "viol=
ence". I called my brother-in-law, Rev. Dale Frankum, for answers.  Dale su=
ggested I read the book of Psalm.  Gladys suggested particularly Chapter 91=
.  After reading Psalm 91:4 "He will cover you with his feathers, and under=
 his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and r=
ampart", I found peace of mind.  I now know that He put me back to bed, ins=
tead of me searching for an answer to the crash that woke me up which put a=
 violent man outside my home.  And He kept my son in a deep sleep so that A=
ndrew would not witness the horror that was going on right outside his bedr=
oom window.  At this time, all Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in =
our front yard, I would like to spare him from the rest of the story.
=20
As our country heals from the events of Sept. 11, 2001 and as we continue t=
o fear more terrorist attacks, I suggest you read the book of Psalm to find=
 peace of mind because He is our refuge.
=20
My God Bless you, your family and America.

  Sarai,  at the risk of my head, I will agree to "Seller" as confirming party.  So pending netting language we are good to go.

Debra,
As discussed on 9/19, the e-mail below and attached documents reflect the
final status of the GISB/netting.  I'd like to get this wrapped up and
signed within the next 2 weeks, if humanly possible.  Let me know where we
stand.

Debra,
Now that we have the Master Firm Agreement nearly signed off on, I'd like
to get the GISB and netting agreements in place as well.  Attached below
are the GISB cover page and Special Provisions that my records reflect we
last agreed to.  I'd like to see Enron's new netting agreement because the
netting agreement previously sent to MW is a year old.  If you have no
changes to the GISB cover page and SP, we should nearly be caught up.  I
look forward to receiving the netting agreement from you.  Thanks.

Good morning,

My name is Barbara Hammack and I am a new contract analyst at Reliant
Energy, I am assuming the responsibilities of the desk that is handling the
negotiations of the GISB with ENA Upstream.  From what I can gather in the
pending file left at this desk, it does not appear that you were sent
Reliant's Special Provisions to the GISB.  I have attached these Special
Provisions, as well as, the comments our legal group has made regarding
ENA's Special Provisions.

If you have any questions or require further information, please feel free
to call or email.
