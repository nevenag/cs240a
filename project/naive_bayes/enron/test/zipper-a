READING fwd ----------------------  Forwarded Message  ---------------------Who did it     Foreign Report presents an alternative view Israels military intelligence service Aman suspects that Iraq is the state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington Directing the mission Aman officers believe were two of the worlds foremost terrorist masterminds the Lebanese Imad Mughniyeh head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah and the Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden The two men have not been seen for some time Mughniyeh is probably the worlds most wanted outlaw Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable Zawahiri is thought to be based in Egypt He could be Bin Ladens chief representative outside Afghanistan The Iraqis who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty work were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda The Israeli sources claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling between Baghdad and Afghanistan meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri According to the sources one of the Iraqi intelligence officers Salah Suleiman was captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad Mughniyeh Weve only got scraps of information not the full picture admits one intelligence source but it was good enough for us to send a warning six weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was expected One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany We believe that the operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi Intelligence Service SSO Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before On April 12th 1997 he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest goal of any terrorist organisation until last week blowing up an Israeli El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv A man carrying a forged British passport with the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel when it accidentally went off Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but Lebanese and that his operation was supposed to be a special gift to Israel from Imad Mughniyeh A psychopath Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh says an Israeli who knows Mughniyeh  The guy is a genius someone who refined the art of terrorism to its utmost level We studied him and reached the conclusion that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological reasons which we have given up trying to understand The killing of his two brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state behind the two terror masterminds In recent months there was a change and Iraq decided to get into the terror business On July 7th they tried for the first time to send a suicide bomber trained in Baghdad to blow up Tel Aviv airport Foreign Report No 2651 Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of this unprecedented terror operation However they believe the chief of the Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein the dictators son and his organisation is the most likely to have been involved Mughniyeh 48 is a sick man says an intelligence officer who was in charge of his file He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the most dangerous active terrorist today He is wanted by several governments and the Americans have put a 2m reward on his head Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made Mughniyeh the CIAs most wanted terrorist Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the head of the CIA station in Beirut William Buckley The kidnapping triggered what later became known as Irangate when the Americans tried to exchange Buckley and others with arms for Iran However the attempt ended in a fiasco By one unconfirmed account Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley with his own hands A year later in a combined CIAMossad operation a powerful car bomb went off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullahs spiritual leader Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah Seventy-five people were killed One of them was his brother Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad Mughniyeh hid in Iran In February 1992 Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the then head of Hizbullah Sheikh Abas Musawi in South Lebanon Musawi his wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later According to press reports Mughniyeh was called back into action and in a well-planned and devastating attack his people blew up the Israeli embassy in Argentina The building was demolished and 92 were killed Only last year after a long investigation did Argentina issue a warrant for Mughniyehs arrest The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994 when a car bomb went off in a southern Shiite suburb of Beirut Four people were killed One of them was called Mughniyeh but to the deep disappointment of those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one Mughniyehs life was saved but his other brother Fuad was killed Mughniyeh waited for his opportunity for revenge Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyehs signature on the wreckage in New York and Washington How to counter this kind of terrorism To fight these bastards you dont need a military attack said an experienced Israeli commando officer You only need to adopt Israels assassination policy Some interesting facts and info Subject Whats the Plan -- Patterns of Global Terrorism 2000 Hello friends For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with all my heart family and friends are safe  The victims will not be forgotten I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of what is to come  Or perhaps Im ranting you decide My first reactions like many others were decimation selected occupation no more standing military slowly over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations into the fold of economic prosperity  This has worked before but will it now  On terrorism and intelligence I think terrorism is not to be treated as criminal law we cannot follow the diplomatic code when dealing with terrorist organizations ie our intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these people or have moles on the payroll After a few days of kill em all mentality I decided to begin my education in this matter  I would like to share with you my first research and some impressions I do feel more informed  My resolve is no different but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into something far more calculated Domestic and international terrorism has been a horrible problem for as long as most nations can remember  There is on average more than one terrorist event a day in the world  In the late 1980s it was as high as 2 events a day This is terrorism  From Colin Powell himself  I found myself numb before I event got through the first months of 2000 httpwwwusisusembseterrorrpt2000indexhtml httpwwwusisusembseterrorrpt2000indexhtml List of major terrorist organizations - they will all need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first targets httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgptgpndxhtm2000 httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgptgpndxhtm2000 Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella organization for a worldwide network that includes many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad some members of al-Gamaat al-Islamiyya the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the Harakat ul-Mujahidin Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin Laden financially his network is like a holding company  Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the four organizations listed below  Each of the other organizations in turn exerts influence over other terrorist groups  Most of these are fundamental Islamic extremist organizations  A fear is that a general cohesive theme is to overthrow the middle-eastern governments establish fundamentalist Islamic states which would persecute other religious observers within their borders wage war on western influence internally  and potentially engage in military actions against the United States and other western nations httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpqaidahtm httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpqaidahtm These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin Laden in 1998 calling for the death of Americans al-Jihad Egyptian Islamic JihadIslamic JihadJihad Group httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpjihadhtm httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpjihadhtm Al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya Islamic Group  killed Sedat has been terrorizing Egyptian government officials for years httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpalgamahtm httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpalgamahtm Harakat ul-Mujahidin HUM Sunni Muslim terrorists linked to Taliban and bin Laden located in Pakistan and the Kashmir province in India maintain organized terrorism against India and Hindu culture in the region httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgphuahtm httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgphuahtm Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan IMU Focused primarily on terrozing its bordering nations locally focused with aspirations for eliminating western influence unchecked this organization will grow into a world terror problem httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpimuhtm httpwebnpsnavymillibrarytgpimuhtm Travel Warnings from the Department of State I like these links for the one-liner view of the security conditions in these nations There is significant conflict and terrorism along the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and Kyrgyz-Tajik borders httptravelstategovafghanistanhtml httptravelstategovafghanistanhtml httptravelstategovtajikistanhtml httptravelstategovtajikistanhtml httptravelstategovuzbekistanhtml httptravelstategovuzbekistanhtml httptravelstategovturkmenistanhtml httptravelstategovturkmenistanhtml httptravelstategovkyrgyzhtml httptravelstategovkyrgyzhtml Geography - very good idea to look at maps of the region httpwwwrandmcnallycom httpwwwrandmcnallycom I found the geography interesting to study in detail Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access  The ocean-to-land access is through Pakistans Arabian Sea coast then head North 800 miles to Peshawar and then into Kabul the mountainous route the British used in 1946  The Pakistan army is 50 Taliban sympathetic Already 42 political parties have issued statements of opposition to their own government for offering to help America  They will descend into civil war most surely  The HUM will likely be a significant part of that problem  It will do us no good to partner with a cooperative government and an uncooperative military Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by renegades within their own army Things we should know In Pakistan many Afghan refugees were initially trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence ISI in the 1980s to fight the Soviets  They were called the Mujahideen  Many were children living in refugee camps when recruited having known nothing else in this world  Left to their own devices for 10 years these camps and training centers have given root to terrorist organizations HUM and violently anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements the Taliban  The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan in 1996 overthrowing the then Shiite-Communist regime killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul for several days  The Taliban are Sunni Muslim fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat they terrorize other Muslim communities the Hazaras and Hindu Kush people within their borders    The Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan Hindus to wear identifications tags  Sound familiar The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida bin Ladens organization   bin Laden also influences the fundamentalist IMU in Uzbekistan  The IMU is another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group - they are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan Kyrgyzistan and Tajikistan north of Afghanistan The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the Pushtun region  Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan There have been movements to create a separate Pushtunistan  This map indicates the ethnic breakdown in the region httpwwwlibutexasedumapsmiddleeastandasiapakistanethnic80jpg httpwwwlibutexasedumapsmiddleeastandasiapakistanethnic80jpg And the HUM focuses their attacks on India The Shiite Muslims many other Sunni Muslims and in general the world muslim community do not agree with the Talibans interpretation of Islamic law  The Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world because of their extreme harshness and treatment of women total eliminations of all modern culture and being the worlds largest heroin production  The elimination of western influence is not considered a problem within some other fundamentalist groups Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to its West  Iran is an Shia or Shiite Muslim nation Because Iran is predominantly Shia they are unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated Afghanistan  Iran backs the ousted government and is angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of thousands of Shia Muslims including Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan  Iran also has border disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a devastating 8 year war  Afghanistan and Iraq are both 25 million people Iran is closer to 65 million An exchange from 1998 regarding Iran and Afghanistan httpwwwfasorgmandod-101opswar199809980910-afghan2htm httpwwwfasorgmandod-101opswar199809980910-afghan2htm Also during the war with Soviet over 10 MILLION land mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left behind httpwwwafghan-networknetLandmines httpwwwafghan-networknetLandmines The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern Military Alliance  These people are also Sunni Muslim and ethnically are the Tajiks  Their leader Massoud was killed last week assassinated by men posing as the press  The sliver of Afghanistan they still control is the finger squeezed between northern Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban without initiating conflict with Tajikistan  The NMA is a political authority that may be put in place They have offered 15000 soldiers and 15000 more on reserve  Their leader was killed last week most likely in some coordinated effort - along with the new requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need to put monies in to the Afghan bank  Many acts were clearly coordinated in this event I have also been seeking out information on the Taliban in particular  These link contain some very powerful information  Quite frankly it is shameful

September 6 2001 Arab Fighters Provide Support for Taliban httpwwwfeministorgnewsnewsbyteuswirestoryaspid5785 httpwwwfeministorgnewsnewsbyteuswirestoryaspid5785 Try to digest this information - it is very important that initiate an informed dialogue  But the Taliban must go This section is organized geographically based on the waterways The nations in question will need to eradicate expel extremists from within their own borders  This means partnering with a United States led coalition and contributing emphatically Look at the Mediterranean coast The South - Morocco Algeria Libya and Egypt are all plagued by terrorism The East - Israel Lebanon Syria  all plagued by terrorist groups  There is a dreadful rooting of terrorist organization  Beirut was once a beautiful city I am told For 20 years it has replaced Warsaw as the pop-culture reference to a war torn city Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS Look at the Red Sea EgyptSudan and Saudi Arabia  The Sudan is terribly infiltrated this may be the terrorist plan hatching ground and safe haven  And while the Saudis are economically partnered with the western world many extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these organizations  Sudan is also suspected of being a meeting ground for the terrorist network Look at the Gulf of Aden - entrance to the Red Sea Yemen - has allowed bin Laden to broadcast site of the USS Cole bombing  After the attack the perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - both acknowledge the Taliban government  They have provided radical nationals to the Afghans throughout the years many support the Taliban some trained with bin Laden  We hope these governments have a change of heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban Iran Persia until 1935 has coastal territory along the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north  We have had problems with Iran in the past in the current situation they may be helpful maybe not  There is information pointing to an Islamic conference in Tehran which is another possible hatching ground for these operations  Iran still may be a very serious issue in the future  It is a religious government -something we all implicitly abhor in this nation They exiled the Shah and began systematically eliminating western influence from their society after the event in 1979 Iraq - Part of the Ottoman empire through 1932 Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own nationals the Kurds in the North near the Turkish border  As we know he has invaded Kuwait  An 8 year war with Iran over borders was going on at the same time the soviets were in Afghanistan  This is a military regime  Though the economic sanctions we have used for the last 10 years have kept Iraq down as military force they have created a new generation of hatred East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea part of the Indian Ocean the Arabian basin is separated from the Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is nothing to prevent sea travel Pakistan - a country on the verge of civil war  A military regime Probably half of the people in the army are Taliban sympathizers  Pakistan may be in civil war shortly India - the largest democracy in the world  Still disassembling the 3500 yr old Caste System  The British occupation left India with an intact system of representative government  They are plagued by internal strife from the Sikh who are separatists Their brand of terrorism has been significantly reduced in the past 8 years  They are also plagued by the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement - very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden as described earlier China actually shares a thin strip of border with Afghanistan near Tajikistan  Pakistan also borders on China  Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this geographically from the 1 billion people of China Having China on board is critical I would like the US to investigate TSI Telephone Services International a New Jersey Corporation and Unocal a California Oil Company  Both of these companies have had business dealings with the Taliban government  I believe that corporate greed with total disregard for the human condition in any country is unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with accordingly  And I think the investment community needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations who dabble in business with terror linked organizations  The investment community was hit particularly hard i hope going forward there will be a clear message to stop support for companies who may potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans We may need to legally restrict what our corporations can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals with based on the opportunity cost of potential terrorist activity  By all means no corporation should have had any business dealings with the Taliban perhaps this should be enforced by law Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND I firmly believe that the deadened state of intellectual discussion concerning these issues in America is part of the problem We have been funneling our best minds into Technology Banking Law and Medicine for a very long time  The general lack of information and interest in world political and human conditions and the evolution of human governments is dangerous  The average American simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to express to our government on what we can do to ensure the survival of our way of life and the spread of goodwill Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful military strike will initiate this new campaign  I think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we really are about to embark on  Our army may well include the corporate army and the casualties will be civilian  We need to get every American to study this condition its roots causes directions and what we can do to end it  Americans need to start an intelligent dialogue around the country publicly so that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of the world that we are educated and serious about achieving a solution  Our military domination is already known throughout the world Perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the middle-class communities in these nations assuming they are moderate tolerant and peace-loving they need something to lose and conversely something to protect  To get there we will need to eradicate any fundamentalist governments like the Taliban under no circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the terrorist organizations down within their borders  We need to seize assets disable communications engage in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign Lets focus our efforts on thinking and providing our leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom an opinion from within  While I trust the powers that be to handle these affairs  I never believed any day in my life that we were so vulnerable Know the enemy The threat of bio-chemical weapons - a simple overview of what the most likely agents are httpabcnewsgocomsectionsscienceDailyNewsdeadlygas0210html httpabcnewsgocomsectionsscienceDailyNewsdeadlygas0210html There is one company in America that is contracted by the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine the BioPort Corporation formerly known as the Michigan Biologic Products Institute MBPI  I hope the defense around that company is solid Hopefully this will generate some interest in developing a public discussion regarding strategies for the eradication of terrorism and governments that support them actively tacitly or otherwise  bin Laden  Imad Mughniyeh head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah and the Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible and the Taliban should go first then perhaps the other organizations mentioned above  Then what Hussein Qaddafi  Will Egypt be on board when the Al Jihad unleash terror in Egypt  Do these nations host silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within their borders completely bending to the will of terrorists for fear of their people being injured  Is that support or a successful campaign of terror Where do we draw the line  I suppose where you stand after Tuesday is a good start  Whos next  How do we prioritize Will they are be lined
