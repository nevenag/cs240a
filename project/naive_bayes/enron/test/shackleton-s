We are opening up an account with Fimat Canada in the name of Enron North America.  Legal is currently working on getting the execution and clearing account opened.  
This was part of the initiative last Thursday to move futures accounts to beneficial Futures clearers.

In the meantime,  Fimat Canada is requesting that we get an Give-up agreement in place with clearing going to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
We are okay with this. 

They would like to get the give up signed today.  They say it is the standard format.
Jean-Pierre at Fimat is the contact for any questions.

Please call me if I can be of assistance.

Thanks, Sheila

Sheila,

We have not got yet the authorization from the Fimat Group risk department
to open a clearing account for Enron at Fimat Derivatives Canada.  I will
send you the required schedules once I get this authorization.

In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

(See attached file: giveup_ENRONNESBITT.doc)

Please have this agreement signed in three copies and send them to my
attention at 1501, McGill College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3M8.

Also, please fax me a copy this afternoon ASAP at 514-841-6217.

Subject:	Payment Language on Financial Power Confirms


Sara,

It has been brought to my attention that the payment language we are using for financial power trades that are less than one month in duration does not mention that payment is due 5 business days after the floating price is determinable.  It basically says 5 business days after the last day of the month.

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period of one month or longer).

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Period (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period less than one month).


Can you draft payment language for trades less than one month that states payment is due five business days after the floating price is determinable?

Call me if you would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Melissa

I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Sara,

Attached is the initial draft of the term sheet prepared by Bear Stearns for use in connection with Project Bruin. I hope that the e-mails I am forwarding to you are sufficient to give you an idea of the nature and intended accomplishments of the exercise.

Now that I am re-reading the message from Tom Blair of Bear Stearns, I see that he intended to follow up with additional detailed term sheets. I will ask whether those have been provided to us and forward them to you in the event we have them.

Please find following an indicative term-sheet for your/team's review.
While there are three simultaneous trades occuring at the same time, Davis
wanted one term-sheet to use for your internal conversations for simlplicity
sake.  We will have additional term-sheets available for all three
components of the trade tomorrow.  I will make sure you have a summary pitch
book available to discuss the merits/risks of the trade by Friday.  

Speak with you in the am.

Best.

The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.  Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".  I didn't find it necessary to impede Enron Corp.'s signature; just let Phil know for the next deal.  Thanks.  Sara

Tim - we are comfortable with the changes to the definition of "material"
given that Lehman is not entering the market as a result of "rolling" the
transaction.  Should we amend the transaction in or enter in any future
transaction where we enter the market on behalf of ENE, we would require the
"standard" definition of "material.

You can take the Metal Management issue.  

Why don't we fill out a wire request for the 66,307.44?  Bryan can sign and then fax to me for gary and my signature.  Lets try and see what happens. What do you think?

I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

Please advise if you are still the lawyer who reviews RMT masters, when requested for preparation.

If so, Legal has been requested to prepare an ISDA between RMT and Enron Japan Corp., which shall support their FX transactions.

Let me know, so I can pass this draft on to you for review.

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin

Spoke with Phil Levy regarding several issues.  He is immediately emailing FX amendment for the existing master and will simultaneously review the existing ISDA for FX coverage.  The executed amendment will resolve the margining issues ASAP.  ENA will produce a draft Schedule/CSA to begin negotiations for an upgraded master which will include multibranch parties.

Carol:

As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins.
To date, we have only focused on:

	ENA 
	EPMI
	ENE
	ENA Upstream Company LLC
`	EPMI

We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).

Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). 

Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".

The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.

You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.

Spoke with Dale Ginter (bankruptcy lawyer).  Problem is that Merced wants to cut a deal and terminate if they can pay over 18 months.  I explained that we would terminate if he didn't.  I agreed to not act today and advise him of our decision.  

Louis, we should talk about this one.

Would you be available sometime on Tuesday, March 18 to conduct (again) your bankruptcy discussion for a smaller focused paper and pulp commercial group?  I'd like to schedule as soon as possible.  We can meet at your convenience.  Please respond.

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NO=
T flow around the structure.  If you read the confirms, you will see that E=
nron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically a=
t the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated).  Th=
us, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for t=
hat margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Ou=
r swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of=
 the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap=
 could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but i=
n essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margi=
n MSCG.  Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not re=
ceive any.  If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, y=
ou wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the=
 money they prepay you as collateral.  Hope it is clear - I am out of the o=
ffice tomorrow, but I will be back on Monday.

In case we don't hook up, the update on TXU is as follows:

As you know, TXU would like to settle and pay what they owe us.  

I met with Jeff Shorter, my counterparty at TXU last week and presented him with our list of contracts and termination dates.  They sent us preliminary numbers, which appear to be pretty close to what we're showing.  Ball is currently in their court - they are to come back to us with their values as of the termination dates we specified, and back-up for amounts that are essentially their estimates of LDs.  We have questions on their numbers for EPMI and EES, but these only represent around $2mm.  The bulk of the value is in the financial gas position.  The ISDA has not been formally terminated, and we need to agree on a date to do this.  Next step is for them to come with their version of settlement amounts for each contract - we will then provide them with ours, then go to reconciliation process.  

 	 

The first file is Harlan's list of contracts and termination dates.  The second is TXU's estimates of settlement amounts.  We discussed both in our meeting and TXU is to come back with back up for their numbers so we can agree on dates and reconcile.  I have call into Jeff Shorter to follow up - they should be getting back to us shortly.  Assuming they agree with our termination dates, and come back with their back up info, the next step will be for us to meet and reconcile numbers.  This should take place in the next week or so.  If you have any questions please call me.  If I'm not at my desk my cell is 713 826-1439.  Home number is 713 781-2966.

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Importance:	High

Pursuant to the below email and our discussions today, pls find attached the list forward by Todd Delahoussaye, Financial Deal Compliance, which includes all the deals entered into with Morgan Stanley Capital Group. The deal no is QH4715. 

I am also forwarding you the confirms which we have executed with CSFB and MS, last year, which I had earlier forwarded to Bob last week. 

The contact person at CSFB is James Moran. His email address is james.moran@csfb.com

We still have to hear from CSFB whether they can provide a tax rep on their Cayman Islands entity. As per my understanding, that is the only relevant credit issue for this transaction. 

Looking forward to hearing from you on the confirms necessary for the roll-over. Could you give me a call sometime later today, when you have finished going through them. 

Thanks & Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

Rob/ Sara, 

As indicated in the other email of today, Todd has sent me a separate list which Morgan Stanley sent to Enron. I have gone through the list and this particular deal is indeed there. The confirms for this particular deal were sent by me sometime last week (both the CSFB and the MS confirms). Will call today to discuss further. 

Thanks

 Todd,

The Deal number for the below deal is QH4715.  Can you tell me if it is included in the list Morgan sent back to you?


Raj,
Morgan does not actually sign and return documents per the Master Agreement.  They send a reply type of message which states that they agree to a certain deal number or numbers.  Todd will let us know if this particular deal has been agreed to in this manner.
FYI, today is my last day in this group.  Going forward you can contact Diane Anderson for anything related to Confirmations.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Larry, 

You may have received a voicemail regarding the above. I am working with Treasa Kirby here in Global Finance and was wondering whether you have signed copies of the Morgan Stanley confirm for the above $150m oil prepay executed in Dec 2000/Jan 2001. We need to roll-over the oil prepay and need to discuss with the lawyers to understand whether any changes need to be made to the confirms. If you do have signed copies, kindly send both of us a copy of the same asap. 

Thanks & Regards

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Kevin

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Importance:	High

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Pamela:

On May 22, 2001, I sent an email to you regarding the aforementioned account assignment.  I also copied Nikki Kroll on that email.  ENA and ECI are anxious to have this assignment executed but we have not had any response.  I am reattaching a copy of the assignment for your convenience.  I will need your assistance in identifying the ECI account with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS").  Stephanie Panus sent Nikki Kroll the ECI account documentation via overnight delivery on May 18, 2001.

Please direct your attention to the following:

(1)  Please execute and return to ECI an original Corporate Account Agreement with GS.  Also, please provide ECI with the account number.

(2)  Please review the attached Assignment and Assumption Agreement and advise if we can execute and forward to GS for execution.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Maggie:

I do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  

(1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?

(2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)

(3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.

(4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?

(5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?

(6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:

"Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."

This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?

(6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."

(7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?

(8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?

In a letter dtd 3/13/02 Ormet said they wired to ENA $14,645.03 (plus interest) to cure a contract default.  I've been watching the cash inflow spreadsheet that gets published daily but haven't seen these funds on that report.  

Can you let me know whether you see any such payment from Ormet?

Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?

Sara,

Further to my voicemail message of this afternoon, attached is the "merger
letter".  As it happens, both Chase and Morgan had ISDA agreements in
place.  The letter selects the Chase agreement (which, as you know, we
amended earlier this week), as the preferred agreement, and terminates the
Morgan agreement.

Please review and call me (212-270-2673) if you have any questions.  If the
letter is acceptable, please call me and I'll arrange for execution copies
to be sent to your attention.

Thankyou again for you help.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.

Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.  Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

London:  Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.

Jay:  Please let legal know if this arrangement requires a master netting agreement.

Thanks.   Sara

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your

Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Lisa:

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

      Dear Sara & Cheryl,

      I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
      them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

      There had been some question as to which Enron entity
      was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
      information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
      office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
      & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
      International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

      Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
      confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
      whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
      also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
      done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
      get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

I received a message from the lawyer for Cinergy Energy Services requesting that the ENA ISDA be with CG&E.  This will solve our allocation issues (as the utility will hedge for its own account).  Please send a new credit worksheet.  Thanks.  SS

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

I have put together files for each of these that include copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence that has been sent.    Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the invoices and that the certificate be on "letterhead" there don't appear to be any other special requirements.

The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?

PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.

Hey,

We have decided that it would be best to set up an account at CSFB.  I think you guys are already working on everything else, but we will need to additionally complete the customer account agreement and W-9.  Once everything is complete, can you please send me copies for our records.  

Also, we are still pending an okay from Donna Lowry.

Thanks!

Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit
Department and Bill Bradford of your Credit Department yesterday,
attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy
Price Swap Agreement.  The purpose of this Fourth Amendment is to amend
the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.
Bradford has agreed to these terms.   Our Credit Department is expecting
that we bring this document to a closure quickly.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

My comments to the Customer Agreement which you delivered yesterday:

Please confirm the Enron party signing this agreement.  If it is ENA, then need to add 

(1)  ENA's standard limitation of liability clause
(2)  Par. 18 - exception for CSFB to attempt to communicate to ENA through reasonably available alternative means in the event of communication failure

I'll be brief.  We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).  David Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.  The ENA trader is Bill Berkeland and Bill suggested that Fred handle this customer (since it's Fred's customer).  Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the "ENA averages two quotes" scenario.  Fred should try to negotiate this one.  I left Fred a voice mail and Bill will contact Fred in the a.m.  Kim is aware of this situation.

Sara, try the instructions below in Lotusnotes.  The name of the database is New Power Contracts.  If you can't open it, you will need to go through eRequest to get access.

How to open the database in Notes:
Go to File...Database...Open
Server = ECTHOU_LN1
FileName = North_America\Swap.nsf
Click [Open]

I may have mentioned this a long time ago and then forgotten about it but I'd like to coordinate with the group that administers eRequest so that this becomes a requestable app on eRequest. Someone would then be able to make a request for access to the db and you'd have to approve it. The eRequest group would then be responsible for giving them access. That way, you don't have to wait on me.

Subject:	Employees who missed their 401-K contribution on the January 15, 2002 paycheck


It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

Mark:  Please read the attached message.

(1)  Are there any issues with following the "custom" in countries not requiring an executed "executing brokerage agreement"?  Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?

(2)  I anticipate that I will really need help on the brokerage agreement side.  I cannot keep up now on a "timely" basis.

Gary's world occupies about 50% of my time.
Enron Corp. occupies about 25% of my time.

Thanks.  Sara

Subject:	Metzler Capital Markets - Executing broker agreement

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:

Goldman Sachs & Co.

Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.

I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.

We can discuss further at 2:30.

Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill:

I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

For example:

USAIR #586 departs Houston at 7:50 am and arrives in Charlotte at 11:10 am
[USAIR#1620 departs Houston at 6:30 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 9:46 pm]
USAIR #897 departs Charlotte at 5:10 pm and arrives in Houston at 6:59 pm

I am certainly open to other options.  Please advise if there is anything further that I can do.

Regards.  Sara

Following up on my voice mail.

Chris Calger is looking for the underlying documentation for the swap between Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp. and Chase entered into on April 9, 1999.  A similar swap was entered into between the American Public Energy Agency and Chase on the same date.

A transaction diagram for the transaction is attached for your reference.

Please call either Chris or me with any questions.

Yes, all templates should include language covering corrections to published prices.

I had not heard back yet, but was planning to add that to our templates after I got your approval.  If you would like that email re-sent, please let me know.
The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.

The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:

page 2	-	2.2

Also, I'm uncertain of the following:

page 13-	1.2 	Is this "best execution" language alright?
page 17-	7.3	Is the "further assurance" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)?
page 28-	Schedule 3	Are these "LIFFE" terms fairly standard?
Appendix	This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.  Can't these be documented under an ISDA?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  And, thanks for your generous assistance.

Houston Astros Baseball season tickets are available sale to employees at their face value.  The seats range in price from $2,490 to $3,237 for the season, and are located in the box and club levels. 

If you're interested in being on the list of potential buyers for Enron's season tickets to the Astro's 2002 home games, please indicate your interest by 4PM, Central Time on Thursday, March 21 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you're interested in purchasing for the full season (no partial season or individual games).

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the "Confidentiality" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") or Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC").   I was asked to determine if the "Confidentiality" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) "the existence of a Master Agreement" or (b) "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the "Confidentiality" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose "the existence of a Master Agreement" or "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of "Confidentiality" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the "Confidentiality" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Cordially,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Sheila:

A few points:

(1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.

(2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.

(3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)

(4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?

(5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.

(6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?

(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.

Thanks.

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

(1)  Received a voice mail from Bill O'Brien (credit manager) of Select Energy at 860-665-2376.

He says that payments were previously made on the referenced invoices and he is pulling the data together.  He wants to talk on Thursday.  Louis, can you call him please?

(2)  Received a demand letter from Stone Energy Corporation which cites ENA's (i) failure to pay Stone $46,564 under the swap EV3943.1 which will be a default in 2 business days, and (ii) bankruptcy.  Stone may later designate an Early Termination Date.

Stone will also offset amounts owed by ENA Upstream Company to Stone.

Louis:  we need to verify the swap payment issue and I'll have a copy of the letter sent to you.

Just wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.  The major changes are credit related:  raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.

Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).  We have made some important changes since 1999.  I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.

Give me a call if you have a chance.  Thanks.

ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.

The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."

We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin?

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

Please review the following proposed outline of the credit lines for the proposed ISDA.


Collateral Threshold (tied to S&P and Moody ratings, lower of):	

	
					ConEd		Enron
	A+/A1 and above		$75,000,000	$60,000,000
	A, A-, A2, or A3			$60,000,000	$55,000,000
	BBB+, BBB, Baa1 or Baa2	$25,000,000	$50,000,000
	BBB- or Baa3			$5,000,000	$15,000,000
	Below BBB- or Baa3		$0		$0

I am trying to set parameters which give ConEd the credit that it deserves as an A+ regulated utility and Enron the credit it warrants as a BBB+ energy marketer.  Given the different business profiles of our companies, I don't believe that the application of parity should be practiced with regards to setting credit lines.  I think you would agree to this approach when looking at other market players, such as banks, municipalities, etc.  I hope we can come to agreement on the proposed credit lines, so that we can proceed with the negotiations of the ISDA.  Please call or reply with any comments or questions.

I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  Sara

Alan,

There is an outstanding $4m receivable due from Enron Re to ENA and various premiums in a lesser amount due from ENA to Enron Re (in relation to cover for the AIG puts). The EGM people are talking about offsetting one against the other. The rationale behind this "internal" settlement is not obvious to me but I am likely not in possession of all the facts. Do you know anything about this? How do you propose we handle? Thanks in advance. DEC

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

I spoke w/ Johnny Nor at Navajo today.  I told him that ENA could not wait any longer for Navajo's decision.  They have until 4PM Houston time TODAY, 3/20/02 to get a termination to ENA (via Stephanie Panus' fax: 713-646-4818).  He understands that if they do not terminate today ENA will terminate Navajo TODAY.  He gave me his fax number, 505-748-6742 (note that this is different from the fax number used for the demand letter).

Susan: Notes for the DDL.

Stephanie: Please watch the fax for a document from Navajo.

Sara: Based on the conversation w/ Nor I think we should be prepared to send a termination.  (Don't think Navajo will terminate.)  Call if you have questions.

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

Subject:	Limitation of Liability 

Hi, Mark:

ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:

	"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."

Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?

I'd appreciate your insight.

Regards,
Sara

Subject:	Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Subject:	UBS FX payment


Sara-thank you for looking into this issue for us.  Here is a brief
summary of what occured.


UBS and Enron entered into a Sterling-UBS spot transaction on 11-19-01,
which both parties confirmed and settled on 11-21. (UBS pays USD
7,083,500 and receives 5 mio sterling).

On 11-21 UBS and Enron erroneously confirmed the same trade again for
settlement on 11-21. UBS made a second USD 7,083,500 payment to Enron's
account at BA-Dallas on 11-21 (payment reference: FED IMA
1121B1Q8052C001081).

UBS did not receive the Sterling it was expecting and for the next few
days Enron and UBS tried to resolve the non-payment based on a mistaken
assumption that Enron owed 5 mio Sterling to UBS.

On 11-28, UBS realized that the trade was duped and on 11-29 informed
Enron of the nature of the error and requested that the USD payment be
returned. Enron agreed to return the USD payment on 11-29. The returned
payment was never received.

If you need additional information please contact me at 203-719-1141 or
Bryan Murtagh 203-719-8955.  Here are our contacts at Enron who are
aware of this issue.

I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

Tom and Bjorn:  Can you provide a Ted with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?

Alan:  Can you provide Ted and Mary Nell with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

Thanks.  SS

I have reviewed the following documents from CSFBI:

(1) Cancellation letter for five (5) swaps (which were never confirmed)
(2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE
(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc.  You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.

The documents are in the format agreed to with CSFBI on October 2.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Rudwell:

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.

It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

I just received two letters from IR dated 12/6/01 and 2/1/02 which were probably in a black hole somewhere or on Elliot Bonner's desk.  IR is terminating Commodity Swap Y810701 and demanding payment from ENA.

Kevin, can you please confirm that Y810701 is the only active financial swap between the two parties?  If it is not, then we cannot reflect that IR has terminated its swap(s).  We will also need

These are financial "out of the money" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for "termination" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.

Should this be reviewed by the "Intercompany Contract" group?

Is all this being worked with Nora Dobin?  I think some of these are in the volumetric production payment vehicles.  we need to be careful.  Nancy, will you call Nora Dobin?

Eric:  are any of these tied to the production payment deals?  Please advise us all.

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

Anyway, Louis and I are trying to get together with you and Alan Aronowitz to get up to speed on the status of Live CP's that were sent Demand Letters and to begin determining a process for moving ahead with terminated CP's.

We are able to meet in your building at whatever time works best for yours and Alan's schedules.

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.

(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?

(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.

Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara

Yes, all templates should include language covering corrections to published prices.  On October 9th, I forwarded an email to you requesting your review of that language that we received from Brent Hendry.  I had not heard back yet, but was planning to add that to our templates after I got your approval.  If you would like that email re-sent, please let me know.
The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.

I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment

Stephanie -

Where do we stand with respect to getting a document into National Energy Group, Inc.?  I need to push this forward, as this is a critical document.  Please let me know how we are proceeding on this.  

As a reminder, I want to have the ability to call for margin if NEGI's positions are any less than $4 million dollars in their favor.  I had put $3 million dollars in my prior email, but this figure should actually be $4 MM. 

I will be out Monday and Tuesday, but please contact Max Sonnonstine with any questions.


Thanks,

JRW

Stephanie and Sara -

We currently have several deals on the books with National Energy Group, Inc. that we confirmed under omnibus confirms.  The initial two deals that we did with them, TAGG numbers QY8453 and QY9133, required independent amounts and had the credit language attached.  I have attached those annexes below.  We have since executed the following trades:

VH0606
VH0931
VH0969
VH0982
VT5854
VT5861



Our positions with this counterparty have gone deep in the money to them, and they have asked us to send them back the collateral.  While I am not thrilled about doing this, I understand that this is a commercial issue and we probably need to do this to be responsive to the customer.  If you hadn't guessed by now, this is a Lagrasta customer, so I am getting the requisite incentive from Fred to get this done.

In concert with the return of their collateral, I want to send them a document that allows us to call for margin again if their positions start moving back in ENA's favor.  I want to be able to call them if their position moves any less than $3 million in their favor.  Right now, the positions are over $6 MM in National Energy Group's favor; I want to call them if that exposure changes to anything less than $3 MM in their favor.  This would still give us some "cushion".  

What do we need to do to make this happen?

Problem is that if Harvard does a deal with ENA and ENA back-to-backs it withe ECTRIC, we lose it from an exposure perspective. ENA probably never records the deal since it has a closed position. Then ECTRIC thinks it has a position with ENA so we lose the third party exposure.  The simple answer, I think, is if they want to trade Brent on EOL, then they probably need an ECTRIC ISDA since ENA cannot trade Brent on EOL, right?

Apparantly, Presidents & Fellows of Harvard wants to trade on EOL.  They were given a long-term guest ID that has since been closed out.  However, they still want to do these Brent deals and have them booked back-to-back so that they are under the ISDA with ENA.  Two things:

1)	We do not show the ISDA in CAS
?	$20MM Threshold
?	Executed as of 11/20/00
2)	Shouldn't the Brent deals that were booked back-to-back with ECTRIC be showing up in CAS, given that the purpose of this action was to bring the exposure under the ISDA?
?	Deal #s:	QP4223 and VA0834

Are we still ok with doing this back-to-back booking?  Also, how do we feel about this entity trading Metals (or should they even be trading Metals)?

The below email is from Rod to Sara in relationship to this whole issue.  I will be out tomorrow, but I told Sara today that I would be running this by you to see what your thoughts were on the issue.  Thanks for your help!  Would you let me know of the outcome.

Hi Sara.  This issue comes up fairly often.  My understanding is that Brent deals are automatically booked to ECTRIC for tax reasons.  The Brent product stack is managed here in London by folks who live, work and eat in the UK.  Since they are in effect generating earnings for the firm 'in' the UK, the tax argument is that the Inland Revenue should collect tax on this amount.  We could book to ENA, but I here that this could cause double taxation (being taxed again by the IRS).  Perhaps ECTRIC could do a back-to-back trade with ENA at the Brent mid price - thus still managing the product in the UK but generating no UK earnings (Inland Revenue may call foul though).

Having said this, we have successfully re-booked in the past when trades were done on the phone (apparently without tax consequence).  No one has taken a hard stand on the above - that I know of anyway.  I would recommend just telling the book admin to rebook to ENA and see if we get any resistance.  Clearly, from a credit perspective we would much prefer to book both legs at ENA.

Hope all else is going well.

Rod

Hey, Rod (the "Dude"):

Mr. Jason Williams of the Houston office has directed me to you.
I spoke with Harvard (has an ENA ISDA Master Agreement (the "Master") in place) who is trading on EOL (and all ENA trades are confirmed under the existing Master).  Harvard executed a crude/Brent spread trade on EOL and discovered that the counterparty was ECTRIC (and not ENA).  Boy, were they surprised!  

Harvard's request is whether ECTRIC can assign the trade to ENA.  Then, all of Harvard's trades would be subject to the ENA Master and could be netted.

Is this a commercial issue?  Does ENA need a "Brent book" to receive this trade? 

An assignment from ECTRIC to ENA would be only an "accommodation" to Harvard.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

P.S.  I never made it to London in June.  My boyfriend's mother was in the hospital then and she died two weeks later.  My mother died a few weeks ago.  It's been a bad summer.  But, I'm taking a vacation from August 23 - 31 and will be in London (staying at the Ritz).  Maybe we can have that drink!

I have reviewed the following documents from CSFBI:

(1) Cancellation letter for five (5) swaps (which were never confirmed)
(2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE
(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc.  You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.

The documents are in the format agreed to with CSFBI on October 2.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

It was Mark wilson who is no longer here.  I am trying to get a new name from the London people. 

Assuming they approve this what is the turnaround you think?

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Sara,
	We are looking to restart the process of  establishing an executing broker agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  We had temporarily put this on hold due to the WTC attack.  We have been given a new contact.  Sheila had previously already sent the memo to authorize going forward with the process.  Below are their requirements for account set up:

1.  Corporate Resolution
2.  Trading Authorization
3.  Settlement Instructions.


I am trying to get them to fax me their broker agreement.  As soon as I receive some documentation, I will forward to you.  

Thanks,
Theresa

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).  Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.

With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.

Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.

Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?

I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara

Kim:  Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that Beth Ng had originally faxed to me.

I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  

If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to Beth Ng per her message below.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Subject:	Seaport Group New Trading Counter Party


I just want to inform everybody that we are going to start trading with a new counter party called Seaport Group.  The employees of the counter party use to work for Amroc, which is an outfit we frequently traded with in the past.  The company is new but not the people at the organization.  If you have any question, please call.

Gil:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of "Specified Transaction".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only.

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.

Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).  Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.

The valuation info. that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.

Dear All,

Thank you to everyone who has helped out today with the hopeful transfer of Anker positions from Enron Credit Inc. to ECT Europe Investments Inc. for quarter end.

We are still working on an effective means to move the positions over.  

David Wall and Edmund Cooper in London will be working on this in the am for us.

From many discussions here today our options right now appear to be:

1.Transfer via stock power to ECTEI Inc.
Positions must be in certificate form first
Will take over a week to obtain certificates from DTC
NOT PLAUSIBLE

2. Set up prime broker account for ECTEI Inc. and transfer via DTC 
Must fill out paperwork and set up account before transfering position
Highly unlikely to accomplish in one day considering amount of paperwork and signatures required

3. Find a merchant account with a prime account already set up 
May not satify audit requirements, but many US entities have accounts
Possibly can find a Europe account with a custody or prime account that can accept DTC positions
Potential Cayman entities that roll to Europe with accounts

4. Internal structures
Suggestions Please

All:

Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.

ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate. 

Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Jay and Tanya:

Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.

(1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]

(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.

(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.

(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.

(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.

On a different note,

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.

(6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.

(7)  The names "Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc." and "Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.

QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  

QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?

Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

   could
   be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         I look forward to hearing from you

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the
            remaining
            documents.

            Thanks.

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         "Agreement")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

Hi Sara:

Happy Birthday. I had a great time in New Orleans but was unable to hook
up with Monty. Hopefully, I was able to succesfully forward to you my
reply to Donna's email about getting together this Thursday. I can not
wait to see you both. My cell number is 281-435-3672 if our plans need
to be changed. I will be out of town tomorrow and Wednesday, but back
Thursday. You can email me or leave a message at my office or call me on
my cell.

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.

Attached is a "recap" of outstanding issues with the utility.  I have not had any conversations with anyone at ConEd.

FYI, I did receive a call this afternoon from Sylvia Dooley asking that I call her about one of the unregulated affiliates.  I left a voice mail.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  Ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed.  Thanks.  Sara

Hi, Mark:

ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:

	"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."

Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?

I'd appreciate your insight.

Regards,
Sara

I heard about your new job and, what can I say except "Congratulations!".  I'm really excited for you.  I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.  

Believe it or not, your dad is very "with it" and knows what goes on in the real world.  I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.  The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).  Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.  You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).  He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.

I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).  Tell Park hi.

Sara

Hi Sara
How are you? hope you are doing well. I just got off the phone with my dad so i was thinking about you and wanted to say hi. I am comign home next weekend (March 22) and will be happyy to see you that saturday. I am only in town for like 40 hours so it is a short visit but i am looking forward to it. 
So I am sure my dad told you but i am taking another job. Starting Monday, I am the new Merchandising asst for Old Navy women's division and i am really excited about this. So Friday is my last day at Entertainment Weekly so this is a huge change.
I also have some other news but this is just btw you and me for now. I am working on ways to tell my dad so I wanted to see what you would suggest and advise. Park has asked me to move in with him and so I have decided that I want to do that. He and I are not ready to get engaged at all and not ready to get married but we are so in love and pratically live together now so this just makes sense. But i do not want to make my dad upset and am not sure how he would feel about this..... and so I was hoping you could give my any advice or suggest a way to tell this to him.... I hope that this does not put you in an awkward position and if so, then pelase tel me and I will not ask you anyhtign about it again. 
 
Thanks Sara. I hope you have a nice Monday and I am excited to see you in two weeks. Talk to you soon

Has Enron Credit filed for Bankruptcy?  [Shackleton, Sara]  not yet  If not, do we try to sell the positions? [Shackleton, Sara]   Enron Credit Limited is reviewing the positions and I am engaging our bankruptcy lawyers to see what type of structure is plausible  I do not even know who the Authorized traders are on the account.

Sara,

The attached shows our balances at GS and Bear Stearns.

1) Bear Stearns owes us $3.9 million to ECT Investments, Inc.
	Ena is owed 159,022
	Enron Credit Inc has positive liquidating equity at BS of $14,013,523 which includes cash and positions.

2) Goldman Sachs ENA account grouping includes a positive cash balance of 1,493,288 which belongs to Enron Credit Inc.  As discussed, GS will not touch any monies relating to ENA.

3)  Enron Credit Inc. has a positive cash balance of 132,680 at MSDW.  It is segregated from any other entity's balances.

Adding up all three pieces of Enron Credit is $15.6 million, which includes positions and cash balances and presumes that the market value used by the prime broker is correct for some of these illiquid positions.

Please call so we can discuss.

Thanks. 
Sheila

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

Per my voice mail, attached is the "draft" guaranty for FIMAT (you have a hard copy).  I can't remember if I marked any other changes on ;your version that are not in the attachement.

I would let FIMAT know that Soc Gen just signed this version (except for the cap) in December, 2000.  I have a copy of it in my futures agreement file.

If you need any help finding this while I'm out, please call Marie Heard at X 33907.

is this the file I sent last week?  NYMEX - I would talk to Elaine Schield or Greg Whiting; however, this data is as of 11/30 before terminations and the like - so we may well have had open positions on the nymex.  I suspect it is made up of the forward value to the contracts, accrued interest, etc. I have no idea what the number is today - again Elaine or Leslie Reeves would be the best contact.  I suspect there are entries for both JPM and Chase Man because our back office was booking to both places even though that was not correct.  If the back office doesn't move the deals over, the data will be in both places.  It is all about data integrity - there will be many issues like this, I suspect.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

Thanks.

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Thank you and best regards,

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

ECT received a default notice from GSI dated December 3, 2001.  The signature is illegible. There is a path in the upper right hand margin which reads "Draft: (GWN/MJR)

The letter terminates the Prime Brokerage Agreement between ECT and GSI dated "20 August 2000".  As you know, our agreement was dated August 24, 2001.  Can you direct this email to the appropriate GSI person for termination of the appropriate agreement?

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

Subject:	FW: Put Confirmations:  ENE as "Seller" and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. as "Buyer" (or "Lehman")

Rex, Jim and Clint:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  Sara

Clint,

Just FYI, we are revising the two put confirmations we sent out to you
earlier to reflect the discussions you previously had with Russ around
settlement.  We will correct the confirms to include only physical
settlement at maturity, and we will send them out shortly.

I have verified that ECI, although a non-debtor entity, must have all proposed dispositions of assets or liquidation of positions approved by Ernst & Young ("E&Y").  Brent Hendry's memo of December 20, 2001 contains the phone/fax numbers for Cindy Ma who is our contact person.  Cindy's email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.

Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.

Just copy me in case I receive a call.

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Subject:	Payment Date for financial power transactions

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

(1)  I thought you said that there were specific transactions in the U.S. entities.  I need a list of trades booked in the names of Enron Credit Inc. and Enron North America Corp.

(2)  I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.

(3)  I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.  I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  Sylvia is preparing a new version.

We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.

Ed:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:

(1)	credit event upon merger:  Con Ed coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal

(2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.

(3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)

(4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's

(5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.

(6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral

(7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB

(8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC

Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

"The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of "Reverse Transaction" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation

Subject:	Hey

Hi Sara
How are you doing? I am so sorry to hear about all the stress happening over there. I am thinking about and hope you can take a vacation soon! Things here are fine. Just getting ready for the holidays. I was hoping to talk to you about gifts for my dad. I am not sure what to get him. I got him a subscription to Sports Illustrated and was thinking about getting him  DVD player. What are your suggestions?
Anythign would be a huge help! And I am excited to see you in New Orleans too. I am there for a week and hoping to spend some time with you all. Have a good day.
Oh and Park's friend is Nick Barnard and he is in the financial dept.

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin

Ed:


The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:

Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.

The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.

Can you give me a status on this request?  I have your name as the contact person to accomplish this.

Thanks!

As mentioned, we would like to review gas financial transactions.  As a start, we would like to obtain confirmations, and individual transaction MTM's, for the transactions associated with the 10 largest In the Money counterparties (as measured by positive net MTM)

Sheila:  attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.  Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc.  A few things for you to note and we can chat quickly:

(1)  Par. 5 - will we agree to a fee schedule now or "as agreed to from time to time"?

(2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?

(3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?

(4)  Par. 14 - will you need to object by phone (or is fax sufficient)?

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.

ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].

Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Sara -

I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a "unilateral" approach to
include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted by
PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney) and
he is inclined to not agree to your request (our approach is either if
applied to both of us or neither of us).

Let me know if you need to discuss this further - in which case we will get
on a call (Yair, you and myself) to discuss.

Regards,
Michelle

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff
for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with the
regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.  I look forward to hearing from

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the

   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature

   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

Kathryn:

The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject:	RE: ConfirmLogic Target Customer List-Legal Entity Name

Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

Thanks.

Beth Ng keeps calling me about the ELFI trades; she wants to rebook to ENA.  Any ideas?

Beth Ng at Morgan has requested that trades in the names of Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. ("ELFI"), Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. and Enron Gas Liquids (physical and financial) be "novated" or transferred to ENA.  Beth is aware that this is a credit issue.

I have copies of four (4) financial confirms between Morgan and ELFI.  These were produced by Morgan for Trade Dates February 28, 2001 (30,000 BBL total ethane), March 6, 2001 (30,000 BBL total propane),March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane) and March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane).

Beth has probably contacted Jeff Hodge and/or Alan Aronowitz on the physical side with the same request.

Thanks.  Sara

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May.

Sara-

As discussed, I am forwarding the correspondence from Beth Ng of Morgan Stanley containing the draft netting agreements (based on the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. forms provided to Morgan Stanley) to be entered into by EGLI and ERAC.  

I am attaching below, amended versions of the netting agreements that Morgan Stanley would like to enter into today.  I note that Tom Moran, who heads up EGM credit, would like to get Morgan Stanley comfortable ASAP.

Let me know if there is any problem with entering into these arrangements.

Thanks for your help.

John

Tom:

Further to my voice mail, attached is a "short list" of FX/rate desk financial counterparties.  We will need an aggregate ENA exposure before attempting to negotiate ENA's in-the-money positions on a commodity by commodity basis (i.e., the FX/rate exposure, in particular).  I will speak with Clara Carrington about segregation of the terminated trades from their books.
 
I'd like to sit down with you and Sheila Glover as soon as possible to strategize.
 
Thanks.  Sara

Laurel and Sara.  UBS has an Internet Module that they are going to start using for "Verbal Confims" on FX trades.  You can see a little of what it contains, but they have informed me that we have to be set up with ID's and passwords, sign a contract etc.  The contact at UBS is Max Squire and he will provide me with more info when needed.  Max has explained to me that as the trades are entered into the system we will go in and mark confirmed when we agree.  It sounds very interesting to me.  Let me know what you think.  I can ask Max to send me the paperwork for your review.

Thank you.

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

Hi Sara,

I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft
Credit Support Annex (similar in form to the one previously executed with
ENA).  I understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can
leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime.

Thanks and regards,

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.

Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.

(1)  Louis/Mike:

	(i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to Samantha.
	(ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.

(2)  Samantha:

When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.

(3)  Angelo:

If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,

Tom:

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.

We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.

This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.

I have not pulled the Master Netting Agreement today.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Tanya and Jay:

I need someone to please look into the following trades with various Enron entities (other than ENA) identified by Beth Ng of Morgan and whether these were booked incorrectly or should properly be booked in the names of the following affiliates:

Enron Liquids
Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. (oil option)
EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately)

Also, there have been trades for physical settlement, such as, an "oil forward" and a "gas TBP forward".  Maybe Jeff knows the answer to this one.

Thanks.

The following parties have either tired of speaking with us or would still like to agree to settlement:

San Diego Gas & Electric (Not Terminated)
RBC
SEB

Francisco was handling SDG&E; I have been working on the latter two (which were both subject to termination notices).

Attached is the EOL Amendment that Stacy Dickson has already prepared for Texaco and sent to Mark.  Power does not need to see it as stated below since Power does not do any business with Texaco.  Can you incorporate your financial comments into the version below?

Sheila:

A few points:

(1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.

(2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.

(3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)

(4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?

(5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.

(6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?

(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.

Thanks.

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

"The Parties shall designate Enron North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and Enron North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

     Mr. Michael Hartley
     Ms. Yumi Ito

  of SMBC London


2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost

  We understnad the definition of "Reverse Transaction" in the
  Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
  calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
  excluding any margin,(not with Libid)

Appreciate your confirmation

(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Tom:  Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Thanks.  Sara

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Kevin

Thanks for the quick response.  Your "business day" suggestion is fine.  With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.  We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.  Hope this helps.  Sara

Sara,

For the purposes of margin, defining a business day as those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston will work.  For the purposes of error notification, we should remove "business day" and insert something along the lines of "market day" and define "market day" as any day that the market on which the contract traded is open.  There are a few days the markets are open but the banks are closed.   Will that work for you?

Both Morgan Stanley and Enron are registered with the NFA.  Is there a specific reason you can't agree to NFA arbitration?

Regards,

Tammy

We provided CSFB puts just like Lehman.  We did that the last time we had to move the trigger price since our stock price was declining.  As a result of us giving them puts, they took the trigger price out which means that we don't have to renegotiate the confirms every time our stock heads south.  Jeff, would you please get the details of the puts to Sara.  Thanks.

Sara-

We will prepare execution copies of the confirmations for the various
transactions and send them to you.  Before we do that, though, do you know
the status of the puts [Shackleton, Sara]   I never heard mention of the puts ?

Jane:

I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.

I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:
(1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date
(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
(3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. 

Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.

Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.

Regards.  Sara

 << File: Final.doc >> Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May.

Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

Mark:  Please read the attached message.

(1)  Are there any issues with following the "custom" in countries not requiring an executed "executing brokerage agreement"?  Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?

(2)  I anticipate that I will really need help on the brokerage agreement side.  I cannot keep up now on a "timely" basis.

Gary's world occupies about 50% of my time.
Enron Corp. occupies about 25% of my time.

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the

   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature

   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.

ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate. 

Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.

With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff

   Sara -

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

   Regards,
   Michelle

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

Just a few notes from the Agreement:

(1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin
(2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA)
(3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed "from time to time"
(4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please?
(5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days?
(6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation
(7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades

Thanks.  Sara

Sara  I have been concerned about your status and wanted to check and see if you were still around.  (I do not know many people in the ENA/EWS but like the few I know!) 
 
I am in Brazil this week straighterning out the mess.  
 
FYI, they are actually doing financial derivatives.  The government does not recognize them as such but that is clearly what they are.

Just wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.  The major changes are credit related:  raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.

Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).  We have made some important changes since 1999.  I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.

Give me a call if you have a chance.  Thanks.

You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.

What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Mark Ellenberg is the N.Y. Cadwalader lawyer who is assisting Houston on a regular basis (he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system).  Mark has asked Michelle Duncan with Cadwalader's U.K. office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ECTRIC and other trading/bankruptcy issues.  I was thinking that the U.S. process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in London and a Cadwalader lawyer (with trading experience) could make use of Mark's experience with pre- and post-filing "Enron" issues.

Subject:	Amendment to IRCEA

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

Beth Ng at Morgan has requested that trades in the names of Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. ("ELFI"), Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. and Enron Gas Liquids (physical and financial) be "novated" or transferred to ENA.  Beth is aware that this is a credit issue.

I have copies of four (4) financial confirms between Morgan and ELFI.  These were produced by Morgan for Trade Dates February 28, 2001 (30,000 BBL total ethane), March 6, 2001 (30,000 BBL total propane),March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane) and March 26, 2001 (150,000 BBL total propane).

Beth has probably contacted Jeff Hodge and/or Alan Aronowitz on the physical side with the same request.

Thanks.  Sara

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

Sheila,

At this time, there are no updates to report on deferred compensation since the bankruptcy filing.  As you know, the assets of the plan(s) are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors.  Thus, no distributions (current or future) can be made.  We sent a letter to you on December 10th with your 11/30/01 balance in the event that you wished to file a claim with the bankruptcy court for your deferral benefit.  We also indicated that the Company would explore options with its creditors to seek approval to restart the deferral plan(s).  To my knowledge, these talks have not begun.  However, I will see if I can find out any additional information to pass on to you.

On the December 10, 2001 letter we indicated that we would forward your "Life to Date Deferrals" at a later date.  This follow-up letter should be sent out to you next week.

Sara,

I've been working with Carrie Richardson (Andersen auditor) regarding master contracts covering interest rate and foreign currency transactions.  The Global Contracts group has been able to find almost all the contracts with a few exceptions.  

The first, between ENA and HSBC Futures Inc., was set up in the Legal tracking database but we never did receive the actual documents.  The record in Global Contracts was finally trade suspended (as a result of a previous audit) until we can locate that documentation.  We do have an agreement between the CP and RMT. [Shackleton, Sara]  This agreement is a Futures Agreement [Shackleton, Sara]  ; I'm confused about RMT's arrangement with HSBC (we only use RMT for ISDA agreements with ENA) 

We also cannot locate a master agreement between ENA and BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp.  Georgi Landau has checked the Legal tracking database and didn't find anything there either.  Carrie has requested two transactions for this CP. [Shackleton, Sara]    This agreement is a repo agreement. 

Can you please try to locate master agreements for these counterparties?  If you are not the person I need to speak to, can you please direct me to someone else?  I'd like to give Carrie an answer as soon as I can.

Thanks,

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help

Lisa:

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

I need to review that amendment before approving the Second Amendment.  Also, did you have a prior agreement as to the effective date of this amendment?

Ed and Rob:  the ISDA Schedule markup by Con Ed is attached; the CSA will follow.  

Ed:  Can you resolve credit issues with Triche before the end of next week?  I think credit will drive a major part of the agreement.  

Do you guys want to meet early next week?

I'm sure this is not new to you but Cindy Ma just called.  I guess Raj was trying to schedule a meeting today for lawyers (in/out) to meet for several hours with these guys who are only here today.  I punted to you guys.  She's asking specifically about strategies for terminated/nonterminated positions and other time sensitive issues.  Also wants people like Sager, Hodge, etc.

Subject:	JP Morgan Chase  ("Chase") and Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  ("Morgan")

Jay and Tanya:

Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.

(1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]

(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.

(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.

(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.

(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.

On a different note,

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.

(6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.

(7)  The names "Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc." and "Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.

QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  

QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?

Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

Attached is the list which I created when Mark left town on August 31.  He sent a rash of emails to me (from Stacy) and I assigned per the list.  I had Texaco on my list because he mentioned it to me in a voice mail.  If there are any names missing from the list, let me know.  Sara

Attached is the EOL Amendment that Stacy Dickson has already prepared for Texaco and sent to Mark.  Power does not need to see it as stated below since Power does not do any business with Texaco.  Can you incorporate your financial comments into the version below?

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

David:

Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.  Please review the redlined language.

The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.

NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.

I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.

Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.

Can you give this a quick review?  Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.  Thanks.

Sure; I think we can do that now.  I thought we might approach it as we organize each file on a counterparty basis but we certainly do not need to wait.  However, we will not be able to reconcile trades, etc. until we have the credit review for each counterparty and I expect that this may be a hindrance.

Attached is a list of the counterparties who have provided termination payment calculations.  I have identified whether or not such counterparty provided backup to its calculation, but obviously cannot determine if such backup is sufficient.  For all new notices, backup will be identified when the notice is recorded on the termination log.  I did not look at the ECC or London entities.  For the US entities, we have begun to make files for those counterparties who submitted a calculation, but the files only contain the termination notices at this time.  As I understand, we will be focusing on the non-terminated in-the-money, then the terminated in-the-money.  Therefore, we have not begun pulling the contracts for these counterparties.


 << File: Counterparty Calculations.xls >> 

We have been concentrating on the non-terminated in-the-money financial contracts.  For each counterparty, we are pulling 1) the financial agreement, 2) all financial confirmations live as of November 30, 2001, 3) any physical agreements for that counterparty, and 4) any physical confirmations live as of November 30.

Tthanks for the heads-up.  What is the full name of this party?  Exactly what "ISDA" did you  leave for them to review (i.e., was this a customized agreement with credit?)?  Can I please have a copy in case someone calls me.

Thanks.  Sara

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Jane McBride

Ps. I didn't make it to the GM Legal Conference this time but hope it went well and to see you in May.

Do we need to meet briefly about the extent of these EOL amendments?  I'm also thinking of AEP.

Hi Ellen.

Finally I have gotten changes from our Attorney to the EOL Amendment.
Please review our changes and let me know if you have any comments.

Sorry for the delay.

Thanks.

Tammy:

Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:

(1)  We need to define "business day"  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.

(2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?

Please let me hear form you.

Sara,

I'm attaching a draft of the futures agreement to "get the ball rolling"
again.  I believe I have included the terms you indicated were most
important.  One item I would like to bring to your attention is the
arbitration clause.  Morgan Stanley prefers to litigate disputes, but I
can agree to NFA arbitration rather than litigation.  I know New York is
our preferred location, and Texas is yours, so I thought that holding
the arbitration in Chicago might equally inconvenience us.   Please let
me know if this works for you.

Regards,

Tammy

I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

San Diego Gas & Electric (Not Terminated)
RBC
SEB

Francisco was handling SDG&E; I have been working on the latter two (which were both subject to termination notices).

Are you looking solely for Enron Corp. executory contracts?

We can identify the Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements (which are safe harbor contracts under the Code) as well as securities contracts (also safe harbor contracts).  Please be a bit more specific.

Thanks.  Sara

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it.

Sara -

At the point the language was agreed to in the below agreement we may not
have been aware of the regulatory contraints under PUHCA that does not allow
for the inclusion of Affiliates under Set-Off (we may actually have to amend
that agreement to carve it out).

With respect to the our ISDA, I will make sure to forward to Anthony the
provision in question and ask him when he has some availability to get on a
call in the beginning of next week to discuss.

Per my voice mail, please:

Power Marketing, Inc., as amended, for your previously negotiated setoff
language, and

   I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a "unilateral" approach
   to
   include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted
   by
   PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney)

   applied to both of us or neither of us).

      the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of
   ISDA
      (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached
   is

      that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of
   agreement
      since it is the final version.

       <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

      Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
      which
      point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
      page)
      via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
      Schedule with your revised Schedule.

      Thank you for your patience.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.

Sara!

We are ok with eliminating the CSA from the ISDA with Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).  However, we would like to add an additional termination event, of debt rating change below A for OUC and BBB- for Enron Corp.

Richard!

In the absence of any margin rights, we will be monitoring trading activities with this counterparty more closely and this may result in certain transactions limitations.

fax from genre....

sara -- to bring you up to speed, BNP Paribas decided they could not go forward with the transaction.  We were able to get GenRe back into the trade late Friday night and are attempting to complete the novation/assignement over the next couple of days.  In order to reduce concerns over potential clawbacks, I think it is best to take this transaction through the Houston process.

Can you let me know exactly what needs to be done and I will start working on our side.  Thanks.

Even though we have already terminated this counterparty, I received a voice mail today (caller did not leave name ) for a commercial person to contact the company to discuss a settlement proposal.  The phone number is 303-978-4965.  The termination was not mentioned.

All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES.
The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
Please respond.  Thanks for your help.

That's always been an issue.  I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.  ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc.  Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.  Sara

Ed made the point that we need to make sure we have picked up all commodities associated with the contracts we send demand letter for.  I'll talk to Angelo to see if he picked up all commodities.  If not we may need to slow down (unfortunately) in order to sweep the landscape for other commodity unpaid invoices (besides gas).

Sara -

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Regards,
Michelle
