Subject: Houston Astros Corporate Playoff Tickets and Suite




The Houston Astros are on track to clinch their 4th Central Division title in five years and return playoff baseball to Houston and for the first time at Enron Field.  Though many business units have their own tickets for these games, the Corporate Marketing team would like to make the corporate tickets listed below available to the Management Committee on a first come, first serve basis for the 2001 playoff games tentatively scheduled to begin around October 9th.

Enron's Corporate Suite (includes 14 tickets and two parking passes) 
Four (4) Diamond Club Level 
Four (4) Club Level 
Four (4) Dugout Level 
Four (4) Field Level 


We will be accepting requests for these tickets by game number and by series. (Ex. If you were requesting tickets to Game 2 of the League Championship Series (LCS) you would be asking for tickets to a game that could be played on October 10 or October 13 , per the schedule below, depending if the Astros have home field advantage.)  As in the past, these tickets will be billed to your company number and cost center.    

If a game is listed as "if necessary" there is no guarantee that this game will be played due to various reasons such as home field advantage and length of series.  If you select one of these games and it is not played, the game will not be able to be replaced with another game.  Tickets for games not played will not be charged to your company number and cost center.

Please respond to Greg Grissom by email ( <mailto:greg.grissom@enron.com>) if you would like to request tickets or if you have any questions.  

The playoff game schedule and costs associated with these tickets are as follows: 

2001 Astros Home Playoff Ticket Cost

Take a look at these pics! For anyone who has worked or visited the WTC area, these pics are incredible. Just looking at the devastation to the surrounding buildings is shocking.  My friend worked at Banker's Trust at 130 Liberty and these pictures were taken from and around that building. Sherron

Hi daddums.  Call me for great news!  Too good for e-mail.  Here's my info.
I sent it to mom, as I'm sure she'll want it too:

Show tickets are for:

Reference number for show tickets (in case I lose them):

Also, remind me to give you my tax return info.  Noel forwarded it to me
yesterday, as it got sent back from the Rushing River address.  I got $500 in
traveler's checks and $197 in pounds to start off.  I also plan on getting
about $100 in US dollars before I go.  I'll start packing Wednesday afternoon
to make sure I don't forget anything.  If you think of anything important for
me (besides umbrellas and toothbrush), please let me know asap.  I would also
appreciate a receipt notification from this e-mail, as it contains very
important information.  Haha, do I sound official enough?  Tell Ann Ducharms
and Ted Murphy that I appreciate everything they have done for me.  I think
that's about it.  Talk to you later!

All the very best,
Jules

Mr. Fleming:

Thanks so much for the helpful letter on membership and general information. Your letter indicated that I should make application through the Membership Committee, who would provide me with an application. You copied Cmde. Roth on the letter so I will contact him to request an application or schedule a meeting. (I have no contact information for him other than through the PYC, is that appropriate?) 

I found a potential slip at Great Cove Boat Club and was wondering if you had heard of this marina and if other members used this facility.

Thanks again for getting back to me.

Richard (Rick) Buy

P.S. I heard on the news one of the pilots was from Portsmouth. So tragic. I'm sure people there are as devastated as they are here.

Subject:	New Legal Team to Assist RAC

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Thanks for your note. I want to wish you the best of luck in EES. As far as RAC's issues with EES, I would suggest getting together with Tribolet and getting some of the lists that have been put together as part of the task force. I would also suggest attending the task force meeting, providing EES management is agreeable, to get a better picture of what is going on.

Again, I hate to see you go but it will still be value added to RAC and Enron. Have fun!!

Tim- Thanks for your note. Before Janet D. left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place. We have assigned Tracy Ngo, Ed Sacks, Paul Radous and Wendy Conwell to power. We also have moved other RAC people into credit, Mark Ruane (VP), Ken Curry (Dir), and Carol North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. We are in the market for more.

It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, does being in Houston work or do we need resources in Portland. 

I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in Houston and get her views as well. 

Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the Enron curve. Thanks, Rick

Subject:	Credit Resources

I understand from Tracy Ngo that as a result of some organizational changes in RAROC there might be some personnel movement in your group.  As indicated in the e-mail below, our Portland Middle Market Group would like to see more resources dedicated to the credit function.  As a result of a number of factors credit is being asked to review a very large number of new counterparties and transactions for the Middle Market Group and it is typically taking 2 - 7 days to get a credit review turned around.  As you know, we believe existing personnel is top notch   There just aren't enough of them.  And, amongst all the RAC groups with whom we work, market risk and credit risk, it seems like resources are more constrained in the credit area.  We would love to see that reduced and anything you could do to make this happen would be appreciated.  

Thanks

Tim

Subject:	Credit Resources

Bill:

As I think you are aware, the Middle Market (MM) Group in Portland has been interacting with your credit group with increasing frequency.  We are counting on you to complete credit analyses that allow MM deals to be closed.  Although I don't think we have lost any deals as a result of the not doing credit analyses in time, we have been on the edge for weeks and a couple of deals have come down to the wire.  Anything you can do to allocate additional resources to credit analysis would be appreciated.

There are 3 forces currently aligned that make MM success highly contingent upon your credit group doing credit analyses to allow transactions to be closed. 

1.  Movement from WSPP to EEI contracts.  We are at a record pace with respect to getting new master agreements in place with counterparties.  Already this year we have done about 10 - 15 new EEIs, all of which require a credit analysis.  

2.  We continue to look at longer dated transactions that require special credit analysis.

3.  California credit risks are particularly high given what is going on with the "energy crisis."

The quality of work we get from Tracy, Ed, Wendy and Paul is nothing less than phenomenal.  We also have implemented a priority list that we use to identify the most critical transactions so we do not overburden your people with trivial requests.  It still takes typically about a week to get a credit worksheet done for a new EEI and most new deals are requiring an EEI.  In some cases, a quicker turn around is essential.  It seems to us that additional resources are warranted.  

I am pretty sure you are aware of this and are taking whatever action you can, but I thought it would be useful to document our needs to arm you with information if you  have internal negotiations to manage.  

Please let me know if you have any questions at 503/464-3822. 

Thanks!

Chris

Rick,
Thanks so much for the hospitality last week down in Houston.  I spoke to Gene regarding your offer to sit down and give us some of your expertise and you helping us to evaluate where we are,  what we need to do and the best course to get there.    I also discussed info sensitivity and neither of us see this as a big risk.  I would like to proceed with this asap.   i will be down in Houston on Wednesday (meeting with Lou Pai and gene and others) and could stay on longer if there was a chance to meet, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.  Friday is possible although slightly tougher.   Otherwise could you suggest some time.  Regards,
Bill

Gentlemen:

	Bob and I would like to schedule a joint session of the Audit and Finance
Committees, perhaps at the August meeting, to cover the following topics
(and any others which occur to you):

1.	how and why are the trading and investment policies (and levels specified
therein) established;

2.	how and why are the VAR and maximum expected loss limits set;

3.	how useful is the VAR methodology as it is extended outside of the
wholesale gas and electricity business.

	It would also be useful to update the Committees on the post-audits of
recent investments and perhaps on the larger "asset" investments such as
Dabhol, Electrol, Cuiaba, etc.  Even as we move away from these investments,
there may be some additional lessons to be learned.  Does our post-audit
process and procedure continue?

	We could meet briefly in May to discuss the idea of a joint meeting and the
proposed agenda, if that is convenient.

	Best regards.

Subject: Amended Complaint in Amalgamated Bank v. Lay, et al.



Good evening, everyone.  Mike Peterson, who many of you have met and who is working with J.C. on your case, asked me to send the following e-mail to you:

The lawyers for Amalgamated Bank filed an amended class action complaint yesterday. Based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one (our comparison was "line by line" but not "word for word"), it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely, "to order an accounting of insider-trading proceeds," "disgorgement of insider-trading proceeds," "restitution of investors' monies of which they were defrauded," and "as to the section 11 claims, awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages." These additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys. The amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action. If you nonetheless would like your own copy of the amended complaint (all 78 pages), just let me know and I will send it to you.



This e-mail and any attached files may be confidential and subject to attorney/client privilege. If you received it in error, please immediately notify the sender by return e-mail or by calling (713)654-7600.

My name is Rick Buy and I saw your note in Points East magazine indicating you could take on some new members. This sounds terrific to me. Are there still "opening"s?

I own a 25 foot Boston Whaler, am new to the area, and would like to meet some nice people and would like to join others on a cruise occasionally. My wife, Janice, likes boating as well but neither of us owns an ascot.

I would love to give you a call and discuss this but I thought I would write this email first.

Rick,
All the risk info and personnel are in Houston.  risk mngt and the core controllers are at Jefferson Street.  The programmers etc... who have had input are also in that office.   Because we do not have a team built yet (my primary task) we will need to pull from varied resources. 
Hence,  although i understand the distraction of being so close to HQ I still think it favors being down there.

Bill

Rick,
Thanks so much for the hospitality last week down in Houston.  I spoke to Gene regarding your offer to sit down and give us some of your expertise and you helping us to evaluate where we are,  what we need to do and the best course to get there.    I also discussed info sensitivity and neither of us see this as a big risk.  I would like to proceed with this asap.   i will be down in Houston on Wednesday (meeting with Lou Pai and gene and others) and could stay on longer if there was a chance to meet, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday.  Friday is possible although slightly tougher.   Otherwise could you suggest some time.  Regards,
Bill

Cut the present sealant with a razor knife and remove deck.
The remaining sealant can be scraped off with a plexiglass or acrylic
scraper (this allows you to easily remove the sealant without scratching
the gelcoat).
A new light tan or beige silicone sealant can be ordered through most
marine suppliers or your local Boston Whaler dealer (sorry, no factory
direct).
Whaler uses a silicone from Starbrite Co., Whaler part# 1081694 or
Starbrite's vendor part number 82180.
Please call 1-800-Whaler-9 or check the dealer locator on the Whaler
website for the location of your nearest Boston Whaler dealer for parts
pricing and availability.

Rick: 
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned about the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprardy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX clearing falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYMEX payment performance?????

Per Rick Buy's request, we are developing procedures so that the head of each RAC department will have a current list of emergency contact numbers for all RAC employees.  I have outlined the plan below:

The Assistant in each group will be responsible for updating home telephone numbers, cellular phone numbers and home addresses for each member of their group.  Rita Hennessy will consolidate the list for all of RAC on a monthly basis.
The monthly update will be emailed to the personal email address of each department head or their designee.  This update should be stored on a personal computer until the next monthly update is received.
Two hard-copies of the monthly update will be maintained in a file at the home of Rick Carson and at the home of Sharon Sullo.

If this plan is acceptable to you, please let me know the personal email address to use.  Please call me with comments or questions.

Thanks,

Sharon

Subject:	Business Rationale for Retention 


As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why these employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please provided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally, if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vulnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if your unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of assets, include this in your business summary. 

Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a similar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended for the Milestone Program.  As you know this information is time sensitive, so please try and get it to me as soon as possible.  I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.  Please call me (5x3662) if you have any questions.

Based on recent discussions with several energy firms, there appears to be
interest in conducting a survey which
*	summarizes the current state of risk management best practices
within the industry, and
*	provides benchmark data addressing current levels of risk based
performance for various energy related lines of business

To respond to this interest, we would like to conduct a survey which
addresses these goals. We have prepared a proposal which outlines our
approach for conducting a survey, and provides samples of expected output. I
will be in touch sometime next week to discuss the proposal with you, and
determine your interest in participating.

I look forward to speaking with you, and potentially working with you as a
participant in this project.

I have run an indicative credit reserve which comes out at $15m.

It should be made clear at this stage the number is only indicative and subject to further change and discussion.  Forward price curves and volatilities will need to be confirmed, as will the option structure.

We still want to achieve the best possible contractual terms through pursuing collateral rights and should consider other risk-mitigating options such as bankruptcy protection.  The tenor and $ exposure would warrant sign-off at a very senior level, and will obviously be covered by the DASH approval.

The deal is clearly of great value to Enron, but we should question the motives of Balli in wanting or needing to do this.  How much do we know about their exisiting banking relationships and ability to access funding at present?

I'm sure we will discuss further.

Paul

Bruce Garner has asked me to bring you into a trade we're looking at with Balli-Klockner (BK). Ken Curry was asked to evaluate a related proposal a week back but is now on holiday and Rebecca Phillips was not brought up to speed. This latest proposal would be a European trade and the client is under time constraints and keen to move fast.

The transaction is as follows:

Enron has the right to sell to BK physical Hot Rolled Coil steel at Index (CRU HRC) + 7.5% 

Start:  Jan2002

End:    Dec2016

Tonnage:        500 000 Metric Tonnes per annum (total tonnage: 7.5 million MT)

Enron pays a premium of 30 million USD upon contracting.

The CRU Index is Enron's benchmark steel index and physical steel trades at Index flat. There is thus 7.5% intrinsic value in the puts which translates to approx. $75 million USD in present value terms ($45million net of premium).

Our counterparty would be the parent of the soon to be combined Balli Klockner PLC and the various Balli service centres soon to be merged (BK Holdings Ltd UK). BK are not offering us additional credit relief, ie. bank guarantees, LC's, insurance bonds, etc. Your help in establishing our appetite and an appropriate credit charge for this transaction would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

Simon Cose

Please ring Draper at AEP

Current position:

We have paid them all of the margin  they have contractual rights for - $33.5mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract.
However, they want full collateral on all of their power position (this is being driven by Bill Reid on their power floor -ex Enron employee), the amount is another $220mm (they have no collateral rights to this). 

Essentially, the credit guy (Frank Hilton) is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated.  I believe some of this is vindictive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what he is up to.

The paper transaction you asked about in the staff meeting is with E.W. Scripps Company, S&P rated A/stable.  The deal has not been signed and the contract is still being negotiated.  We gave the marketers a preliminary approval based on the existing credit threshold of $10 million.  We have not valued the exposure or credit reserve since we do not have final transaction details.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
      Ken

Subject:	RE: DASH re Cuiaba GSA with YPF/Andina

Is every contract entered into at ETS done with a DASH?  At TGS we enter into numerous transport contracts and they are not covered by a DASH?  In Central America we market our power out of the various plants and these contracts are not subject to a DASH.  Similar circumstances can be described at Promigas, Ventane, Calife, SK/Enron, Elektro and the Gas LDCs.  If what you describe is accurate, then we are not even close to compliance and the G&A investment necessary to comply will be huge.

Jim- J Block was just a gas contract. At Enron, risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doesn't fit into a book.

Help me understand why a DASH is being done for a gas contract?  The DASH process exists to approve uses of capital, not entering into a gas contract?  Am I missing something?

He's right in that looking at curves where we generally don't have much of a position, will not add much value. I'm having Frank Hayden check this assertion. 
Bottom line is, again, the middle office groups are either poorly staffed, poorly skilled or too distracted to administer the risk process effectively.

When Frank comes back to me I'm tempted to suggest two things, for which I'll need Whalley/Lavorato/Beck to buy into:

1	Curve validations are submitted to us before anybody else;
2	They concentrate on more significant factors (e.g. Volatility, correlation, the Alberta Power curve)

Subject:	Portfolio Group Activities

Rick:  In addition to our normal activities related to board reporting, PortRAC maintenance, compliance and SWAT work, we have the following major project initiatives underway:

DASH SPENDING CONTROLS - We are leading the team to develop an "AFE-type" cost accumulation system so that every project in Enron will have accurate and timely cost expenditure numbers to ensure that appropriate DASH's and approval levels have been obtained.

BANKRUPTCY REPORTING DATA - We have taken responsibility for developing the reporting function for the new bankruptcy group.  We are working with Michael T. and Credit to develop what data we need, where in the organization we get it and what kind of reports we generate with it.

POST TRANSACTION REVIEWS -  We will provide the primary resources to perform these Board mandated reviews.  Paper mills, Garden State and Daishowa will be reviewed this quarter in conjuction with Underwriting.

EES - We are working with Credit to monitor the EES project list as well as assisting them in some counterparty and credit scoring work related to EES's mass marketing effort.

PortRAC ENHANCEMENTS - We have completed the executive demos with very positive comments about the functionality of the system.  Some of them (including Louise Kitchen) commented that they missed their hard copy snapshots so we are enhancing PortRAC to make it easier to print an entire snapshot book for a business unit with the "push of a button".

If you have any other "big" projects that you want us to tackle, please let me know.   Thanks,     Rick C.

Hang in there.  Beleive it or not, everyone in the industry I talk with is
pulling for Enron.  I hope the bank deal comes through quickly.

I wonder which beach AF is on right now.

I thought I'd pass this along in case you need a laugh.

s  cc:   Subject: RAC Teams=09


As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams =
that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it exp=
ands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided t=
he names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adj=
usted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but oth=
ers will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional.=
 There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is respons=
ible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you a=
re in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for considera=
tion.

-=09The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the comme=
rcial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
-=09Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heighten=
ed awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
-=09All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
-=09Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitu=
de among the teams.
-=09Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
- =09Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions wi=
ll require more frequent informal meetings.
-=09There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of=
 credit, market risk or our portfolio.
-=09All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offe=
r to help out if needed.
-=09If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
-=09Encourage weak links in team to perform.
-=09Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the busin=
ess unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
-=09If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange=
 it with your supervisor.
-=09Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the =
PRC and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a cat=
alyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately.=20

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

Hi Jule- thought about your comment about Fidelity. You need to get
those checks and monthly statements. Call them and tell them to get that
stuff to you. Don't call the jerk. Call the 800 number. You should
carefully manage your money. It is very important. Love, Dad.

I had a meeting today with Janet Dietrich, Wanda Curry and Sally Beck in connection with the forthcoming "Doorstep" reviews of EES. 

In an attempt to head this off, Wanda'a group had prepared a quick summary of the state of their world. From a risk management standpoint it appears to me that urgent tactical fixes required are as follows:

Characterization and representation of EAM options in the risk system;
Tarriff curves required;
No intra - month books;
J C Penney deal to go in tomorrow;
Inability to track roll - off of MTM value into actual cash paid or received;
Potentially inaccurate credit exposure numbers due to inconsistent counterparty data in their systems

Obviously Janet is very keen to manage expectations in this area, and I think one of the key points is their value at risk, which I think could jump as points 1 to 4 above are tackled.

The heads - up here is that I believe some discretionary VAR may be required shortly.

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick

Hang in there.  Beleive it or not, everyone in the industry I talk with is
pulling for Enron.  I hope the bank deal comes through quickly.

I wonder which beach AF is on right now.

I thought I'd pass this along in case you need a laugh.

We have submitted your request for $30 million of UK Power VAR to the Board for approval. I thought about this issue a lot before doing so because I don't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limit can add to the danger. My understanding is that there is an IT and backoffice effort underway to improve this situation and it needs to have focus to complete. Please keep the pressure on over there to get the infrastructure where it needs to be. Thanks, Rick

All, 

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the matrix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only one name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - only person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly responsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed processes for capturing value (trade books, structured deals, hard assets and business sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names to be utilized for future e-mails.

Regards, 

Jim

I think we do not need Board Approval, but they should be notified at the next meeting. I believe I discussed this with Pug and that is what we concluded. Therefore, we need a new DASH and a quick summary of transaction which would include changes from original deal. Rick

Conferring with Gorte, we need a new DASH for the India sale due to 
1) the time since signing (5 months)
2) downward change in purchase price
3) general change in circumstances of Enron
 
In addition to updating the numbers (as we discussed this morning), we should include
an ownership structure diagram and a legal risk memo concerning what bankruptcy 
related approvals are required (if any).
 
Whether or not Board approval is required is possibly an open issue. We will research.

I will think about it. We are achieving the correct outcome here but the timing is off. Concentrate on Caulfield and Oman. Get Brown involved to make sure we get those guys. Use Ene options as a currency to entice them. Upside much better than Chase/JP. Just a thought. Rick

I am obviously at pretty close to an all-time low in my most recent career  at Enron. I need to talk to you about where this is going. I would appreciate it if you would think about this over the weekend and I will schedule some time to discuss with you next week.

Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)

Thanks, Rick Buy

Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

	Please call with any questions or comments.

Thanks

Subject:	Credit Insurance Claim for PG&E

Rick/Ben/Rick,

We need to decide whether we want to make a claim under our Portfolio Credit Insurance policy for the Pacific Gas & Electric Company financial swaps claim (approximately $74mm).  The policy gives us 30 days from the date of the bankruptcy to give notice of the claim.  The deadline is May 6, 2001.

It is not anticipated that any claim will mitigate any income loss as the portfolio credit reserve will increase by a similar amount to our claim.  All benefits from the insurance have already been recognized from previous releases from the portfolio credit reserve.  All recoveries in bankruptcy will passed to the insurance underwriters if we decide to make the claim.

Please advise of your thoughts or if it would be helpful to set up a meeting to discuss in more detail.

Regards,
Bill

I had my weekly update meeting with my team on metals and was quite encouraged by the report. Seems like real good progress on all fronts. As400 systems work, var implementation and trading results all seemed positive. Some issues around SAP/AS400 reconciliation but recognized.

Metals was one of my biggest worries but has slipped way down the list. Great work to your team.

Subject:	DASH Classification - "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments"

As we discussed yesterday, in our review of our DASH recommendation vs. actual performance we found 36 DASHes that have been approved since late 1999 that carry the recommendation "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments".  Typically the RAC Comments describe substantial issues that must be resolved if the transaction is to be successful.

Given RAC's increased visability and accountability for portfolio performance, perhaps a more forceful description than "See Other RAC Comments" would be desirable which could be  something like: 

		"Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" 

Therefore, the four DASH categories would be as follows:

	___  Proceed with Transaction

	____ Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required

	____ Returns Below Capital Price

	____ Do Not Proceed

The "See other RAC Comments" could be used as a footnote with an asterisk placed on any of the above categories where we wanted to call the reader's attention to our comment section.  We would, however, eliminate "See other RAC Comments"  as an official DASH classification category.  

Please let me know what you think.  We can instantly make this change or any variation you would like in both the DASH Template and Library.

Teresa and I spoke with Sharon Butcher today who recommended that the potential sale of E&P portfolio should be described and approved at this preliminary stage by Lavorato, Haedicke, Goerte, and Lay et al per policy regarding conflicts. A DASH would follow when the deal gets further along. The issue here is John Thompson and other employees potentially "negotiating a deal" which would include their getting equity in the company which purchases assets. Donna and I just spoke and our thoughts are that the deal description currently in draft form would be circulated with an approval cover sheet explaining the reason for the approval sought.

FYI - Teresa and  I are meeting with the HR rep and the Enron employment attorney this aft and then all with John so that he understands what process should be followed re the employees - ie his communications with them and with potential purchasers. NAncy

Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

Rick:

Did you get the articles that I sent to you on the fleet card business?  If you have some time, I'd like to discuss the meeting that we had with Comdata (which has a 60% market share of the fleet card business).  They have some live data that potentially could be very interesting (see following article).

Comdata is a quasi-credit card company as well as payment and services company.  In their normal course of business, they extend various credit lines to companies that operate fleets and they provide factoring services as well.  Comdata processes about 350 million transactions per year, of which about half represent diesel sales of about $15 billion annually.  They are also one of the largest issuers of stored value cards (GAP, etc.)

Are you making any progress on the credit side?

Take care.

Shawn

Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings shortfalls, layoffs loom 
If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nation's economic recovery, pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they haven't seen this slow a first quarter in a decade. 
"Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a public company in 1990," Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO Jerry Moyes said. 
The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year. 
Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected late in the third quarter last year and has become "more pronounced in each successive quarter." March, he said, has been "as disappointing as the first two months this year." 
Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls that will cause them to miss analysts' first-quarter estimates. But there are deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small, family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years ago. 
Swift's volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone. 
"We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago," said Bob Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. "The slowdown in manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off." 
Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the year-ago period. Con-Way's tonnage declines were estimated in the "mid-single-digit" percentage range. 
Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see sidebar) 
Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportation's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year. 
"January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. It's coming back in March. We're probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. We're picking back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the year, we'd have said we'd be up double-digits," Hanley said. 
The national economic picture is "a big concern," Hanley said. "We're not seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. We're seeing customers ship 10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly we're concerned. We'll do O.K., but not as great as we'd like." 
Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's world. The genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown. 
To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner. It's going to be awhile before it's filet mignon time again. 
Shippers see what's happening as well but say it's still too early in the year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks. 
"All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business levels -- definitely slower than early last year," said Bill Huie, assistant vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas. "With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement." 
The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. "Our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter," said Roger Dick, spokesman for Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight, Duluth, Ga. 
USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nation's "serious economic slowdown," said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall "very substantially below" current Wall Street consensus. 
Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added. 
"Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being the strongest month of the period," Skinner said in a statement. "This year, the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months." 
It's not just the LTL industry that's hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand. 
"So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply," Valentine wrote in his most recent "Trucking Snapshot" for early March. 
Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was "masked by the strong economy," Valentine says. 
In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts. 
The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months. Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a "two-for-one" sale on three- to five-year-old Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand new Chevy Suburban SUV. 
What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a 100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets. 
The glut may last for a while, according to Valentine's analysis. Assuming a three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year. That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy. 
"We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these factors, we expect USFreightways' profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts' forecasts," Skinner said. 
In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle, rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies, Skinner added. 
Expectations at each of USF's operating companies have been affected, some more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year, Skinner said. 
Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be "accelerated" in the wake of the softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said. 
"We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further impeding progress in this area," Skinner said. "During the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force. These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions." 
In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time, that was USF's 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned $23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

WTI oil            OPEC recently agreed to reduce supply by 5% and
                   has stated a price objective of $25 per barrel.
Capacity           Retail sales of Class 8 tractors (new trucks
                   entering the market) came down in January, but
                   inventory (trucks that will enter the market at some 
                   point) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3.4 months

Retail sales       Retail sales rose 0.7% in January. While this
                   was better than forecast, the upside was likely
                   the result of excessive clearance sales after a
                   disappointing holiday season.
Consumer           The Conference Board's measure of consumer
confidence         confidence fell again (nine points) in February

Market             Implications
MSDW [*] truckload Negative for all TL carriers.
freight index
Diesel prices      The downward trend is Positive for all
                   carriers, especially TL carriers, which have
                   greater exposure to fuel than LTL carriers.
WTI oil            Negative for all carriers, as $25 per
                   barrel is still 25% higher than the $20 per
                   barrel average since 1990.

As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the process of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.  If you wish to have separate representation, please let me know.  I cannot guarantee that the D&O carrier will reimburse you for the cost of separate counsel.  

I am setting up a meeting with counsel for Enron Corp., Susman & Godfrey, to discuss this litigation with you as soon as possible.  Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions.

Thank you.

Subject:	Remote Offices- Suggestions

Dan, in response to the following memo, can you discuss with Rick his ideas.  I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office, its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which should be modified.  Given the latest redeployments and terminations the field offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.  This is consistent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.  If you could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate.

Good job on handling the "5's".

Delainey

Subject:	Remote Offices- Suggestions

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick

Dave,

As I left on your voicemail, I would like to discuss RAC support for Enron Principal Investments.  This is really broken down into two components:  1) the current portfolio, and 2) new investments.  For now, I am most concerned about the current portfolio.  There are over 80 investments in the portfolio for which we are now responsible.  These range from a $120 million investment in publicly traded ADR's of COPEL (a Brazilian utility) to a $150,000 investment in the Creole Shack (a local Houston restaurant).  I assume that most of these positions already have a designated underwriter to the deal.

Also, I would like to have a full day review session with you, and the relevant members of your group, to discuss lessons learned from past investments and the strategy of our group going forward.  My assistant will contact you to set this up (hopefully sometime in late July).

I appreciate your help in these matters.

Thanks,

KG

ons


I just wanted to take a moment to personally invite each of you to particip=
ate in the e-Speak session this Thursday, May 10 at 10:00 am (CDT).  If you=
 have questions that you'd like to submit in advance, you can do so by visi=
ting e-Speak on the Enron homepage.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on wha=
t's happening within the Program.  Since assuming my new role at the beginn=
ing of April, I've been focusing my efforts on meeting with Enron's busines=
s unit leaders, and with as many Analysts and Associates as possible.  Thes=
e activities underscore my priorities in managing the Program - a very stro=
ng alignment with Enron's businesses, and frequent / informal communication=
.

Some of the specific items that we're focused on as a result of your feedba=
ck, and that will be communicated in coming weeks include:
improvements to the PRC process which are in the final stages of developmen=
t with the business units,
recruiting goals and strategies for the 2001 recruiting season,
a series of floor meetings beginning today to visit informally with partici=
pants in the Program,
an updated social schedule that places a priority on interaction among Anal=
ysts and Associates, as well as with the business leaders of Enron.

I'm excited that Traci Warner and Ted Bland have joined our team in the Wes=
tern Hemisphere to lead Recruiting and Career Development respectively.  To=
gether, they bring almost 20 years of Enron business unit experience, and i=
n the case of Traci - experience as an Associate in the Program.  Anna Jans=
son continues to do an outstanding job leading the Eastern Hemisphere Progr=
am, and has been an great source of new ideas. =20

When I joined Enron in 1992, there were about 25 Analysts and Associates co=
mbined, sitting in one group on the 30th floor.  Today, we have over 700 fu=
ture Innovators and Leaders of Enron in offices around the world.  This Pro=
gram has been, and will continue to be our most important source of new tal=
ent.  I'm very proud to have been asked to take this role, and I look forwa=
rd to working with each of you.

Since my daughter is going over to London it prompted me to see if that would be a good time for me to come as well. Then week of March 5. I could stay a day or two if needed. Any thoughts? Rick

I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap. I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement. If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issues I will proceed. Thanks, Rick

I need to discuss this deal with you...it is essentially a physical option to supply steel to a very large service center with locations in the US and in Europe.  The challenge for you guys will be that it will require a $30mil option payment to them.  Very good deal without credit issues...pls call me when you have a chance.

Simon

I have run an indicative credit reserve which comes out at $15m.

It should be made clear at this stage the number is only indicative and subject to further change and discussion.  Forward price curves and volatilities will need to be confirmed, as will the option structure.

We still want to achieve the best possible contractual terms through pursuing collateral rights and should consider other risk-mitigating options such as bankruptcy protection.  The tenor and $ exposure would warrant sign-off at a very senior level, and will obviously be covered by the DASH approval.

The deal is clearly of great value to Enron, but we should question the motives of Balli in wanting or needing to do this.  How much do we know about their exisiting banking relationships and ability to access funding at present?

I'm sure we will discuss further.

Paul

Ted

Bruce Garner has asked me to bring you into a trade we're looking at with Balli-Klockner (BK). Ken Curry was asked to evaluate a related proposal a week back but is now on holiday and Rebecca Phillips was not brought up to speed. This latest proposal would be a European trade and the client is under time constraints and keen to move fast.

The transaction is as follows:

Enron has the right to sell to BK physical Hot Rolled Coil steel at Index (CRU HRC) + 7.5% 

Start:  Jan2002

End:    Dec2016

Tonnage:        500 000 Metric Tonnes per annum (total tonnage: 7.5 million MT)

Enron pays a premium of 30 million USD upon contracting.

The CRU Index is Enron's benchmark steel index and physical steel trades at Index flat. There is thus 7.5% intrinsic value in the puts which translates to approx. $75 million USD in present value terms ($45million net of premium).

Our counterparty would be the parent of the soon to be combined Balli Klockner PLC and the various Balli service centres soon to be merged (BK Holdings Ltd UK). BK are not offering us additional credit relief, ie. bank guarantees, LC's, insurance bonds, etc. Your help in establishing our appetite and an appropriate credit charge for this transaction would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

Simon Cose

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

I attend a regular meeting with AA and Rick Causey discussing EES internal controls. They have asked for a detailed presentation on :

-EAM business
-Tariff curve summary and positions against those curves
-Credit issues in general.

I will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and get it organized. EES may attend but not present. I think we should give them an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the above areas. Probably a one hour mtg but maybe two. Lets try to meet next week. 

Karen- please set up.

Subject:	New Legal Team to Assist RAC

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Rick,

This email was supposed to be delivered the week after the Happy Hour. Something went wrong and it never got delivered. I still want you and Karen to read it. 

Rick,

Thank you for inviting us to the Happy Hour last week. As always these events help us to break the silos in which we tend to work some 
times. In this occasion I made two new friends and had the opportunity to discuss business maters with the people that work in Rick Carson group. After finishing the 3-Quarter revaluation process, I feel that Underwriting and Due Diligence can work much more closer, shearing information and experiences from the Due diligence site visits.  

Happy boss day

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding manual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediately in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the correct net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant Energy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  This resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.  

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.  

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,

Dear Enron's topmanagement,
We are not only concerned on the crashed stock but also Enron's
situation in Japan. The business here is too difficult!!!
How do you know the current situation here:

  > Bad Reputation in Japan - if you say you are from Enron people will say 
"No"
  > Ignorance of Japanese Business - wasting many time on TOCOM, a market
    controlled by mafia, those minor comnies want to cheat Enron's money
  > Unsatisfactory business environment - deregulation will not proceed in 
three
    years
  > Poor manegment - the office is like a kindergarden, the so called 
"experts"
    have serious discrimmination with local staff; They do nothing 
themselves just
    ask the local "slave" to work hard and they go to vacation or business 
trip
  > "Sato" means sweet in Japanese but Sato Project is not so sweet as you 
think!
    Have you expected another "E-power"?

I have to say we are so dispointed with Enron!!!! Enron Japan is at the 
entrance
of "Bermuda Triangle", we worry when will it dispear?

Sato
Enron Japan

Just between you and I, I think there may be an issue here of a couple personalities. We can't have that in your group or mine. I'll watch carefully.

On the subject of timing, we should probably have a standard to shoot for. Time to read contract, run model, review results and communicate. I'll talk to Bill about this.

On the issue of the hotline, we do not have everyone trained in running models for EES deals. We are working on getting more people up to speed. Thanks,  Rick

Hey guys, I know we're all drinking from a firehouse here, but we've got to figure out how to streamline some of our processes.  I hear it's still taking way too long to get our credit reserve numbers (i.e.- IBM- 2 1/2 days) and it really is effecting our dealflow. People know about the credit hot line # but the consistent response is that the individuals that pick up this # are of varying experience levels and they still have to clear everything through Denise anyway. Please help me on this.

Also, we have to verify our process around incorporating an evaluation on an accounts receivable (late payment) for a customer when doing a credit check. Who is responsible for this now and how does this work within ENA for example?

Let's talk on Monday. Thanks.

Rick,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding our Korean Won exposure.  As you know, a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges Corp or business unit.   

The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today.  They mentioned that it is an appropriate time to put a currency hedge in place for 3 reasons:

1.) The spot rate has fallen back to the 1230 KRW/USD level
2.) The forward rate is relatively flat as there is no signifcant difference in 1 year rates between the two currencies.
3.) Option volatilities have decreased significantly over the past month.

Please let me know if (when?) we should discuss this issue further.  The currency traders mentioned that they will bubble this issue up with Jim Hughes again later today.  

Thanks,

Rudi

Subject:	RE: FYI - Project Raven

I spoke briefly yesterday with Brad Richter who was going to put something more formal together.  I will send that to you when I have it.

Jeff and the commercial team had different opinions about the managed hosting side of the business.  Part of EBS liked the technical capabilitiy of PSI Net and felt that this capability would allow EBS to run a managed hosting business (basically outsourcing the operation of company web sites).  Jeff did not like this business and had told EBS last week to not put any growth on this part of the business in their analysis.  

Without growth on the managed hosting part of the business, EBS needed to find $100 million/year of benefit through the acquisition.  A large part of this would have come from IP Transit which, due to its size, PSI Net would have received free through peering and which EBS currently pays for.  These saving depend a lot on hockey stick projections from EBS' current activities (although MSN would provide a large portion of this savings).  The rest of the benefit was to come through cross selling PSI Net's existing customers and new customers obtained due to the combination of their technical capability and Enron's financial capability.  This increased technical capability is diametrically opposed to Project Reset (the sale of EBS' long haul network to Qwest in return for a series of options on capacity).

PSI Net wanted a quick decision and a purchase of the whole company through a packaged bankruptcy to try and maintain staff and customers.  I have heard comments that they wanted Enron to purchase their consulting arm as well.  This group had approximately 1,000 people and held no particular interest to EBS.  I do not know whether it was the speed of the transaction, the consulting arm, the managed hosting business, or the increased technical direction that killed the transaction.

Hi Jule- thought about your comment about Fidelity. You need to get those checks and monthly statements. Call them and tell them to get that stuff to you. Don't call the jerk. Call the 800 number. You should carefully manage your money. It is very important. Love, Dad.

Subject:	JEDI II


The CalPERS board voted on Monday, June 18th to appoint a delegation, to be headed by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, to meet with chief executive officers of various energy companies (including Enron) to discuss with them CalPERS' concerns.  This action is a direct result of the continuing power crisis in California and the threat of a backlash which could lead to re-regulation of the energy industry in California, which could in turn hurt the long-term value of CalPERS' energy holdings.  CalPERS owns 2.6 million shares of Enron - less that 1/10th of 1% of the total value of CalPERS' assets and 6.2% of their total energy holdings. 

As a result of these actions, Enron and CalPERS halted their negotiations of the amendments to the JEDI II Partnership Agreement which would have expanded the investment opportunities available to JEDI II and thus funds available to various Enron business units (i.e. EBS).  Instead the partners agreed to a one year extension of the commitment period for Capital Contributions (limited to $100 million) under current Partnership Agreement terms and concurrently called a Suspension Event effective June 29, 2001.

What does this mean?  A Suspension Event prohibits any new investments being made by the JEDI II Partnership until the Suspension Event period is lifted.  We are uncertain at this point when that might be.  

I have attached below some press releases related to the issue.

If you have any questions or concerns please give me a call.

I think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, although the economy is suffering at the moment. It does not sound like this lady has her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You should talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached. Don't worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot. You could work for companies like Enron, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major. My guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this. The first stop should be the head of the department. Lets talk more on this topic. Love, Dad

Hey dad.  Just wanted to let you know that I went into my undergraduate career services office today (just for the heck of it).  The lady was very helpful but sort of scared me.  At first she was snobby because I hadn't had any experience, but then she realized that I had a lot of skills from my courses that would go on my resume and that I could include my Nantucket work and stuff like that.  No chance of a job in England or Ireland though.  She said it would be too much work for her to start researching foreign companies.  So I guess I'm gonna have to start going to seminars and stuff to get myself ready for job searching.  She's gonna help me with my resume, which I'll proably start on this weekend.  She said summer co-ops are very hard to come by since more kids are looking and companies don't really want people for just the summer.  But she said I'm lucky that I came in so early.!  So who knows.   

I also applied for engineering dean's host today.  The application process was easy, and it kind of hurt my pride when I applied for CAS dean's host and didn't get it, so I'll see if this goes any better.  It will just entail a few hours on Fridays in the spring, and I remember that we both found the dean's hosts very helpful when we went to my freshman Friday.  But I may not get it, so oh well.  Rebecca has not woken up yet today.  It is 5:00.  She says she has a headache.  It has been nice and quiet at least.  I returned a textbook today (went and made copies of the pages i needed to save us the 35 bucks).  I accept cash or check.  Life is good and boring.  I have been very productive the past few days, and I am happy the week is coming to an end.  I will try to have some fun this weekend.  OK that's it for now.  HOpe all's well for you.  Write or call if you're bored/depressed.  Later skat! er. 

Cheers big ears, 
Jules

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster

+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter

What if it were $20MM? Skilling will definitely ask why such a large increase so I need to have your full support. Rick

So noted. Watch is a defined term in our system but doesn't mean you don't "watch" everything else. So long, and may all your investments remain "performing". Rick

For future reference, please note that all of our investments are "on watch" all of the time.  Any concept to the contrary seems absurd.

I know you guys are all very busy right now, but we are trying to move forward on the Doorstep activities.

Last I heard you and Rick Causey definitely wanted us to do the London ones.

Any help you can provide in terms of finding a RAC resource to help on this on  would be appreciated.

Dear Ted,

We are all set for the metals doorstep to be performed the week of Nov. 5th with the exception of a name for the RAC resource.  We are starting to plan the review and would like to involve RAC.  Who have you designated as the RAC resource (Brenda Herod from Operations will be the person responsible from the operations side)?  

I'd like to get Brenda and RAC together some time this week if possible.

Thanks!

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK

Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign focuses on making a difference to people severely impacted by the recent flood "Allison".  All business units and Corporate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the following United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Centers, and Center for the Retarded.  The Corporate functions and EGAS employees' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming with the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals-on-wheels beneficiaries.  Activities that will be completed that day include painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs.

The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regardless of religious orientation.  These services include: childcare, youth development, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elderly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refugee services and other community services.  The Jewish Community Center is responsible for providing approximately 40% of Houston/Harris County meals-on-wheels per day.  Funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs, the United Way and individuals.

I encourage every single employee  to take at least half of your day on August 8th to participate in this effort.  RAC's goal is 100% participation.  It is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community.  

Below are our United Way contacts within each group that will be helping with this process and can answer any questions.  Please sign up with your team leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full day, or for which half of the day, and they will review with each function's department head to ensure appropriate RAC coverage for that day's responsibilities.  

Thank you in advance for volunteering your time.  Let's show everyone that RAC is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate.

Rick

Gentlemen:

	Bob and I would like to schedule a joint session of the Audit and Finance
Committees, perhaps at the August meeting, to cover the following topics
(and any others which occur to you):

1.	how and why are the trading and investment policies (and levels specified
therein) established;

2.	how and why are the VAR and maximum expected loss limits set;

3.	how useful is the VAR methodology as it is extended outside of the
wholesale gas and electricity business.

	It would also be useful to update the Committees on the post-audits of
recent investments and perhaps on the larger "asset" investments such as
Dabhol, Electrol, Cuiaba, etc.  Even as we move away from these investments,
there may be some additional lessons to be learned.  Does our post-audit
process and procedure continue?

	We could meet briefly in May to discuss the idea of a joint meeting and the
proposed agenda, if that is convenient.

	Best regards.

Ted Murphy is chasing me up for answers on his corp allocations.  Can you provide any detail to the April allocations and why they might be more than budget?
 
The 2001 Corp allocations budget shows your name as the contact point for RAC, if this is not correct could you please provide a new contact name.  
 
Thanks in advance,

From the Seattle Times
(seattletimes.com)

Energy costs soak City Light
by Jim Brunner <mailto:jbrunner@seattletimes.com>
Seattle Times staff reporter
Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the market in
March, more than any month in its 91-year history.
City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and
businesses eclipsed the previous records - $84 million set in February and
nearly $80 million in January.
To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the
utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. "We're
spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are
staggering," said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.
It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less
water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to
purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented
levels.
Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most
of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are
profiting enormously from the energy crunch.
Last month alone, the bill from Enron, a Houston-based corporation, was
$25.5 million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's
Sempra Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light.
City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its
load from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on
the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its
power costs.
Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City
Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the
Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines.
In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for
energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're
saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to
generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to
surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour.
"We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding
cutting off our head later," said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman.
Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate
increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way.
Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and
Spokane.
Meanwhile, Enron's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion.
Its stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year
before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week.
"It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like
Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and
businesses," said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's
Energy and Environmental Policy Committee.
"There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the
shareholders of these companies," Wills said.
Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to
encourage the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation.
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for
selling power at prices dictated by the free market. "Enron is providing
electricity to a market that needs it," Denne said. "It's unfortunate when
regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a
problem of supply and demand."
The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and
is one of the top "soft money" donors to political campaigns. Enron and its
executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans
last year, according to Common Cause.
Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to
Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns.
Enron doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes
money as a middleman - buying power from utilities and then reselling it for
a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline
companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North
America.
Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use
of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book
online. You just point, click and spend.
"It's easier than Amazon," said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City
Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power
"products" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers.
Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs
and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next
hour, next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available,
but it's clearly a sellers' market.
Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for
more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a
megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up.
"This is pure profit," said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.
There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder
than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling
the power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities
are paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of
wholesale power.
However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices.
In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month
were to neighbors.
Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged
City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per
megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates.
Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281.
That compares with Enron's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an
overall average of $194.
The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour.
City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power
delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher
depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with
the BPA.
Despite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better
shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1
Seattle's "energy independence day" because that's when the city will begin
receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA.
The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired
power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the
open market, city officials say.
But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may
have to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council
has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers
although it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average
person.
Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good
long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed,
the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded.
Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City
Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to
Texas.

Bill- there is no issue with the garage as yet. Subsidy is still in place and bills are being paid per Steve Kean and Steve Woods. If you want to move to new garage it probably can be arranged. Let me know and I can get the person to get it started for you and anyone else. I think there is plenty of parking available. Rick

Please find attached an EIM report on our prospective counterparty(ies) on the Balli-Klockner $40m steel prepay.  We received this report from EIM after informing them that we would require a background check by Lynn's team before proceeding.  

Apparently, Enron closed a deal in the US earlier this year with WeBco which is a joint venture between Balli Group and Wierton Steel.  The commercial team is arguing that RAC and others must have investigated the allegations below at the time, but obviously felt comfortable enough to let the deal proceed.  

I believe that Ted is planning to give you a call on this to discuss.

Dear Greg,

Attached is an update to my initial report on Balli Group and the Alaghband family.  

I have obtained a copy of the 1994 House of Representatives report referenced in the March 1999 Der Spiegel article I noted in my initial report.  This House report contains derogatory allegations about the Alaghband family and their business practices -- the relevant section is included in the attached update.  Sources note that the author of the report was known for "sensational" writing on topics difficult to verify.

I have also included excerpts of an interview with another source -- an Iranian businessman based in London who is a close personal and professional contact of the Alaghband family.  His comments are positive, barring Vahid Alaghband's alleged tendency to hold bills, and provide some additional information on the family and their  associations.  

I believe this wraps up all outstanding inquiries on this matter.  Please let me know if you have questions or areas for additional inquiry.

Best regards,

Kimberly

Bjorn:

Many thanks for your role in yesterday's meeting with Borden Chemical.  It was most appropriate for you to follow-up with Ed and Bob, and skillfully stick-handle the opportunity in the adept manner you did.  As we discussed, it's hard to guess what direction the company will choose to take going forward, but I believe we gave it a good shot.  I spoke with Alan, and he will call Ed and/or Bob later in the week to see what their thoughts are, given time for reflection.  If we do not hear back from Bob by mid-next week, I will call him.   

Thank you again,
skb

Someone from Rick Buy's Risk Management group will be calling you to schedule a visit to discuss with your team the procedures and strategy PGE has in place to manage the variability of our net variable power costs.  Since Rick's group is  a corporate Risk Management group there should be no market affiliate issues.  The visit will enable us Houstonians to get even a better handle on the risk profile of your business given the tremendous volatility we have experienced in power prices.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Dear Rick:

Just a quick followup to my voice mail of earlier this afternoon---

I represent an Executive Search Firm based in Atlanta and have been retained by an international leader in the energy industry to pursue Director-level talent; as it happens, my client has recently indicated an express interest in speaking with you.  Since I'd imagine you've been inundated with calls and e-mails similar to mine, in an effort to eliminate any confusion I should tell you that we tried to contact you yesterday (my associate, Michael Allen, left you a voice mail).

I understand that the environment at Enron must be a challenging one at this point; however, if you're interested in talking/listening and are in a position to take a short break, the President/COO of my client company is in Houston today and is curious as to whether you'd by some remote chance be free this afternoon or evening for a brief chat.  I realize that this is highly unorthodox, but also feel that standing on ceremony is perhaps not always the most prudent approach.

I'll wait to hear from you in regard to your interest level---and if you're not available today (as I'm assuming to be the case), we can obviously reschedule for a time that's a bit more reasonable.  Thanks---

Sincerely,

Marcy Brinegar

Thanks for note. I recall our conversation. I've had surgery but as you know the worry is did they get it all? Surface tissue of tongue on bottom right. This is so weird since I don't smoke or dip which are the primary risk factors. Thanks for your concern and I will let you know how this goes. I have found that information control is critical so please don't discuss with anyone. I go back to MDA in a month for follow-up visit (ultra sound of lymph nodes). Rick

Rick - I recently heard you had had surgery at MDA for a malignancy and wanted to send you my very best wishes for a full, complete and fast recovery!  As I think we have talked in the past, I have had a long-term association with MDA for what was an awful tumor (spinal Ewing's sarcoma) which was aggressively and successfully treated there.  In fact, this year, I will celebrate (and I do mean celebrate!) 20 years since diagnosis.  I hope you will have a similar tale to tell many years down the road.  Rick, it there is anything I can do for you as you recuperate or journey through this experience, I hope you will let me know.  In the meantime, please know that lots of friends and associates are praying for you and hoping to see you doing the things you enjoy very soon.  Take care, Rick!  My best, Paula

I just wanted to reiterate my interest in a RAC  rotation, following our conversation last week. I have had a chance to  speak to some analysts in RAC and I am convinced that it would be an  unparalled learning opportunity. Once again, I will be starting in the analyst  program this July, and I am graduating from UT Austin with both  a BBA and MPA. I am also taking the CPA exam this May. Lexi Elliot from HR  should be getting in touch with you following my conversation with her this  morning regarding a RAC rotation. Many thanks once again for your  assistance.

Please circ to all of RAC.


I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

Rick,

Both Tanya and David Port are out of the office today and neither will be able to call in.  In speaking with Tanya this morning, she would like to report on her discussions with Jim Fallon and the EBS Team in London when she returns on Monday.

Given that two key team members are out-of-pocket, I recommend we postpone the RAC EBS Team Meeting until Monday afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any objections or conflicts and I'll confirm or reschedule, as appropriate.

Thanks,

Subject:	Enron Japan - Joe Hirl visit

Rick - 

Joe Hirl is scheduled to visit the Houston office this week and I think he is trying to schedule a meeting with you.  Bill Bradford mentioned that I might want to bring you up to speed on some of the recent developments in that office. Though much of the background information is probably old news for you, there are some issues that might come up in your meeting.

As you know, Enron Japan has made the move from Power to Global Markets.  To date, Enron Japan has not submitted proposals for new  VaR limits or products, but I believe their meetings with the Houston management this week are to determine such.  I think by the end of the week, they will have a better idea of what exactly they will trade, what limits they will want trade under, the systems they will need to implement, etc.  

Last week, the commercial team discussed with me the possibilities of trading petrochemicals through  a new exchange - The Tokyo Commodities Exchange.  To jumpstart the Global Markets business, the team intends to be quite active on the exchange, trading Gasoline and Kerosene.

From a Credit perspective, we need to get a better idea of how transactions in the exchange will be managed.  The exchange is unusual in that there is not a clearinghouse.  Rather, any order we post will be matched to a specific counterparty, which could be any of 80 or so "Broker Members".  Credit risk is somewhat mitigated in that each counterparty in every trade must post an initial margin amount to be held and used to reduce default risk.  However, as far as I can tell, there will be no incremental margin call when exposure increases beyond the initial margin amount.  This has the potential of opening Enron to significant counterparty risk with counterparties with whom we might not necessarily be comfortable.  The information packet I received does vaguely discuss a "Protection Fund" that might mitigate default risk.  I will follow-up on this issue, but for now, protection is unclear.

From a market risk perspective, I will make sure the team has the appropriate approvals in place for VaR limits and products to be traded prior to transacting.  I will also make sure the right systems are in place to capture transactions, volumes, etc. - and have these aggregate into the daily RiskTrac reports.

From an Underwriting perspective, there seems to be one transaction that is worth mentioning (others are still in preliminary stages).  Jeremy Thirsk is working on a large ($40-50MM) Methanol prepay agreement with Nissho Iwai - a struggling Japanese counterparty.  Though the DASH is still being drafted, it is worth noting that this transaction not only carries significant counterparty credit risk, but the methanol purchases will take place in Indonesia  - adding operating and country risks into the equation.  Jeremy and I discussed various actions we could take to mitigate risks  - taking liens on assets, credit default swaps, insurance, and corporate supply obligation agreements.   I have not heard back from Jeremy this week, but thought you might need to know this is out there in case it comes up in your meeting with Hirl. 

The commercial team in the process of shifting gears right now, and I am not sure how long it will take for them to have things in order enough to transact.  I will keep everyone posted on their progress. Please let me know if you would like to see anything in further detail.

Dear Robert Brooks:

Subject: Risk Management Policy Mandatory Certification

On August 14, 2001, the Board of Directors of Enron Corp. (the "Board") app=
roved a new and revised Enron Risk Management Policy (the "Policy").  The B=
oard amended the Policy on October 9, 2001.  The Policy covers Enron Corp. =
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") and focuses on procedures for managing=
 the Company's exposure to risk as encountered in the normal course of busi=
ness.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposu=
re to risk will be evaluated, managed and controlled and pursuant to which =
capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy also focuses on four m=
ajor types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk =
and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks will be managed on a portfolio=
 basis with standard transactions being subject to various market risk limi=
t structures and credit approval processes and non-standard transactions be=
ing subject to the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval =
Process.   Finally, the Policy provides an overview of the various risk mea=
surement tools and limits that will be applied to risk, and the roles and r=
esponsibilities of both key participants and normal employees in the risk m=
anagement framework. =20

All managers and relevant employees of the Company are responsible for comp=
lying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in the Pol=

Subject: PGE Trading Limits


Rick,
 
I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .
 
1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.
 
2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
 
If you agree with these changes please let me know.  If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.
 
Thanks.

I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational issues as well. 

I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

Just to be sure you're in the loop here, no one in Finance was available to sign this DASH last week. Not Fastow, not Glisan, their Assistants weren't in. Deffner wasn't here. Lipshutz wasn't here. etc, etc, etc. I told Hatchen, Gorte to represent Corp. Finance and Gorte gave verbal OK. We still haven't been able to get Fastow and Glisan to sign the DASH (I think they're back tomorrow). Deal is done and executed.

This is too difficult for someone in our Deal Management group to facilitate through our system. Maybe we need to give back-up authority to RAC for approvals in a situation like this. This may be a topic for our offsite on Friday.

Rick/Vince,

Should this not be a Credit/Research initiative while the business unit focuses on originating good economic transactions?  Not to be complaining, but shouldn't EES be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste resources on a project we are already moving forward on?  You can't run a portfolio model, unless you have deals in a risk system!  How complex do we want these MODELS to be?  Behavioral implications on credit default?  They still don't seem to understand.

Regards,
Bill


Mark - please attend.  You may want to include Martin to help EES understand the complexity of their deals.

Subject:	Credit Risk Model Comments - at this point.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back. 

1)	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.

2)	The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credit rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3)	Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward's where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental for a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4)	A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I mean that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't. This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn't consider. This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5)	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If we can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6)	A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments. Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enron's aggregate credit risk?

7)	There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improved" analysis could make the credit risk be higher.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- 

(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  

        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     
(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. 

Happy New Year 

Louise

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

The Extreme VaR functionality is now operational on the RaC website.  The testing phase is completed, but ongoing calibration and fine-tuning will continue.  Extreme VaR represents a complement to Regular VaR, but concentrates on the Extreme Tail regions.  The default shown on the screen is at 99.7%.

David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so the allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to come. Rick

As per our discussion last week, Sally will get with you and review the closing of the books that occurs each night.  This is in reference to the issue of which of the approximately 1200 books get closed easily and which ones require some miracles.  The goal is to better understand the issues at the commodity and/or business unit level.

Dear Mr Buy,

I have tried on a number of occasions to get hold of you by telephone, but
have now been advised by one of your colleagues to send an email instead.

Briefly, I work for a company here in London called RK Analytics which
undertakes consulting projects for clients in the financial arena.

In this instance, my client is a major player in commodity-related risk
management products.  My client is hoping to determine how it can better
improve the service it offers to entities such as Enron, and in order to do
this it has commissioned my services to conduct interviews with a number of
its clients (or potential clients).

To date, we've been lucky enough to have the cooperation of everyone we've
approached and I was therefore hoping that you yourself might be prepared to
answer some questions for me (bearing in mind that your answers would be
treated in confidence).

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
Otherwise, I attach herewith a questionnaire and would be most grateful if
we could find an opportunity to discuss this further over the next days.

I appreciate your time and consideration,

Kind regards,

Naomi Driver

Rick,
 
I'd like to introduce you to our company and set-up a one-hourconference call and discussion with you and/or someone you trustto evaluate this opportunity.
iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science Department at California Institute of Technology.
iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to those composite events  based on business rules.
iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  application and data source, to enable new business processes. 
For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  Application Framework? to  detect and react to interdependent market events. This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to relevant dynamic events in  their Market Intelligence information environment. 
The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness applications over last several years has established the  need and created the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta Applications. 
Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.
Thanks,
H. Enzo Olfati 
Account Manager

tel.978.461.4840 direct.510.302.6767
P.S. I have also  e-mailed this to others at Enron to determine the appropriate contacts  to have the discussion  with.

Subject:	ICE Program - UVa - DASH

Good morning Rick,

Christie Patrick suggested that I contact you for assistance in pulling together a 'dummy' DASH and past deal capital budgeting information.  Enron University Affairs, the Xcelerator and the Recruiting department are collaborating with the McIntire School of Commerce (University of Virginia) on a year long project where 80 Commerce students will research a topic assigned to them by Enron.  At this point, the Xcelerator has suggested research on the 'Decentralization of Energy Distribution/Distributive Generation', and to this end, we are responding to faculty requests for broad-based industry and Enron-specific information.  Bob Kemp, Associate Dean for the Graduate Programs has requested any type of capital budgeting information that we could provide to help the students 'get a better feel for' how Enron structures its deals.  

I am by no means a financial guru or whiz, so I'm not sure any of this will make sense to you but here are the buzz words he mentioned during a conference call:

cash flows
$ required needed
cost of capital
time adjustments (for capital)

Is there anything else we can give them (outside of a dummy DASH)?  We will be entering in a CA with the school/students.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Regards,

Cindy
Enron University Affairs

Subject:	Get Better!

Rick,
The reports I am getting regarding you are quite encouraging.  Hope you continue to make progress without too much pain.  Don't talk unless you have to.  Could you imagine if I ever have that operation, there'd be blood everywhere!

I do not have anything in particular that would compel me to make you talk.  It is good to hear that you will be back in the office, because I am concerned that the Board stuff needs direction.  Not that people aren't working on stuff, but your perspective is needed.  We had what I think was an excellent meeting with Jeff Skilling - I chimed in by conference call.  He spent about an hour and 1/2 with David, Cassandra and me.  Had some interesting perspectives.  He did make the comment that, if he could get the same returns on incremental VaR, he would rather increase our limit to $250MM than do more of those asset deals!!

Things are generally the same around here, there are some deals, but none that would require you to step in.    Michael is trying to push to get some things closed in July because he is concerned that August will be dead.  It looks very likely that we are trying to dress up Encom for sale without making big commitments. 
There have been a few problems that may come across your radar scope - there were some personell issues in the Henry Bath warehousing business that have been dealt with and some personell changes in metals, basically a few people let go in NY and London and a re-configuration of the commercial staff - merging of physical and financial.
It seems to be moving on the right track from a control perspective.  It remains to be seen on the commercial front.  EBS has gotten gutted here.  I have spoken to Steve.  Apparently, he is going back soon, but he is in the fortunate state of having a few decent offers to weigh internally. He hasn't told me his final decision.

We have lost a 2 more people to resignation on the credit side - Anna Reich and Karolina Moran.  I would have liked to have kept Karolina but she has been here 2 years and seems a little too bitter from the management changes and the lack of substantive change to refresh herself.  Anna was going to have to be replaced anyway.
On the positive side of the ledger, an ex-JP morgan ISDA Collateral Annex expert - Christine Stanchus - has joined yesterday, Pat Cini has been doing a good job, Rudi Z. plans to start on 8/15, Tracy Ngo is here looking around and thinking about early september, 3 from the outside have accepted and we have 4/5 other real prospects. There are also a few other internal transfers (one which we ought to discuss). We have reviewed hundreds of resumes, spoken to tons of agencies, put in 2 newpaper adds and interviewed maybe a hundred people.  Finally, we are starting to see some reasonable quality - a little more expensive, but much better.  Most hires/offers have been in the middle range - sr. Specialist - junior director.  We need to fill in the other ends of the spectrum.  It is possible that we have turned the corner....

I am hoping that when the days begin to get shorter (September 5th?), I will be in a position to actually start to make an impact around here.

Take care and let me know if there is anything personal or professional that I can do to reduce your stress.

Ted

Thanks for the feedback. I sent my best guy there so I hope there is improvement. We have been talking to a candidate for credit that Ted will be discussing with you soon. Hopefully we can make progress there also. I want complete buy in from you and John on this guy before we proceed.

Separately, the scrap metals meeting we had with Causey went well. We will reconvene in two weeks to see where we are.

Thanks again for the feedback. I was a little worried about Ted after the MD disappointment but it seems he has recovered.

Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:

Just to be sure you're in the loop here, no one in Finance was available to sign this DASH last week. Not Fastow, not Glisan, their Assistants weren't in. Deffner wasn't here. Lipshutz wasn't here. etc, etc, etc. I told Hatchen, Gorte to represent Corp. Finance and Gorte gave verbal OK. We still haven't been able to get Fastow and Glisan to sign the DASH (I think they're back tomorrow). Deal is done and executed.

This is too difficult for someone in our Deal Management group to facilitate through our system. Maybe we need to give back-up authority to RAC for approvals in a situation like this. This may be a topic for our offsite on Friday.

We can help you interview. Bradford and Port can really help in this process but its best if you screen them first. As far as dates go we have an Enron BOD mtg coming up which totally consumes us. This meeting is in early May, so after mid April it starts to get crazy. It would be easier for me if you gave me a couple dates and I will see if we can accommodate. Rick

Rick,
I think what would work best is a half to full day in Houston.  Then a month or two later to do a check up.
This will allow us to tell you where we think we are, where we need to be and have you guys think about whether you would suggest anything different. 
Over the next few weeks could you suggest a few times that might work.  

In certain circumstances,  i would like to be able to have someone either w/i your group or perhaps a related group (e.g. kaminski) help in the interview process.  In fact,   I have a few candidates cueing up.  One is a PHD, Art Mazer of CL&P and i would love to be able to throw him past one of your guys.  I was thinking David Port.  Do you think i could borrow him for a phone interview.   I would like to do this asap so any input would be greatly appreciated.  Apparently, this candidate knows a few people w/i Enron and i'd like to run the traps on this  He does not claim that these are great ref's because he worked or knew them in limited capacity but any insight is valuable.   The names of the two people are Art Bieser (apparently worked at Entergy for a short time with him) and Alex Huang who he interviewed for a job at Entergy but choose Enron.  We would need to keep this on a P&C basis. 

I had dinner with Marc Tarkington on Wednesday.  I tried to entice him but its highly unlikely given he is paid quite well and the credit role here is somewhat unique.  He sends his best regards to you.

Thanks,
Bill

Sally- got your voice mail as well. Don't want to create more meetings. Just had a total of three market risk people quit or transfer and each one said one of the considerations was they spent so much time on operational issues that they weren't developing as they should analyzing portfolio risk. I think it might be best if we have a meeting or two and see what issues are identified. It may be better to split in two meetings as you suggested. I need to hear what the nature of the problems are. Some I know like ees, metals, uk power but I think there may be some other fundamental issues that are hindering progress here. No need for you to attend. I will let you know what we come up with including if there are no issues at all! Rick

Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I would like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues".  My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum.   --Sally

I think the daily IT issue meeting has been quite successful in addressing problems in systems and working toward resolution on systems related issues. I would like to expand the scope of this meeting to include daily operational issues as well. 

I plan on restarting my attendance at these meetings on Wednesday. Can the RAC people listed above please make a start at some of the recurring issues.

Thanks, Rick

As with muni bonds, it is nice to be able to just raise taxes to cover your costs. (Unless you are the taxpayer). Tx for update, Rick

Rick,

The muni's in CA have had the ability to purchase power out in the market since they never signed on to CA's deregulation plan in '98.  Initially, the rating agencies were bullish on the IOU's and bearish on the munis assuming that the munis would not get the benefit of recovering stranded costs in a timely manner.  However, as we've seen lately with all of the turmoil in CA, their perspectives have changed.  Also, Palo Alto's affluent customer base is 1/3 local and 2/3 commuters and is mainly comprised of schools including Stanford University and the Palo Alto School District.  Palo Alto in fact has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Santa Clara County.

We are basing our credit terms in all of the trading contracts to reflect the following:

-that we can only go to the proprietary 'enterprise' funds s.a. electric, gas and water funds for recourse and NOT the general fund
-the debt covenants tied to the utility revenue bonds reflect the net revenue pledge allocation of those enterprise funds to service the annual DS
-Palo Alto overall has minimal debt levels and the fact that the majority of the assets in the funds are comprised of rate stabilization fund reserves
-inclusion of Palo Alto's ability to raise rates sufficient to cover operating costs and annual DS as a MAC (I truly value this covenant)
-tiered margining lines based on S&P and Moody's ratings

Hope that helps.

Tracy

It is with great sorrow that I must announce the passing of Andy Knight, manager in the Market Risk Group. Andy succumbed to cancer on Feb. 22, 2001 and will have funeral services in Florida. There may be a memorial service here in Houston arranged through his church but details have not been announced. Please contact Veronica Valdez for details.

Andy was with RAC and Enron only briefly before being diagnosed, but made a real impact especially on those that worked closely with him. Andy had  a warm and personable style, which along with his technical capability, made him a real asset to the group. He will be missed.

Rod and Dan,

As discussed in this morning's meeting, we have taken a look at the types of trades that we feel appropriately relate to our underlying transport and storage business (basis, spreads, fixed price) and recommend the following limits for the trade policy:

VAR:			$2 million
Net Open Position:	15 Bcf
Maturity/Gap Risk:	18 Bcf


I will set up a meeting for later in the week to discuss the approval process related to the policy and procedures.

Subject:	Personal Tax Liabilities

Tim,
I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01.
For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income.
Total Earnings = $352,171
Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08 
Taxes withheld = $19,895.

I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attributed to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting of the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 2001 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress.  

I also spoke to PWC in the UK 2 minutes ago who told me that they were not doing any work for Enron at the moment.

Ted

Rick: 
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned about the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprardy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX clearing falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYMEX payment performance?????

John, just wanted to give you a heads up that I will be calling you tomorrow once our curves are loaded from today.  As of today, we show that NewPower's exposure stands at approximately $66MM now that May business has rolled off.  Of course, we do have your $20MM cash collateral and the $15MM collateral threshold, but that still leaves us about $31MM short.  I have looked and it appears that approximately $14MM of the exposure is related to June Gas Sales to NewPower.  We will probably need to have you prepay June gas and post cash or an LC for the remainder based on what tomorrows report shows.  I will be in touch by late morning to discuss how to resolve.  Thanks.

Subject:	RE: People 

Janet - thanks for your note. Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). 

Jim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.

My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people. 

I hope this addresses your issue.

Rick

Hi Rick. Hope your holding up. We are going to have all of the "on-going concern" activities here in the old building on the 30-31-32 floors. We will be splitting the estate infrastructure into two functions: on-going activities (contracts/assets we will continue to serve and perform under) and wind-up/liquidation activities. Jim Fallon will be managing the latter function and I believe he is staying in the new building for now.

We need to ensure that we have the appropriate folks from RAC engaged in the on-going concern function. I'd prefer that we continue to have them located near our floors vs. move to another location (as I hear through the grapevine). Could you suggest the folks that would be available to focus exclusively on on-going concern activities, and do you want them to stay on the 28th floor or move onto 31 with us?

Thanks.

As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.

In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel "angst".

I can't believe you finally got Vlady. You must have snuck in while I was on vacation. 

By the way, Whalley, Port and I talked and decided we would try removing all your limits except var. Lets see how it works.

Rick:  Sorry about your setback.  I want to reassure you that everything is under control here.  The material for the Finance Committee book is nearly complete.  Stephanie is working with Cassandra and the Market Risk group over the weekend to pull together their slides for the joint meeting. We will make sure that everything stays coordinated and on schedule.  So the message is RELAX AND GET HEALED UP!!   If there is anything else that you are concerned about, I will be more that glad to tackle it.    Rick C.

Kevin, given the track record of mis-behaviour, I don't fault you with the =
premise of guilt before understanding.  But I would like to assure you that=
 despite the high valuations externally, which I probably agree are fantasy=
, The Facility Services Group has a clear vision/market; it has a quality m=
anagement team; it will be under my thumb and it is conservatively valued i=
n the books.  It is much more that a Blockbuster or other like structure.  =
If you would like to discuss in detail do not hesitate to give me a call an=
d I will take you through it - both overall strategy and tactics.  Even tho=
ugh it has been a confluence of events which has caused our problems, the f=
undamental root of most issues is an inactive management team which hasn't =
managed the detail as well as we would like.  New Power in my view would no=
t have been as big a loser if we had kept it private and managed it closely=
 as a key part of the business.  Instead we took it public and let it run a=
mok.  I think you can see parallels across the company.  Initially well int=
entioned and thought out strategies fall apart when not managed appropriate=
ly.

Subject:	Contract Requirements for Monetization

Rick, here are a number of the items I look for in the contract while evaluating whether it is a candidate for monetization. Many of these characteristics will be in the contract by definition but a number of these items can tend to be inconsistent across contracts. For maximum funding efficiency, the more homogenous the pool, the better.

1. Clear events of default and prescribed remedies.
2. Clear definition of termination events and process to terminate.
3. Clear liquidated damages provisions upon termination.
4. Firm quantity - take or pay type. We can monetize a requirements contract but will receive a haircut on the value of the deal.
5. Demand charges/index premium contracts easier to monetize. Fixed price contracts require liquid hedging points to lock in the monetizable value.
6. Clear definition of force majeure and permitted duration before contract either continues with LDs or terminates due to frustration.
7. Availability of Business Interruption Insurance to cover losses during a FM event.
8. Regulatory Outs Provisions - Prefer none.
9. Severability clearly defined within the contract.
10. Firm tenor - lenders lack of appetite for a term contract with annual evergreen provisions. If they are not legally obligated, little if any value.
11. Volumetric Take Requirements - Are there make-up provisions for volumes paid for but not taken. If the counterparty didn't purchase the annual minimum, is there an immediate LD payment or does the party have three months for instance to make-up the deficiency.
12. Ability to assign the receivables for financing purposes. Even better if we can assign the contract itself as security.
13. Who is the credit? Is there credit support? Is it capped?
14. Netting provisions. Prefer to have no netting or right of set-off to isolate the payment stream from the Enron estate. Typically, not possible and Enron has to indemnify for set-off claims.
15. Prepayment provisions - Does the counterparty have the right to unilaterally early terminate? Monetization may incur make-whole damages upon a prepayment. Can we pass this cost through as a "break" cost of early unwind.

This is my quick cheat sheet of items I screen for. I've asked a few others to give me their thoughts as well and will append to the list. Thanks.

Dear Mr Buy,

I have tried on a number of occasions to get hold of you by telephone, but
have now been advised by one of your colleagues to send an email instead.

Briefly, I work for a company here in London called RK Analytics which
undertakes consulting projects for clients in the financial arena.

In this instance, my client is a major player in commodity-related risk
management products.  My client is hoping to determine how it can better
improve the service it offers to entities such as Enron, and in order to do
this it has commissioned my services to conduct interviews with a number of
its clients (or potential clients).

To date, we've been lucky enough to have the cooperation of everyone we've
approached and I was therefore hoping that you yourself might be prepared to
answer some questions for me (bearing in mind that your answers would be
treated in confidence).

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
Otherwise, I attach herewith a questionnaire and would be most grateful if
we could find an opportunity to discuss this further over the next days.

I appreciate your time and consideration,

Kind regards,

Naomi Driver

Scott- I discussed the sale of Mariner's deepwater assets with Dave Gorte and he confirmed that any sale would require both creditors committee and bankruptcy court approval prior to consummation of the deal.

A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. More to come.

I think we urgently (next 2 days) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk. Counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, both in the US and UK. I have two suggestions:

-allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity
or
-appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.

For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with Koch.

The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting.  The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for approval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would recommend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.

I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee meetings.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we can decide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation needs to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it himself.

Tim,

Can you rough out a slide on rating agencies?  I also want to update liquidity with some comments about LCs and refinancing requirements including Rawhide, Bank RC, Marlin and Osprey.  We probably have to discuss trade behavior and margin.

My first official involvement (along with Chip)  was a meeting with Brad Richter on 5/23 to discuss the strategy and valuation approach.  This was the EBS' structuring teams introduction as well.   The model that Lehman had prepared only looked at the Managed Hosting business and had a number of questionable assumptions that were pointed out to the corporate development team.  

RAC did not prepare its own numbers.  I had more questions about strategy and understanding the different parts of the transaction.

 RAC was not invited to the meeting with Skilling.

The transaction was being run by EBS Corporate Development - Jeff Donohue was heavily involved from the start of discussions with the company.  Brad Richter, who works for Donohue, was the day to day contact at the end.

I spoke briefly yesterday with Brad Richter who was going to put something more formal together.  I will send that to you when I have it.

Jeff and the commercial team had different opinions about the managed hosting side of the business.  Part of EBS liked the technical capabilitiy of PSI Net and felt that this capability would allow EBS to run a managed hosting business (basically outsourcing the operation of company web sites).  Jeff did not like this business and had told EBS last week to not put any growth on this part of the business in their analysis.  

Without growth on the managed hosting part of the business, EBS needed to find $100 million/year of benefit through the acquisition.  A large part of this would have come from IP Transit which, due to its size, PSI Net would have received free through peering and which EBS currently pays for.  These saving depend a lot on hockey stick projections from EBS' current activities (although MSN would provide a large portion of this savings).  The rest of the benefit was to come through cross selling PSI Net's existing customers and new customers obtained due to the combination of their technical capability and Enron's financial capability.  This increased technical capability is diametrically opposed to Project Reset (the sale of EBS' long haul network to Qwest in return for a series of options on capacity).

PSI Net wanted a quick decision and a purchase of the whole company through a packaged bankruptcy to try and maintain staff and customers.  I have heard comments that they wanted Enron to purchase their consulting arm as well.  This group had approximately 1,000 people and held no particular interest to EBS.  I do not know whether it was the speed of the transaction, the consulting arm, the managed hosting business, or the increased technical direction that killed the transaction.

Hi Rick, hope you're doing okay .  . .  
Have a request re your write-up.  Can we,  please, shift the emphasis from the 'effective cro' - to how you managed the  risk inherent in the huge transition Enron has made, completely evolved, from an  energy to an ebusiness company.  Address online marketplaces/the value-add;  the shifting strategies involved in transitioning the company . . .  
Is this okay?
I'll need the paragraph/bullets by Thurs pm, if at  all possible.  Thanks, Rick and take care -
PS  Also need your brief bio and complete  contact info (incl mailing address)

    Thanks for your note and staying in touch during a time when a huminata=
rian crises could easily spiral into something  where the worste news is ye=
t to come.   Here is what Ive found out...
=20
    NYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up cl=
earing, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past, th=
e first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though =
the later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse paym=
ents have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange is=
 likely to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating =
the need for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an =
effort is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above (bas=
ed on yet to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some degree o=
f transaction data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment perform=
ance from NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing paymen=
t delays extend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we may se=
e delayed payments from weaker credits in related swap and physical markets=
.  In this regard, the markets have breathing room since the terrorist atta=
cks didnt occur late in the month.  Finally, there have been general commen=
ts from Treasury and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock exchange payment=
s, and the assumption is that the same guarantees would apply to the NY com=
modity exchanges (but this asumption has not been validated or addressed di=
rectly in public comments).  Hope this helps.  Brad.

        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned a=
bout the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYM=
EX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worrie=
d that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might foll=
ow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprar=
dy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX cle=
aring falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NY=
MEX payment performance?????

Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

Attached are the minutes from the February 6 Corporate Responsibility Task Force meeting.   Also attached is a chart outlining in more detail the metrics for success for each subcommittee.  The second document is the result of a meeting among subcommittee chairs and other interested task force members to help flesh out their purpose as a step toward developing a measurable work plan.

Let me know if you have questions or comments.  If you have not been contacted already, you will be hearing from your subcommittee chairs shortly regarding your next subcommittee meeting.  We also plan to set the date of the next overall task force meeting within the next couple of weeks.

Dawn,
Per a meeting today with Rick Buy and Louise Kitchen it was determined that the allocation for RAC- Portfolio (Rick Carson- 100053) of $544K to ENA was incorrect. Please amend as follows:

ENA	 $109K
EPI	$435K

This is necessary because of the asset transfer to EPI and the work associated with these assets.

From: 	Murphy, Ted

Subject:	RE: London Assignment

Rick,
Amongst my concerns are:
	The budget calls for 54 heads to do the job in EEL-RAC. There are currently 31 with 3 offers on the table on 5/14.
	There was absolutely no on going recruiting effort here, therefore I have to start from scratch.
	The heads that are here are junior at best with little or no Enron or management experience.
	There is such a dearth of senior people here that there are almost no people to screen resumes or interview candidates
	There is no understanding of the role of RAC in Enron Europe.
[Buy, Rick]  
Agree, you are supposed to fix all of the above!
	The IT platform and operational problems put the risk management activities of our group back 3 years at least.
[Buy, Rick]  Agree this is an issue. 
	The Houston based RAC group (primarily credit) is provincial, uncooperative and boring.
[Buy, Rick]  At least they are in their seats working. Maybe you should send Rod back since he is a part of the Houston bore core. You have failed to build consensus in your credit initiative. Without buy-in it is almost impossible to implement change at Enron
	In addition to losing net 9 bodies here, the Market Risk group in Houston lost 4 and is poised to lose several more because of  
		disappointment  with the opportunity set within RAC.
[Buy, Rick]  I find it curious that our primary problem with turnover is in Houston Market Risk and London. Linkage?? If people aren't satisfied for the right reasons, they should leave. There is all kind of opportunity in RAC. People are going all over the world and doing different things. We have people in Portland, Sydney, Calgary, London. People have left the group and done well as well. We offer lifetime career satisfaction guarantees to no one. 
	We are uncompetitive with respect to all-in compensation, title, and resources to do the job as evidenced by an inability to recruit good talent.
[Buy, Rick]  Disagree. We did an extensive study last year and adjusted everyone that needed adjustment. It is difficult to recruit. It is one of the hardest things to do in management. It requires salesmanship, good timing and closing ability, especially when a group is in turmoil.
	I can rebuild this group but it is going to take longer than anyone thought because of poor previous management.
	Finally, I am trouble finding my own motivation.  I believe that I continue to do a good job for the firm yet I do not feel that I am recognized for the effort.
[Buy, Rick]  Memos, and other ill thought out outbursts like this are precisely why you are not recognized.
	This painful rebuilding process does nothing to make me smarter, more valuable or more interesting excep through a fairly monumental physical 			and emotional effort on my part.	
[Buy, Rick]  I would look at it as an opportunity to turn around a segment of the company that needs help which is precisely why you were sent to London. I don't particularly care what it does for Ted Murphy.

In  summary here, unless you had just a really bad day, you oght to consider an alternative assignment either in Enron or outside. You were sent to London to fix a problem the organization has. You are lucky in that there is agreement that there is a problem and resources are available ($) to fix them. This is not unlike Joe Gold taking over metals, or Delaney taking over EES. Big mess, needs fixing. People that do this are usually recognized.

[Buy, Rick]  You may want to discuss this tomorrow.   I'm fairly open. 
 Rick
I am interested in your commments
Ted

I will think about it. We are achieving the correct outcome here but the timing is off. Concentrate on Caulfield and Oman. Get Brown involved to make sure we get those guys. Use Ene options as a currency to entice them. Upside much better than Chase/JP. Just a thought. Rick

Since the Gas Trading and Gas Origination RAC Groups have identical RAC members (primary business contacts are different), the group(s) decided to combine.
Primarily the same types of issues - Fewer meetings

Also, with Mark Bonney handling O&G  from Investment Valuation, he has replaced Jeff Soo on these teams.

On the subject of developing our three most serious issues, all groups are making progress or are complete. 
You may (not) want to see them !

Effective immediately, I want to sign all Dashes for RAC. I have asked Dave to continue reviewing the deals and initial the Dash but I want to sign them. This will enable me to be more on top of transactions and also allow me to relate to the other things that are going on. Thanks for your cooperation.  Rick

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.

Bill, 

It's about 2.5 million dollars (cash not LC), and this helps us cover a short position we need to cover.  I want to do this deal.

John:

Appreciate seeing the old e-mail again, but remind you that the Shenhua cargo was agreed 22 Oct.  As mentioned, we will certainly try to push Shenhua to entertain alternative arrangements, but the Chinese are usually quite difficult on this subject (to date, all Chinese cargoes have required Enron to post an LC).  It's a good idea to get Shankman thinking about this one today, because it is likely that we will need to post an LC for this cargo.  If timing is an issue, I'm sure we can drag the process out a few weeks since delivery is not until mid-Jan.

Regardless, need your input as soon as possible on whether we can continue transacting business where cash collection is not coincident (or in advance of) cash out the door.

Thks,

Stu

Stu - 

As per the e-mail below, RAC must be contacted prior to transacting on an L/C basis.  This was the same message I conveyed to the Australian team early last week.  The Shenhua deal definitely falls within the description and is an issue to be resolved.

I will talk to Jeff Shankman today about the use of L/Cs and capital in the near future, and see what resolution can be reached with the positions and strategy you hold in your book.

In this current climate we should try wherever possible not to commit to posting collateral to counterparties for physical purchases of product unless absolutely necessary.  We should offer an Enron Corp guarantee as an alternative.  In the event that we are asked to post security to a counterparty would you please contact credit before doing so.
The credit hotline number is 36555

thanks for your co-operation.

6.	What is the sensitivity analysis of the trading portfolios from a liquidity and margining requirement standpoint based upon i) two standard deviations in the relevant underlying commodity price both upward and downward, ii) a one notch credit downgrade by S&P, in addition to the action already taken by Moody's and Fitch, and iii) a combination of the two scenarios? (BNP)  What is the availability of sufficient liquidity to accommodate such scenarios? (BNP)

14.	What financial measures does the company consider important in tracking the success of its trading business? (S)

16.	What is the model vetting process?  Who is responsible for validating traders' models?  What is the time lag between front office development of a model and validation?  Are there any products that use unvalidated models for trading purposes or P&L? (S)

18.	Who monitors limits? (S)
19.	How frequently is the trading operation audited by internal and external auditors? (S)

21.	What is the current and year end expected counterparty exposure?  Gross or net of collateral? (S)
22.	What is the investment/non-investment grade counterparty exposure split for 2000 and first quarter 2001? (S)
23.	What percentage of investment grade counterparty credit risk is BBB+ or below? (S)

Mr. Buy,

Just wanted to get back with you to confirm that the income fund that you are invested in has earnings applied on a daily basis.  Attached is a transaction summary that reveals that the interest credited between 2/7/01 and 3/31/01 totals $6,080.71.

 << File: Buy Transaction Summary.xls >> 

Interest rate for the 1st QTR was approx. 1.59%.  On a prorata basis the interest recorded appears to be reasonable.  I would be happy to secure additional information from the recordkeeper concerning daily earnings on your account.  Please let me know if this additional information would be meaningful.

Have a great day!

Kim Bolton

Rick,

I just realized that I failed to thank you for coming to the Woodlands last month to speak to the EAM and AOPS teams regarding risk management at EES.  In the brief time I've been at Enron, I've focused on bringing a more disciplined approach to, and understanding of, the importance of identifying and managing the risk inherent in the EAM business.  However, you provided a far more global perspective, including the view senior management, the Board, and the investment community. It meant a lot to the group to have someone from senior management take the time to meet with us.   

I'd also like to acknowledge the support we've received from Jay and others within RAC  - I appreciate their efforts.

Again, thanks for the visit.

Subject:	Amber and StorageApps Acquired

In a absolutely dead tech market, two of the EBS portfolio companies announced they were being acquired today.  StorageApps is being acquired by Hewlett Packard for $350 million, and Amber Networks is being acquired by Nokia for $421 million.  If I am not mistaken, these are the 2 largest technology acquisitions of 2001 (where only a handful of acquisitions have been made in total all year).

Net gains to Enron on both of these investments (which were both made in 2000) will be small, but the acquisitions are a verification of EBS Ventures ability to pick the best telecom investments in the market (no other single investor is in both of these deals).  Steven Sheldon and Patrick Hickey deserve tremendous credit for originating and managing these investments.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland

Hang in there.  Beleive it or not, everyone in the industry I talk with is
pulling for Enron.  I hope the bank deal comes through quickly.

I wonder which beach AF is on right now.

I thought I'd pass this along in case you need a laugh.

I get snail mail and file the statements. You should too.  You can view your account online, with a password, but keep getting written confirmations and statements. You never know if a plane might crash into their computers. Love, Dad (A time will come when you don't need paper but I don't think we are there yet.)

Rick, thanks for taking so much of your time to explain RAC to the IPG group.  You said all the right things and left them with exactly the impression we were shooting for.  We are now trying to finalize a term sheet so we will be working with your folks to get this transaction down the road.  If I can return the favor let me know.  Thanks again.

Today WSJ article on page 1 is good example of what we try to capture. They weren't MTM'ing their junk bond portfolio and it went against them. They were also trying to increase earnings by taking on more risk, without the risk system in place. They fired cfo and are looking for a risk person!! Good reading. FYI, Rick

As you are now aware, the United Way Campaign has now kicked-off and RAC is very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and will be taking place.  First of all, Monday morning, each of you should have received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United Way activities for the week.  The building blocks symbolize Enron's commitment to "Building Houston's Future" with the United Way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that Enron employees will be engaging in to show support for the United Way Agencies and the Houston community.

To highlight this week's activities:

On Wednesday, August 8, many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in the 2001 Enron Days of Caring.  The Enron Corporate Team, of which RAC is a large and important part, will be providing assistance to the Jewish Community Center.  If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity--thank you.  If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to, please contact any one of this year's RAC United Way Campaign Coordinators--Cindy Hudler, Rebecca Phillips, Darren Vanek, Shelli Smith, Becky Caudle, Cassandra Schultz or Chip Schneider.

On Friday, August 10, Enron will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick-Fil-A and activities to celebrate Enron employee efforts during the week.  Included in this event will be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around Enron including Dave Gorte and Chip Schneider on the Corporate Team.  Please plan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues.

Of course, underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the Houston area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002.  This year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the Houston area during Tropical Storm Alison.  In addition to providing their typical day-to-day community services, many United Way Agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm.  A contribution to the United Way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need.  Remember approximately $0.90 out of every $1.00 go directly to benefit our friends, neighbors and fellow citizens in the Houston area.  I sincerely encourage you to support RAC's objective of 100% participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution.  Contributions can be made by clicking on the Enron Human Resources website at https://hrglobal.enron.com.

Thanks for your support. 

Best regards,

Rick

Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

	Please call with any questions or comments.

It might be good if you two participate in this discussion with Hickerson in the morning.  Also, David, you might want to discuss w/Whalley beforehand.  What exactly are we going to restrict Gary and his traders from trading?  Sheila Glover says we may have trader retention issues if the traders are prohibited from trading for their own account the securities that they are most familiar with...
 
But I think this is clearly contrary to how Ted, Legal, etc. think our policy should work.  So what are we willing to do to compromise, if anything?  The  policy says the Risk Committee can give dispensation.  To do this, do we want to require some type of review of Hickerson's personal accounts? And who would do that?
 
Cassandra.

Gary,
Judy is setting up a conference call for 15 minutes on Thursday morning to discuss Employee Trading, as currently defined in the Risk Management Policy which be sent to BOD this Friday.
 
The policy, as it currently stands, does not allow a person to trade positions in his personal account relating to his trading area.  For Financials, this has been defined to restrict to that employees' specific area of responsiblity.  For instance, the portfolio manager of Technology would not be able to hold tech stocks in his personal or 3rd party account.  
 
Cassandra will be able to provide some background on the input she is receiving from other groups.  
 
We can discuss alternatives which may be more palatable.  For instance, a person would declare where their personal brokerage accounts are held and statements are reviewed.

Sheila - I tried to clarify it a bit more, so take a look at this instead of the version in the policy you received this morning.  Do you think we need to review w/Gary?  I think he told me his management had approved his traders trading for their own account, the same things they trade for Enron. I may have misunderstood.  But per extensive discussion on that subject with Legal, Compliance, Ted Murphy, etc., this is not what our policy has been to date, and per review of best practices at the big trading houses, our new policy will not permit this either.  Just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page.
(1st paragraph is the key - the rest is restricted list, etc.)
Thanks,
Cassandra.
7.2 Employee Trading
No employee of the Company may engage in the trading of any position for the benefit of any party other than the Company, whether for their own account or for the account of any third party, where such position relates to any security, commodity, contract or derivative thereof within any Commodity Group listed in Appendix A.  The only exception to this restriction is that employees may trade those items within the Commodity Groups listed under the heading "Financials" in Appendix A, if those items do not fall within such employee's responsibility at the Company.
Periodically, certain employees, their family members and anybody that is financially dependent on those employees, may also be restricted from trading specific securities and derivatives thereof.   In addition to these trading restrictions, if any employee should at any time possess non-public information about any public company, that employee, the employee's family members and anybody that is financially dependent on that employee, shall be restricted from trading in that issue, and that employee may not disclose the non-public material information to anyone that does not have a business need to know.  
Employees must seek dispensation from the Risk Management Committee for any exception to these requirements.  In no case should employees' personal trading conflict with the Company's trading initiatives. Employee with questions regarding employee trading and investing should contact the Company's Compliance department.

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration.

-	The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
-	Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
-	All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
-	Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams.
-	Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
- 	Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings.
-	There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio.
-	All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to help out if needed.
-	If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
-	Encourage weak links in team to perform.
-	Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
-	If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor.
-	Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

Rick

Subject:	Call to Bob Glynn

Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn:

Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001. There was considerable discussion which I have summarized below.

Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a blended debt and equity return.(?)

Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.

Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.

Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough cash to operate.

This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp.

Karen- talked to Whalley on this. He said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people. So I guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere. A big concern Enron has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets. You need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time. Rick

As we discussed yesterday, the exchange ratio adjusted price comparison is the key ratio to guage market merger appetite.   I also included the ENE 6 5/8% 10/15/03 bond price to view the credit market's perception.
I'll send it around from time to time.  An excel file is attached.

Rick --

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's website that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.

Rick: As you may recall, Andy had asked me to attend the Audit and Finance Committee meetings at the last Board meeting.  I was curious whether you thought it was a good idea for me to attend the Finance Committee meetings on a going forward basis (in the event of any LJM  discussion, or otherwise)?  I would be happy to do so, but my feelings won't be bruised if you think it unnecessary.


On a somewhat related point, during my last meeting with Rick Causey of about two weeks ago, Rick suggested that the three of us get together monthly to discuss what transactions are being discussed with LJM (or may have even closed during that time period), our related internal reviews, and documentation.  Are you ok with this arrangement?

Thanks.

Bobbi --
In the midst of the Enron bankruptcy in december, I discussed my situation ( my wife's late term pregnancy)  with my immediate supervisor Ted Murphy.  We agreed that with the uncertainty, we should return to Houston and check with Ted's Houston team for next steps.  When I returned to Houston and requested information on my work status, no one was able to inform me whether I was employed or had been laid off.  At this point, I decided to use my outstanding vacation time to find a place to live and prepare for the baby.
We are expecting the baby's arrival at any time.  Afterwards, I will take a paternity leave and discuss my options with Ted at that time.
Regards,
Rudi

Subject:	Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide information to us in a timely and accurate fashion.

Rick,

Following up on our discussion this morning, Scott Earnest and his staff ( including Michelle Bruce) need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts in providing timely information to Risk.

Their initiative came along about the same time Jeff Shankman took over Global Markets; it enables them to run a same day VaR for worldwide trading ( Houston, London and Singapore books are all closed in Houston ) as well as for us to to get our "official " information reliably by the the opening of business next day.

rick,
David's review should be in his file in Houston, but, if not, I should be able to retrieve it.    Generally, I believe he has done a good job.  I continued to emphasize that he had to find avenues to use his technical strenght to influence the firm's behaviour rather than expecting it to be enough to be right. and that he needed to proactively communicate with other groups, like ops and commercial, with an eye toward empathy for their stance on contentious issues. 
I also said that he continues to be a viable candidate for promotion at year end.
Thoughts?

Subject:	Getting organized

All:

We have set up the following recurring meetings:

1. One hour on Thursdays with Mark Haedicke and his legal team
2. One half hour on Monday and Wednesday with Bill, Molly, Teresa, Sharon, Tracey, and Lisa.  Also Rita Bohner, Paul Darmitzel and Ed Essandoh of EES legal will attend.   This meeting will be primarily for the dealing with the high volume of small EES deals.   The aim is to define the process and drill on implementation (notices, termination, physical disconnection, proofs of claim, etc.).    Molly has made great strides here.
3. Sharon Sullo and Tracey Kozadinos are developing a standardized database for the effort.   Debbie Brackett has gotten involved on system feeds.  More to come on this.

The initial thoughts with Mark Haedicke were to parse the debtors into two or three baskets.   Smallest size would be a process.  We are grappling with whether we need a mid size and a large size process.

As not all these deals show up on the Hot Deals Report.   I have scratched out the top ten, high touch, efforts below:

1. PG&E
2. Edison
3. 360
4. NPW
5. Polaroid
6. California PX
7. Global Crossing
8. DPC LNG
9. EPIK
10. Cuiab? Turbine 11

Regards,



Michael

Heard back from Tim. Please plan on attending. Port, Bradford, you and I will attend from RAC. Moody's is having trouble with our loss of $694MM that I told them when they were here. We need to start pulling together explicitly why we lost so much in one day, what the var limits were that day and what has been the experience since then. Tx Rick

Rick,
I have no problem making the trip.  I will leave it to you to consider the resources necessary to give the pitch.  I don't think there is much else that as important.  I have just finished reading the book 'When Genius Failed' about LTCM and, at the end of the day, funding positions through turmoil is almost more important than being right in the first place.  FYI, I will be in Houston on 6/21 for the prc. Originally planned to leave on 6/22.  Could stay through weekend and fly back to London thru NY.
Let me know

Jeff Delapino (sp?) from Chase has asked me to look into the above transaction to change from monthly collateralization to daily. Do you know who is familiar with this deal? Rick

No interest in participating. As you can imagine Enron gets a large number of similar requests and I have adopted a policy of not cooperating, purely from a time management standpoint. Sorry, Rick Buy

Dear Mr Buy,

I have tried on a number of occasions to get hold of you by telephone, but
have now been advised by one of your colleagues to send an email instead.

Briefly, I work for a company here in London called RK Analytics which
undertakes consulting projects for clients in the financial arena.

In this instance, my client is a major player in commodity-related risk
management products.  My client is hoping to determine how it can better
improve the service it offers to entities such as Enron, and in order to do
this it has commissioned my services to conduct interviews with a number of
its clients (or potential clients).

To date, we've been lucky enough to have the cooperation of everyone we've
approached and I was therefore hoping that you yourself might be prepared to
answer some questions for me (bearing in mind that your answers would be
treated in confidence).

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
Otherwise, I attach herewith a questionnaire and would be most grateful if
we could find an opportunity to discuss this further over the next days.

I appreciate your time and consideration,

Kind regards,

Naomi Driver
Director

Michael    -- as requested in this morning's meeting (Houston time)
attached below is the file which reflects the graphs that we spoke about this morning.

There were 16 errors last week for all business units(10 of which were Europe's).  An "error" in this case is usually very material, like not being able to pick up the whole UK power position and p/l.

we are tracking several Metrics to understand how Human vs IT processes are affecting the daily aggregation effort.

I am happy to discuss if you would like.

It may be easier to read if you have someone print out the graphs -- the come up rather small on the screen
