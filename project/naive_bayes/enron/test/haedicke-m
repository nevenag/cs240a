context of the facts placed before us 2      The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law  The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law  However Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not apart from stating that DPC will be Enrons agent stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes 3      Yes our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement  However if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee either as such or by way of damage then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC Kind regards Suresh -----Original Message-----From   AndrewEdisonenroncom SMTPAndrewEdisonenroncom Sent   Friday September 21 2001 641 PM To     sureshtalwarcrawfordbayleycom

you on the 19th of September 2001 on the Fuel Management Agreement Agreement You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc EnronFuel Manager could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any potential theories such as agency relationship third party beneficiary claims etc MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement  These include amongst others approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed by the Fuel Manager providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA etc There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf Enrons right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement is contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB  I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by the provisions of the PPA to which Enron is not a party  Therefore there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEBDPC as regards the PPA  As a result Enron has no claim against MSEB for non-payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions under the Agreement I trust I have answered your query adequately  Please feel free to call for any questions that you may have Kind regards Suresh This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its
