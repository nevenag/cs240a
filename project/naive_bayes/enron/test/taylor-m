Well I am taking a chance I do know one of the people and they have received about 600 so far  She also said that it is the easiest money she has ever made So lets give it a try You have lost a lot more than this at the park PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY 600 CAN GET YOU THOUSANDS IN JUST A FEW MONTHS This method works in a very short time The cost is only 600 This is the 16th day since I started receiving  cash and so far I have received 5845 in 1 Billsso I guess this is really working already Give it a try All I did was follow the instructions in the letter that I received below and sent out some e-mail to people that responded to my ads Here is a testimony from one of the thousands that have benefited from this get-rich-quick plan Im a retired attorney and about a year ago a man came to me with a letter The letter he brought to me is the same letter before you now He asked me to verify that this letter was legal I told him that I would review it and get back to him When I first read the letter I thought it was some off the wall idea to make money A week later I met again with my client to discuss the issue I told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 legal I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will be all right I was curious about the letter so he told me how it worked I thought it was a long shot so I decided against participating Before my client left I asked him to keep me updated as to his results About two months later he called me to tell me that he had received more than 80000000 in cash I didnt believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself I thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose I followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters Sure enough the money started coming in It came slowly at first but after three weeks I was getting more than I could open in a day After three months the money stopped coming I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled 86843900 I earn a good living as an attorney but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you there is a lot of stress that comes with the territory I decided if things worked out I would retire from practice and play golf This time I sent out 500 letters Well three months later I had totaled 234417800 I met my old client for lunch to find out exactly how it works He told me that there were a few similar letters going around What made this one different is the fact that there were six names on the letter not three like most others That fact alone resulted in more returns The other factor was the advice I gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal I bet now you are curious about what little changes I told him to make Well if you send a letter like this one out to be legal you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar I told him that anyone sending a dollar must receive something in RETURN So when you send a dollar to each of the six names on the list you must include a slip of paper saying Please add me to your mailing list and include your name mailing address and e-mail address This is the key to the program The item you will receive for your dollar sent is THIS letter and the right to earn thousands Follow the simple instructions EXACTLY and in less than three months you should receive MORE THAN 80000000 IN COLD HARD CASH 1 IMMEDIATELY send ONE DOLLAR 100 US to each of the six people listed below THE SOONER YOU SEND THE 100 LETTERS THE SOONER YOU CAN START GETTING A RETURN Wrap the dollar in order to prevent thievery in a note saying PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST Include YOUR NAME MAILING ADDRESS AND E-MAIL ADDRESS REMEMBER if you dont ask for the service USE OF THIS LETTER WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR YOU 1Jameson DeVeau 37 Laurelwood Drive Wallingford CT 06492 jamiepoo71hotmailcom 2 SCOTT DAVENPORT 3602 BURKE RD71 PASADENA TEXAS 77504

e-mail to each of the names above with 1 SENT in the subject line Write your name and mailing address This is important as it would inform them as to how many people had joined the program under them Likewise it will give them the estimate of how many one-dollar bills they should receive 3 REMOVE the NAME and ADDRESS NEXT to 1 at the TOP of the list and move the rest of the names UP one position Then place YOUR name in the 6 spot This is best done by saving this to a file then enter in your information on line 6 Be careful when you type the addresses Dont forget to PROOFREAD them Make SURE that the names and addresses are correct Also include your e-mail address 4 When you have COMPLETED the above instructions you have several options on how you market the letter - through the Postal Service through E-mail to at least 200 people IF YOU HAVE AN FFA PAGE THAT WILL BE EASY or through posting in FREE CLASSIFIED ADS and NEWSGROUPS ON THE INTERNET or through whatever way you deem is legal This letter has been proven perfectly legal for all of the above as long as you follow the instructions because you are purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list You can also use a

pile up  MAKE SURE you send One US dollar to each of the six names on the list This is VERY IMPORTANT with a note saying PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST PS Youve read this far so let me ask you one simple question WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE 600  Even with a 1 return you will still get 10000000 in 90 DAYS What you can gain is an income like the example in this letter You will have a very small expense but you will reap HUGE potential returns What do you have to lose I invite you to JOIN our mailing list RIGHT NOW Thank you for your time GOOD LUCK  BEST WISHES TO YOU This is a one time

Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments FERC rejected the request by PGE to modify the Code of Conduct so that they could buy on EnronOnline  Basically FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed FERC found that There is for example no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse  We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price  While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to buy at FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file

Electric  Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments 96 FERC    61 093 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Portland General Electric Company         Docket No ER01-2097-000 Enron Power Marketing Inc                  Docket No ER01-2103-000 ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE Issued July 20 2001 In this order we reject without prejudice proposed amendments of Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI and Portland General Electric PGE to their respective market-based rate tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using the EnronOnline trading platform I   Background On May 22 2001 in separate filings affiliates PGE in Docket No ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No ER01-2103-000 collectively Applicants filed to amend their respective market-based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through the EnronOnline trading platform and to prohibit communication among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on 1 EnronOnline   This amendment does not supplant the existing provisions of PGEs and EPMIs currently effective tariffs which allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there are captive customers eg allowing a public utility to sell to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-affiliates requiring simultaneous offers to non-affiliates or requiring use of a relevant established index  Rather PGE and EPMI propose to amend their respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make 1 The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks an Enron Corp subsidiary  EnronOnline is a free Internet-based transaction system which allows EPMIs customers to view real time prices from EPMIs traders and transact instantly online  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application but rather EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in buying from and selling power to third parties Docket Nos ER01-2097-000 -2-and ER01-2103-000 inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline with restrictions different than those in place but that they state will still prevent affiliate abuse  Applicants state that the Commissions requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in electronic commerce and in particular the Commissions requirement that PGE post on its website notice of a potential purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline since EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not provide for a waiting period before consummating the 2 transaction   According to Applicants this deprives PGE of the ability to buy or sell power from perhaps the largest marketer 3 in its region to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers II  Notice of Filing and InterventionsProtests Notices of the filings were published in the Federal Register 66 Fed Reg 29939 2001 Docket No ER01-2097-000 and 66 Fed Reg 30180 2001 Docket No ER01-2103-000 with motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before June 12 2001  None was filed III Discussion The Commission allows power marketers and their public utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate abuse  As the Commission has explained affiliate abuse can occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers sells power at below-market prices to or purchases power at above-market prices from an affiliate without captive customers such as a power marketer affiliate  One way in which the Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate 4 sales at an established relevant market price or index Another way when there is no assurance that the affiliates are transacting at the prevailing market price is to adopt various conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent 5 affiliate abuse 2 EPMI Application at 3 PGE Application at 4 3 EPMI Application at 3 PGE Application at 4 4 See eg DPL Energy Inc 90 FERC   61200 2000 accord First Energy Trading Services Inc 88 FERC   61067 at 61156 1999 5 Eg GPU Advanced Resources Inc 81 FERC   61335 at continued Docket Nos ER01-2097-000 -3-and ER01-2103-000 Here Applicants request that the Commission permit them to use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales subject to the following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient protection against affiliate abuse  PGE when buying from EPMI using EnronOnline will be required to take the transaction price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular 6 location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment   In 7 addition PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction being finalized  Applicants also propose to amend their respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication regarding prices posted on EnronOnline Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at 5 continued 62539 1997 GPU Detroit Edison Company 80 FERC   61348 at 62197-98 1997 Detroit Edison  In GPU the Commission allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard supplier agreements  Accord First Energy Trading  Power Marketing Inc 84 FERC   61214 at 62037-38 rehg denied 85 FERC   61311 1998  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-affiliates that the utility simultaneously offer through its electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate offered to its affiliate and that all prices charged to the affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin board  Accord Jersey Central Power  Light Co 82 FERC 61023 at 61071 1998 Commonwealth Edison Co 85 FERC 61288 at 62176-77 1998 6 EPMI Application at 4 PGE Application at 5 7 In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline EPMI would know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or lower than that currently available  Applications at 3  While Applicants do not define Limit Order the common understanding is that unlike a market order which instructs a broker to transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in the marketplace a limit order instructs a broker to fill the order only if certain conditions are met  Generally a limit order may be either a day order in which case it expires when the market closes if unfilled or good-until-canceled in which case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled Docket Nos ER01-2097-000 -4-and ER01-2103-000 the posted price a price that is offered to all market participants and there will be no transactions in which EPMI knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is finalized  Thus Applicants contend that not only will PGE be unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of PGE  In addition because the EnronOnline price is posted electronically and is available to all market participants Applicants state that PGEs customers have the opportunity to transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and conditions that are available to PGE Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the Commissions affiliate abuse requirements and conditions eg protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its 8 transactions with its affiliate EPMI   The thrust of Applicants argument is that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline a public medium for selling power between affiliates  We disagree  While perhaps faster and easier to use than phone calls faxes or letters an Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade and speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied  There is for example no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline 9 represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse  We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price  While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI 10 is willing to buy at    For other transactions through media other than EnronOnline including other exchanges EPMI might be 8 See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text citing cases that discuss Commissions underlying concerns with affiliate power sales 9 See supra note 4 and accompanying text 10 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a participant  For sales EPMI is the seller  For purchases EPMI is the buyer Docket Nos ER01-2097-000 -5-and ER01-2103-000 11 willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices Moreover Applicants provide no information about how product prices posted by EPMI are determined or whether there would be any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via EnronOnline or even whether there are other similar but non-affiliated Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically trade those products to attain similar benefits Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline we now turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE through EnronOnline there is nothing in the Applicants proposed restrictions that would require PGE to simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate offered to the affiliate  The Commission requires that with respect to any power offered to its affiliate PGE make the same offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its electronic bulletin board  But it is unclear whether PGE can or will make the same offer to non-affiliates Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited from submitting Limit Orders which would prevent EPMI from knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction  Again this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-market prices The Commission is not assured by the Applicants proposal that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commissions expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for inter-affiliate power sales transactions  There is for example no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how unaffiliated customers or other interested parties would monitor inter-affiliate transactions For the above reasons we will reject the proposed amendments without prejudice to Applicants revising their proposal to address the Commissions concerns and incorporating appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse 11 Likewise PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices Docket Nos ER01-2097-000 -6-and ER01-2103-000 The Commission orders Applicants proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected without prejudice as discussed in the body of this order By the Commission  S E A L  David P Boergers Secretary -

final text file 2001 Cover FERTILIZERS Its time to manage your price risk Logo Spread 1 Managing Price Risk For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business To compete effectively in your industry you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings facilitate cash flow management and bring greater certainty to financing investment and acquisition decisions Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows Now theres help For many years Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world were intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell using EnronOnline our Internet-based global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather news and market information In addition it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products Spread 2 Finally we can leverage in your market our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America For example we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce In this type of transaction you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your companys revenues earnings and cash-flow For solutions to this apparent paradox turn to Enron As a leading provider of price management services across various industries we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently hedge the risks associated with their pricing and ultimately lower your cost of capital Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here then spend a few more moments with Enron Well review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure Spread 3 SWAPS Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons the most common being no upfront transaction cost Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa They are used most often to fix or lock in prices and margins between prices In exchange for price protection the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index Settlement is financial - ie cash changes hands physical product does not Each month during the life of the transaction the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party Spread 4 Swap Producer example AmmoniaKing a producer of ammonia is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan To eliminate this threat AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at 100ton on 300000 tons of ammonia or 75 percent of monthly production This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target chart 1 DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP         AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice at floating market prices         On a monthly basis AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of 100ton and the prevailing floating price spread         For example if the floating spread is 95ton in a given month AmmoniaKing will receive 5ton in a given month on 300000 tons However if the floating spread is 105ton AmmoniaKing will owe 5ton to Enron         AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target Spread 5 Swap End-user example FertPro a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products The companys customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude On the other hand customers dont necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall they simply want a listed price they can count on To service its customers while protecting its margins FertPro enters into a one-year price swap The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at 100ton on a monthly volume of 10000 tons or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales chart 2 DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP         FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices         On a monthly basis FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of 100ton and the floating price for ammonia         For example if the floating price for ammonia is 105 in a given month FertPro will receive 5ton on 10000 tons However if the floating price is 95ton FertPro will owe 5ton to Enron         The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of 100ton         The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices Spread 6 CAPS  FLOORS Like Swaps Caps and Floors provide price protection but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements They are commonly thought of as price insurance ie for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices Floors are the opposite of Caps they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential With a Cap or Floor the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor There are no potential future costs related to price movements Spread 7 Cap End-User example CropFood a manufacturer of urea wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases but is expected to pass on decreases without delay To distinguish itself from competitors CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go And to sweeten the deal CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced no questions asked The prospect likes CropFoods straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1000 tons of urea per month In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the companys margins at risk to rising prices CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at 120ton for 12000 tons per month The cost of the cap is 2ton chart 3 DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT         CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices         Enron receives a 2ton premium from CropFood for the 120ton price cap         If the market price for ammonia goes above 120ton in a given month Enron will pay the difference to CropFood If prices are less than 120ton CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock         The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of 120ton plus the 2ton premium paid for the cap         CropFood has for a known cost of 2ton captured new business by meeting the customers price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process Spread 8 Floor Producer example AmmoniaKing a producer of ammonia anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time The floor price is set at 145 and costs 3ton The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is 150000 50000 tons multiplied by 3ton chart 4 EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR         AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market floating prices         Enron receives a 3ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the 145ton price floor         If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the 145ton floor price there is no action under the floor contract The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the 3ton premium         If the floating price goes below the 145ton floor price to 140ton for example AmmoniaKing will receive the 5ton difference from Enron In this instance AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is 142ton - the 145ton floor price less the 3ton premium         In summary the price floor has established a minimum price of 145ton with full upside potential at a known cost of 3ton Spread 9 Your sales profits and cash flows are too important to be left to todays volatile market Call us today to shield your income statement from price volatility Working together we can develop a alternative price protection plans so that you can choose one that makes sense for you and brings value to your organization To begin exploring your options with Enron call Doug Friedman Director of Petrochemicals Risk Management Group Marc Distefano or Rob Krotee at 713-853-5592 disclaimer 2001 Enron Corp Enron and the Enron logo are registered trademarks and Endless possibilities and EnronOnline are trademarks of Enron Corp or one of its subsidiaries back cover Logo Endless possibilitiesTM 1400 Smith St Houston TX 77002-7361 713-853-5592

and most of these funds - are set up Normally the funds have at least two separate entities one onshore and one offshore so that they can attract both US and overseas investors We have separate ISDAs w each fund yet in practice the fund manager will trade say 100 lots which is then split in some way between the two funds While this works in practice right now with the funds calling in and us executing orders it would not work at present on EOL unless they traded as separate entities Because one managertrader usually trades on behalf of both entities he would have to be clicking on two separate EOL screens to trade When I spoke w Larry 2 weeks ago he asked whether the funds could trade on EOL through only one of the two entities I brought this up w them and the reply was that its not possible The reason is that the funds are set up legally according to certain guidelines one of which is that trades are allocated among the various funds according to capital in each fund To put all of one trade in one fund would violate those guidelines as the manager would be favoring one class of investors - say foreign ones if it were only the offshore fund that traded on EOL - over another by putting all of one trade in one fund If the trade was a winner the foreign investors would benefit more than domestic ones If its a loser it would be the other way around The way were proceeding to work around this is to draft an a legal agreement that basically gives one entity a superfund the ability to trade on EOL on behalf of all the funds with which we have ISDAs We have spoken to the funds about this as well as to Dan Diamond and Savita Puthigai from EOL and all have agreed that this is the best way forward There are two funds that we deal w which have only one entity which would make transacting on EOL much easier One of those - Harvard - already has transaction rights on EOL Harvard however is not going to be a flow customer which is why I noted above that Tudor is really the first fund that will transact regularly on EOL Harvards focus is longer term and typically more option-oriented The one thing they might trade on a more frequent basis - as I mentioned to Larry - is the WTIBrent spread Other funds have expressed interest in seeing this product online as well The second fund we are still negotiating an ISDA with but that should be signed within the next 2 weeks As you can see the funds are not all set up the same way Moreover many have different focuses - ie short-term longer-term fundamentally driven technically-driven etc Some are also restricted by their charter from trading prompt-month instruments Our goal is to get all of them set up on EnronOnline but not all of them will be flow customers All the funds currently have guest IDs on EOL We worked an arrangement w Dave Forster and Mike Bridges of EOL under which the funds guest accounts are good for 2-6 months So the funds are seeing EOL prices and we very often transact on those prices - at this point more on the gas side than crude However recent trades we have initiated on the crudeproducts side - for example a Cal02 fuel oil crack - have been done bc a fund has seen the price on EOL Moreover trades we pitch are often referenced to EOL prices so that the funds can monitor them for their desired levels Chris Glaas has visited many of the funds to pitch his EOL DFL product which would allow them to more easily and transparently play in the Dated Brent market So has Andy James from the shipping group who was pitching both dry bulk cargo and wet tanker route markets on EOL When we last spoke Larry introduced me to the TAS gasoline product Were definitely interested in the new products that are out there and are happy to talk to the funds about specific ones As far as internal problems the only one we have is the lack of adequate numbers of legal staff to draft and negotiate ISDAs and these EOL omnibus agreements w the funds ENAEGM has assigned one lawyer to us - Frank Sayre - and he is also saddled w other responsibilities so that his time is very constrained Just to summarize as far as status on EOL all the funds except Harvard have guest IDs for EOL We have signed ISDAs w five and are negotiating ISDAs w seven more In addition we are in discussion w two other funds Three of the funds - one with which were negotiating an ISDA and the two with which were in discussion - are program black box funds Our specific pitch to them was EOL as it has more transparent pricing and often tighter spreads than they see on the floor Of all the funds these we expect would provide the most flow business to EOL Sorry for the long explanation to a short request - if you have more questions Id be happy to discuss them over the phone Im at 212 702 3914 Regards Russ -----Original Message-----From 	Leach Doug Sent	Tuesday July 24 2001 222 PM To	Dyk Russell Cc	Gagliardi Larry Subject	hedge funds Where does the Enron NYC office stand with get the hedge funds signed up to use EnronOnline for crude and products Could you please give us a list of the funds and the status of each regarding EnronOnline If there is a legal or credit problem with getting them set up would you please identify who or where that internal problem is

exactly the same as any other product  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc But not an advert - actually posting the turbines Louise -----Original Message-----From 	Richter Brad Sent	Tuesday August 28 2001 239 PM To	Kitchen Louise Cc	Webb Jay Subject	RE eNYMEX Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent  Short answer-- weve got it as covered as possible for now Another item  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets  Im told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle so to speak  I think it fits well for the turbines but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development Brad -----Original Message-----From 	Kitchen Louise Sent	Tuesday August 28 2001 834 AM To	Piper Greg Leach Doug Cc	Richter Brad Webb Jay Subject	RE eNYMEX I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this -

relevant Enron affiliate eg ECTRIC to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate 2 Online transactions - see Justins mail below The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate eg ECTRIC The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legalcredit issues  However isnt this only the tip of the iceberg  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty  From my time in London it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory SFA issues Please comment Also as a commercially efficient course of action It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to train our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub at

the funds have an ISDA only w ENA and not w ECTRIC so they and I assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ENA To satisfy both parties desires all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA Sara from speaking to you and from Justins response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ENA in Houston okays w the counterparty on ENAs behalf However there seem to be 2 other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this As Sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and time-consuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option From the credit side as we understand it the issue w not back-to-backing the trades w ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in Houston and therefore not monitored In other words any exposure not sitting w ENA will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will  be incorrect From the EnronOnline side as we see it there are a couple of issues EOL wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online However they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based Also they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTIBrent crude oil spread online If neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate ISDA w ECTRIC which potentially means as above more onerous and time-consuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL We can assure you that they will not accept this These are the issues as we see them from the origination side There may be other issues that were missing from the sides that Ive mentioned as well as the tradingback office side Regards Russ -----Original Message-----From 	White Bill Sent	Thursday September 27 2001 332 PM To	Dyk Russell Subject	FW Trades as ENA -----Original Message-----From 	Sharma

July 2001 1929 To	Beyhum Maya Boyd Justin Cc	Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Subject	RE Trades as ENA I assume that these are financial transactions The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - ie trade between ECTRIC and ENA trade between ENA and third party eg Bank of America It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC To avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC arranged by EEFT instead of ECTRIC effective 1 November Regards Janine -----Original Message-----From 	Beyhum Maya Sent	25 July 2001 1413 To	Juggins Janine Boyd Justin Cc	Sharma Shifali Subject	Trades as ENA Hi I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA eg Bank of America As a result if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader who trades under ENA and Bank Of America The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office We were wondering about a couple of things Are there any taxlegal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration Thanks for your help Maya

how much is it and do we have that money Its not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties  That is if we have given an aggregate 200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate 100 million credit line to in the money counterparties will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers  If we go to 100 collateral requirements for all participating transactions this is solved since there cant be a mismatch  Will customers agree to 100 collateral requirements - ie no credit lines Once the supportedparticipating portfolio is out of the money Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC  If we fail VMAC can default all participatingsupported contracts When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this -----Original Message-----From 	Kitchen Louise Sent	Tuesday November 27 2001 1003 AM To	Taylor Mark E Legal Subject	FW VMAC Transaction -----Original Message-----From 	Eichmann Marc Sent	Wednesday November 21 2001 251 PM To	Kitchen Louise Lavorato John Cc	Richter Brad Subject	VMAC Transaction Louise and John Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation-FSA Financial Securities Assurance FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal Here are the deal highlights FSA would wrap Enrons credit exposure as follows 1 In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions 2 In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100 collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position 13 billion as of today and the net mark to market position  14 billion to date Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts Please find enclosed the following 1 Transaction structure  	Describes the payment logic in case of default 2 Terms and conditions 	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract 3 Collateral Haircuts  		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position if out of the money 4 FSA snapshot 5 FSA rating 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moodys Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this Marc Eichmann Work 713 345-8422 Cell 713 870-2696 Manager Transaction Development EnronOnline LLC  File VMAC Transaction structuredoc    File VMAC Term and Conditionsdoc    File Collateral Haircutsdoc    File FSA snapshotdoc    File FSA ratingpdf

 70000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz PLC and discharges Corpus Ch risti - described as caribs to USG The flat rate ws100 published by WorldScale ws for the year 2001 actual voyage PLC to corpus is 510 pmt  As u can see by the last posting M ay 11th for route T9 the exchange is calling it a ws162 market If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190  and the market stayed at the 160s level you would be making 30 points on t he 510 pmt flat which 3D 153 pmt x 70000 mt cargo 3D 107100 USD vi ce versa if you bought at ws 190 The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7  North Sea to Cont  We have a trading department here that sh ould have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it p ertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight  In addit ion we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude m arket particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems 90 of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75 of the  international owners have commercial representation in the States Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months ti me - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any mar ket when broken down  For example SupplyDemand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23  boats that can make the different dates and if only 10 of those boats are  acceptable by the majors or anyone else that is worried about spill liabil ity sanctions combined with a herd mentality that trades on a last done philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexic o where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days 70000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500000 bbl ma rket  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 733 bbls pmt hence 733  x 70000 mt 3D 513000 bbls This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market caribs to usg whe re the refineries are because they are the biggest boats you can get into  most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft LOA etc   This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in but allow s the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider rang e of buyers  When the big boats VLCCs very large crude carriers usua lly 2 million bbl plus boats come to the USG from the Persian Gulf West A frica North Sea etc they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered o r off loaded to 70000 mt boats to then bring the crude in  I apologize i f this is remedial for any readers  In any event when the USG sees a surg e in big ships coming west to the states the 70000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to  get tight which means rates will swing hard  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos pmonth for the carib s or the T9 route  For the most part the breakdown is as follows  Mexico Cayo Arcas Pajaritos Mayan Isthmus Olmeca crude - mainly domin ated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they del iver them cpp from the USG  Citgo has a few as does Valero who will proba bly have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining Orion  Coastal Fina Conoco Koch Chevron etc 20 Venezuela Puerto la Cruz Amuay Puerto Miranda la Salina Bajo grande e tc players are PDV Lyondell BP ExxonMob Conoco Orion Coastal etc Columbia -  same players We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns Why would this work here in the States With the recent surge in volatility  a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their asss handed to them  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading  S ome of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such  as contact of affreightments COAs  For example Lyondell has a CO A with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month that totals 6 move s pmo for 2 years  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point for mula off Mardata Lloyds register which they in turn can hedge with Online 20 Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if h ave an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flo ws  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it t o the market - unfortunately for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to d eal with on physical vessel trading  In addition the freight people are n ot going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line t hat trading Department Heads might have In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced mu ch more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001 A combine d result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rat es which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well a s limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any s upply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems pmonth with the vens In addition we had more spot biz  with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast SA merica  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once aga in be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far i n ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets The US broker MJLF particularly Bob Flynn has been trying to get this o ff the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Cit ibank  Reason being Citibank wasnt calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint as was the case with mjlf but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership  FIynn presen tly has a seller for 2 voyages pmonth starting in July  The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so theres a lot of middle ground to get this done  This is alwa ys the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals con cluded overall Flynn whose motivation is commissions can be viewed as either a competito r of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment  For it would b e in his best interest for there to be high activity and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be eas y to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel  If this was  to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futu res rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are be ing done off of different pricing scenarios ie- months average- specific  day closes first half2nd half etc -- if it became so big that sellers w erent just owners and bids werent just charterers but more of a global bo ok balancing tool who knows what can be done  The last time we tried to g et this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the grou p who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen I believe it lost mo mentum with legal  Since London has been able to get it going under the di rection of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here  Scott  advises me that he has the supportinfrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to  pursue this and get it on the website I am by no means trying to pass the  buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the fre ight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explai ning worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London

Juggins who works in the Enron Europe Tax Dept  I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side  She is going to call me at 4 pm Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date  Also one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC rather than ECTRIC beginning 1 November  I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon After reading the attached e-mail string I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA  This assumes of course that 1 the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday and 2 the New York or Houston office rather than the London office is executing and confirming these transactions  We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn  Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions  Also based on the attached e-mail string it looks like were trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and  OTC contracts  Were you aware of this I will give you a call shortly to discuss Best regards Susan -----Original Message-----From 	Juggins Janine Sent	Tuesday

Trades as ENA Are multiparty ISDAs a real option  This seems like the simplest solution If not I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such each risk is laid off to the respective books In this case a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund and then ENA lays off the relevant risk in the WTIBrent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours  Russell do the hedge funds operate only out of New York or would they operate out of London or other European offices also  I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be To clarify using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence assuming that traders continue to be based in London Since a significant proportion of Enrons total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost Regards Janine -----Original Message-----From 	White Bill

follow the novation route ie 1	CP trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC This does mean that the CP must initially accept the European EOL GTCs though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA

Caroline Zivic Robyn Diamond Daniel Radous Paul Lebrocq Wendi Sharma Shifali Subject	FW Trades as ENA Everyone -Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs We just did two WTIBrent crude oil spreads today one w very large volume and expect to be doing more such deals This is more than just a legal issue its going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well As we understand it the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w ENA and not w ECTRIC so they and I assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ENA To satisfy both parties desires all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA Sara from speaking to you and from Justins response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ENA in Houston okays w the counterparty on ENAs behalf However there seem to be 2 other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this As Sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and time-consuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option From the credit side as we understand it the issue w not back-to-backing the trades w ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in Houston and therefore not monitored In other words any exposure not sitting w ENA will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will  be incorrect From the EnronOnline side as we see it there are a couple of issues EOL wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online However they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based Also they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTIBrent crude oil spread online If neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate ISDA w ECTRIC which potentially means as above more onerous and time-consuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL We can assure you that they will not accept this These are the issues as we see them from the origination side There may be other issues that were missing from the sides that Ive mentioned as well as the tradingback office side Regards Russ -----Original Message-----From 	White Bill Sent	Thursday September 27 2001 332 PM To	Dyk Russell Subject	FW Trades as ENA -----Original

	Juggins Janine Sent	25 July 2001 1929 To	Beyhum Maya Boyd Justin Cc	Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Subject	RE Trades as ENA I assume that these are financial transactions The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - ie trade between ECTRIC and ENA trade between ENA and third party eg Bank of America It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC To avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC arranged by EEFT instead of ECTRIC effective 1 November Regards Janine -----Original Message-----From 	Beyhum Maya Sent	25 July 2001 1413 To	Juggins Janine Boyd Justin Cc	Sharma Shifali Subject	Trades as ENA Hi I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA eg Bank of America As a result if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader who trades under ENA and Bank Of America The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office We were wondering about a couple of things Are there any taxlegal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and

a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication  I havent seen the IITRA publication so cant comment on how their quotations are denominated  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description the Floating Price is defined to be the Index  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices calculated using the Worldscale Assessments  Do I have this all wrong -----Original

HoustonLondonSingapore language for freight swaps should be consistent Here are my comments on the Singapore product which I drafted in consultation with Paul HenkingPat Markey who would be trading the product here  Your views would be most appreciated 1	1st para  as arranged by Enron Europe Finance  Trading Limited would not apply to Singapore and therefore not included 2 	Index defininition a	In the 1st sentence I think reference should be to the arithmetic average of quotations instead of the arithmetic average of the prices to be consistent with the other swap products Singapore has on-line This also distinguishes between a quotation which is an IITRA published quote and price which in existing EOL products refers to the bidoffer price on EOL b	I understand the bidoffer prices on EOL for freight swaps are quoted in Worldscale or WS values instead of US hence the 2nd last para which reads  The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume expressed as Worldscale or WS which shall be the Contractual Currency c	Since both quotations and prices are Worldscale or WS values ie a flat rate determined by the route X the daily variable rate I have expressed it as The flat rate expressed as Worldscale or WS used in the quotations and to calculate the price so as to clarify that the flat rate is a determinant of the quotations as well as price d	As identified in the Houston product Worldscale is published by Worldscale Association London Limited and Worldscale Association NYC Inc e	Traders here have picked the last day of the Determination Period as the day to determine the flat rate ie WS instead of Transaction Date to avoid issues which may arise from WS amendments occurring in the middle of a Determination Period  eg whether to take a weighted average when calculating the arithmetic average or would the prevailing rate apply for the whole Determination Period or between Transaction Date and Effective Date in the case of forward transactions Since the flate rate effective on the last day of the Determination Period was chosen I left out the language which appears in the HoustonLondon product  including any relevant forthcoming amendments published prior to or on such date which may become effective prior to or on the last day of the Determination Period  I also didnt entirely understand the reference to including and whether it was intended to mean that all the flat rates will be taken into account weighted average or just the prevailing one I understand from Robert that when the London product was drafted it may not have been brought to Legals attention that the flat rate may be amended albeit unlikely anytime during the year in addition to the annual amendments Attached for your easy reference is the draft Singapore product long

DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step  1 through 6  or you will loose out on a majority of your profits Once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it Remember this method has been tested and if you alter it will NOT work  People have tried to put their friendsrelatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money But it does not work this way Believe us and Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed Because if you do it will not work for you Remember honesty reaps the reward ---------------------------------------------------------------------------1 After you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and REMOVE the name  address of the person in REPORT  5 This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune 2 Move the name  address in REPORT  4 down TO REPORT  5 3 Move the name  address in REPORT  3 down TO REPORT  4 4 Move the name  address in REPORT  2 down TO REPORT  3 5 Move the name  address in REPORT  1 down TO REPORT  2 6 Insert YOUR name  address in the REPORT  1 Position PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name  address ACCURATELY Take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data To assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going METHOD  1 BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY THROUGH A COMPANY LIKE ASTRO LEADS 360-358-3471 Lets say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5000 e-mails each Lets also assume that the mailing receive only a 02 response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 02 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5000 each Continuing with this example you send out only 5000 e-mails With a 02 response that is only 10 orders for report  1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5000 e-mail each for a total of 50000 Out of those 50000 e-mails only 02 responded with orders Thats100 people responded and ordered Report  2 Those 100 people mail out 5000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails The 02 response to that is 1000 orders for Report  3 Those 1000 people send out 5000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out The 02 response to that is 10000 orders for Report  4 Those 10000 people send out 5000 e-mails each for a total of 50000000 50 million e-mails The 02 response to that is 100000 orders for Report  5 THATS 100000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH50000000 half million Your total income in this example is 1 50  2 500  3 5000  4 50000  5 500000  Grand Total55555000 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL  PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100000e-mails each or more There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting Believe me many people will do just that and more ---------------------------------------------------------------------------METHOD  2  BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you start with Method  1 and add METHOD  2 as you go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered Thats it Always provide same day service on all orders This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report  AVAILABLE REPORTS  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY Notes 1 Always send 5 cash US CURRENCY only for each Report Checks NOT accepted 2 Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper 3 On one of those sheets of paper Write 1 the NUMBER  the NAME of the Report you are ordering 2 YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and 3 your name and postal address In case of e-mail difficulties  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW  REPORT 1 The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net ORDER REPORT 1 FROM Hi -

I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements In order to ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible certain elements of the physical metal Master Agreement for example conditionality of TransactionsCall Options on hedging may have to be included in a separate side letter - To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this transaction I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master Agreement - These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject to their comments 2 Master Agreement - As the Commodities will not be exchange traded I have introduced the concepts of Reference Price and Pricing Date which are similar to those contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions - Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactionsexercise Call Options on non-Business Days - I have where possible avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the Forward Sale Agreement However one aspect of the Agency Agreement that does remain in the Master Agreement is that of Agency Costs which is in some instances an intrinsic element of pricing This will need to be discussed - I have removed the concept of Minimum Value which I understand will not form part of this transaction - I understand that due to the nature of the Commodities there may be an imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered Although the consequences of this need to be discussed I have introduced provisions to cater for this see Clauses 43 and 555 3 Forward Sale Agreement - I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the Agency and the Master Agreements - The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed - I have removed Credit Support Default as an Event of Default 4 Agency Agreement - As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this transaction Kind regards Deepak Deepak Sitlani Linklaters London A member firm of Linklaters  Alliance Tel 44-20 7456 2612 Fax 44-20 7456 2222  httpwwwlinklaterscom  httpwwwlinklaters-alliancecom This message is confidential It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal rules If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system you should not copy the message or disclose its contents to anyone

I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements In order to ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible certain elements of the physical metal Master Agreement for example conditionality of TransactionsCall Options on hedging may have to be included in a separate side letter - To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this transaction I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master Agreement - These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject to their comments 2 Master Agreement - As the Commodities will not be exchange traded I have introduced the concepts of Reference Price and Pricing Date which are similar to those contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions - Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactionsexercise Call Options on non-Business Days - I have where possible avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the Forward Sale Agreement However one aspect of the Agency Agreement that does remain in the Master Agreement is that of Agency Costs which is in some instances an intrinsic element of pricing This will need to be discussed - I have removed the concept of Minimum Value which I understand will not form part of this transaction - I understand that due to the nature of the Commodities there may be an imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered Although the consequences of this need to be discussed I have introduced provisions to cater for this see Clauses 43 and 555 3 Forward Sale Agreement - I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the Agency and the Master Agreements - The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed - I have removed Credit Support Default as an Event of Default 4 Agency Agreement - As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this transaction Kind regards Deepak Deepak Sitlani Linklaters London A member firm of Linklaters  Alliance Tel 44-20 7456 2612 Fax 44-20 7456 2222  httpwwwlinklaterscom  httpwwwlinklaters-alliancecom This message is confidential It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal rules If you have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system you should not copy the message or disclose its contents to anyone
