Phillip,

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition
I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be
the best way to handle it.

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.


Sincerely,


Greg Thorse

There are two additional items involving the sale that she is requesting.

1.  She wants to transfer the pay phone account
2.  She wants reimbursement for the bills that I am faxing to you.

I will talk to her again about the check that she sent.

We need to work on getting the pay phone transfer, and the small outstanding
bills.  Let me know what I can do to help.

Ray,

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California"?

Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Corporation

El Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000

HOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news), announced today a binding open season for 320 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.

The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.

The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.

``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.

Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

Richard,

I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  

Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  

Thank you for your help.

Subject:	RE:

Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

Jacques,

Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a  corporation.  Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.  Therefore,  we are ready to finalize the agreements.  What is the next step?  Do we just execute the copies we have?

I haven't heard anything else on the stagecoach from Kevin Kolb.  I keep leaving messages.

Jean,

Congratulations on being team leader for the video.  

Here are some ideas:

1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)
2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.

Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today.

Kirk,

I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled "Introduction to Risk Management" and the second section is "Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

Phillip

Mike & Tony,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing the
settlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaves

I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline may
have been slowing the process by not giving him info.

You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he does
not make contact by tomorrow.

Also, Pauline wants to know if you have any info. on a contact name for the

Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.

Subject:	Please Reply by Wednesday, 8/22 -- Draft Rehearing Request -- FERC Reporting Requirements for California Sales

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

Rick,

Here is the table to insert during Oxley's introduction.  Maybe you could flash to this screen while he speaks.  If you can read my notes, the second Oxley intro has a better audio reference to the skewed distribution.  That might be useful.

 
Can you send me an email confirming receipt.

This note is to give you my feedback on Jeanie Slone.  

She has been extremely helpful with all personnel issues during the last six months.  Without exception she has satisfied any request I have made of her.  She has done an excellent job dealing with performance reviews (both good and bad), salary, and title issues.

Pam please review.  I don't want to misrepresent your position to Greg.


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

I want to personally thank you for supporting the BRM deal and I look forward to working with each of you to make this deal a success. I have provided the email below for your information.  The current next steps are as follows:

Yevgeny & I will meet with Vince Kaminski (tomorrow) to get his support as an Exec SME and get his nominee for content SME;
Phillip will provide his nominee for content SME (by tomorrow);
I will contact both Phillip's & Vince's content SME nominee (By Wednesday); and
All SME's will meet and have a demo provided by Accenture. (as soon as possible and feasible based on schedules)

Thus the SME picture should look like  this

Exec SME's : Phillip, Vince, & John
Content SME: Dutch, Phillip's Nominee, Vince's Nominee, Mark Reese and a structuring nominee (Phillip can you provide me with your suggestions again, Thanks)

If you have any questions contact me at your convenience.

Again Thanks!

Kirk, here are two documents I have revised, assuming a start date for the
week of August 24 for actual content work/design, not just kick off.  This
slips our delivery into the new year.  Please review and let's talk about
them the next time we meet.  I hope your meetings are going well.


List of deliverables and tentative and aggressive due dates, all to be
revised once we start.  In addition, as we move through design, many of
these deliverables will become unit based to ease our tracking of progress,
but since we don't know how many topics/expert stories... that we are
building, it is difficult to create that tracking now.

(See attached file: Deliverables Tracking 081301.xls)


Here is the revised list I mentioned as our SME goals each week, assuming a
start as stated above.
(See attached file: SME Meeting Schedule 081301.doc)

I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Give me a call and let me
know how things are going.

Tony,

Here is the completed worksheet.  I also attached both a plumbing and an electric worksheet.  

I spoke to Steve Chapman with the panel company in Kerrville.  He has a complete set of plans plus an engineers drawing of the slab.  I let him know that you would swing by and pick them up.  He said he knew Mike.  As I mentioned, Mark Olguin should also have a complete set.  I will arrange for the additional copies to be mailed.

   

Call with questions.

Jim,

Take a look at this spreadsheet.  I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices.  Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties?  The Roma deal looks much better.

Andy,

I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice enough as far as brokers go.  Personally, I am extremely pleased with the transition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done online.  If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

Many thanks

Andy

Sue,

Tim Belden forwarded this message to me.  Can you please add Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Frank Ermis, and myself to your email distribution list.  We are all holding significant gas positions in California and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state.  

With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?  This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.  Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.

Phillip

Just heard this on an IEP call and wanted to pass it along.


SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

Jim,

I read through the data request.  We cannot provide several of the items that they requested.  We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components.  Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.  I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.  Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.  I would  like to review the final product before it is submitted.

Phillip

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors "in smoke filled rooms", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?

Subject:=09Complaint Against El Paso


On Friday, July 13th, a shipper group filed a complaint against El Paso Nat=
ural Gas alleging that the pipeline has oversold capacity into California d=
ue in part to unlimited growth of demands by full requirements customers.  =
The complainants request:

(1) that all full requirements customers be converted to contract demand cu=
stomers at reasonable levels;

(2) a mandatory expansion of the pipeline system to be used to meet El Paso=
's existing firm transportation obligations; and

(3) that FERC prohibit El Paso from collecting demand charges for firm serv=
ice it is unable to provide until such time as El Paso can show that it is =
capable of meeting its firm service obligations.

A Technical Conference in El Paso's Order No. 637 proceeding (RP00-336) is =
scheduled for Wed., July 18, 2001 to discuss El Paso's systemwide capacity =
allocation issues, which will include topics addressed in the complaint.=20

Phillip --

Any interest in sending someone from your fundamentals desk to cover this meeting?  May be a good opportunity to hear from the leading "experts" on the subject.  May want to present a basic outline of our fundamental analysis.

Please let me know.

Jeff - The Pew Center is sponsoring a  2-day workshop in conjunction with an annual summer program held by  the Energy Modeling Forum in Snowmass, CO.  We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.  
 
Thanks for considering,
Vicki Arroyo Cochran
Director of Policy Analysis



   

The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)

Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  "cleaner" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more "dirty" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  

The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Horrible events this week!!  Hope you did not know anyone involved.
Thought I would share my recent accomplishment with you, given you have
pretty much known me since I did my first Triathlon at Cinco Ranch about 4
years ago now I believe.  Did my first ironman last Saturday up at Lake
Geneva in Wisconsin.  Very long day and the hardest thing I have ever done,
but I finished which was my ultimate goal.

I would gladly trade it in to bring back some of the lost souls from
Tuesday, but unfortunately I do not have that power.

Hope everything is splendid with you.  Talk to you soon,

Michelle,

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the "Utility Lines".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.

Thank you,

Phillip

Hey Phillip,

I have gone into travel planning mode and wanted to invite both you and
Keith on a scuba expedition.

Greg, our friend Larry Hudler and I are planning a trip to Fiji January 24th
to Feb. 2nd.  All in, the trip should be about $2,000.  This includes
Airfare, Condo, Diving, Food, and Drink, and maybe a little more drink.

Let me know if either of you can attend.

Horrible events this week!!  Hope you did not know anyone involved.
Thought I would share my recent accomplishment with you, given you have
pretty much known me since I did my first Triathlon at Cinco Ranch about 4
years ago now I believe.  Did my first ironman last Saturday up at Lake
Geneva in Wisconsin.  Very long day and the hardest thing I have ever done,
but I finished which was my ultimate goal.

I would gladly trade it in to bring back some of the lost souls from
Tuesday, but unfortunately I do not have that power.

Hope everything is splendid with you.  Talk to you soon,

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the "stupid regulatory/legislative decisions" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?

David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Phillip

Subject:	Answer 

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

John,

Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.

I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  

I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.

Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.


Phillip

I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an average maturity date of 2020.  

Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective yield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?

Phillip

Phillip,

Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.
$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due on Jan
31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worry
about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value of
your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottom
line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep in
mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close that
position you will probably get put those.

Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also, if
there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such
as duration, maturity, etc.

Steve

Postpone until deal Closure

When I get this info I'll talk with you about it. We're currently about to end Phase 2 (approx 50% completed).

Phillip;

These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at each
spreadsheet for error in logic or other.

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new
projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to
increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to
achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase
the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new
construction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new
construction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,



Greg Thorse

Carlos,

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
Fees&Devel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Jim, 

Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the basic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest in that area:

The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern
Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual rampup to 3 bcf 
75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working)
200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working)
Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County.
Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from Kinder Morgan

This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps which you are welcomed to look at.  Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with the developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest sooner than that.  I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest.  

Do you have any use for this capacity?  If so, at what price?  What would your timing requirements be?  Would you have any other conditions that would increase interest in this capacity?

Thanks for your attention.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time.  Thanks!

Good day. I hope all is going well. 

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 

Good news is that this deliverable and the High level design deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks

Subject:	Topic Framework Updates!


Hi Kirk,

Here are the answers to some of your questions and concerns on the Topic
Frameworks.  These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total
of one hour.

Accounting and Reporting - (1) Deal Flow - <<According to Berney Aucoin>>
there is no difference between an Orginator/Marketer  on the deal flow,
they stated that a deal is a deal and it is the same for everyone.  (2)
Roles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin
support and Commerical support should not be added.  We are concentrating
on the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate
because it is different for every company.  Admin support - answers the
phones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office.

Commodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the
overview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but
wholesale is exempt from fees and taxes.  (2) Industrial, Retail and
Wholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer

Organizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department
communications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function
and Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between
departments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e.,
between roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal
communication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a
trade and reconciling position reports)

Risk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to
"Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines

Swaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under
Protecting Againist Loss.

The note for the references used was included on every topic framework -
*Note: Please note in your assignments when using additional resources
other than the BRM course material and your own knowledge. Please do not
copy and paste from Derivatives 1 or any other resource material. This will

Phillip,

It is looking like we will have to apply for a variance due to a set back
requirement when building over 10 feet tall.  Normal set back is 10 feet.
For every 3 ft higher you go, another 5 feet is added to the set back.  The
garage would be about 20 ft so we'd normally need to be back about 25 ft.
Currently, it's 13 feet.

I'm going to look into what's involved in getting on the agenda for a
variance.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Thanks,

Bob Huntley

Jacques, 

Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note:

Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due:  $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.  For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.

If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.

The amortization schedule is attached.

Jim,

I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.

Phillip

Phillip,

Hope your trip to Kerrville was worthwhile, and you had a chance to
check out the Heritage Building.

I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come
back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about
30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had
designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so
today he released this one.

The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we
have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend
of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn
down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract.

I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can
supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know
soon...we will need to act quickly! With best regards, Jim Wills

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

Here's the forecast that you asked for, updated for reported actuals, mid-Columbia spill participation and an assumption that the current drastic efforts to refill continue through June 10. Not included is the rumored 400 MW-mo of federal lower Columbia spill that's been considered for the May to mid-June time frame.

Why is the body shop being closed?  Why can't it continued to be operated on a reduced staff with out exercise classes?

Subject:	Attention Body Shop Members -- UPDATE on Body Shop Closure

The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck.  However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.  

As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.  

Thank you.

Jeff,

I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets.

Renee,

I wrote "check" as the method of distribution on the form I dropped off last Thursday.  I thought it would be more likely for the distribution to be made off-cycle.  
However, if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit.  Is this email sufficient notice or do I need to do something else?

Thank you,

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

Gary,

Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?  In April you worked up a quote for $20,000.  The dimensions of the house have not changed.  The quote given last week was over $26,000.  Have raw materials and labor increased by over 25%?  I need help understanding this increase.

Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel

Phillip,

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.  I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid.  It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Jim,

Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.  

Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.

Phillip

Phillip,

Hope you are doing well this week, and have great plans for Turkeyday!!
We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our
'83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping!

Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.
Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease
originally. The other two are new.

The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10
years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus
kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income
after it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cash
on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.

We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know
if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will
last long. With best regards, Jim Wills

If you decide to move to Kerrville I know of an excellent builder that I
have worked with in the past.

He has built numerous custom homes in the Kerrville\Fredericksburg area that
are very high quality.  He has excellent long time crews using local German
craftsmen. They do outstanding trim work and framing.  Most of his houses
are Texas style with solid rock walls, standing seam roofs, antique wood
flooring, cabinets, etc.

Let me know if you are interested.

Matt,
As we discussed several times previously, including earlier this week, Nine Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE (Women and Minority owned Business Enterprises), which means that ALL trades need to be approved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement. Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions. 

Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy. In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty.

Jay,

I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(Basis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps for Power.

We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets.  They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidity at each location.  

You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041. 

Thanks for your help.

The application for the variance states that I applied for a permit on October 29th and was rejected.  Do the discussions with the building inspector constitute denial.

Phillip,

We spoke with Ina and scheduled a meeting with you for this Thursday from
10:00 - 11:00 in Room 3267 of the Enron Building.

The purpose of this meeting will be to get your sign-off on the feedback
approach for the simulation. We have outlined, in greater detail than you
and I have previously discussed, what we will provide feedback on and how
we will provide it for each scenario. It will be important for us to get
your input on Thursday because we need to finalize the feedback structure
before we can begin building the course.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at Ext. 5-6676.
Mery

Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review.

Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be =
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t=
he application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression th=
at yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su=
ggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition f=
orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.=
  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new =
space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing=
 play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bord=
ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for =
a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to=
 add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed=
room should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof un=
til you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facin=
g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway =
the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be =
brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitche=
n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b=
e more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b=
ad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di=
ning room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining =
room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp=
loring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest somethi=
ng in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try=
 and sketch out these ideas.

This is a list of common mistakes.  However, as the group works together to create exercises and scenarios for the simulation many additional ideas will be generated.  I don't want to hold up this document.  I just want everyone to be aware that it is not all inclusive.

Gentlemen
Please take  a look at the attached document. Provide me with your final input, if any, in so that I can give Accenture Sign off acceptance. This document includes input Accenture received or derived from yesterday's Design Scope meeting.

Tim do you still want to include on this document the issue around "Not listening to "Customer'/ Misjudging customers needs & risk"? Or do you feel it fits into one of the 8 high level buckets listed in the attachment. 

I request everyone's input by COB, Wednesday 9/26 in so that if changes are needed we can still get final sign off by COB Friday 9/28. Thanks

Jeff,

According to Kevin Kolb, he has a meeting with the Kuo's today to give a final blessing to the release.  He doesn't foresee any issues.  If they are ok with the document, they want to sign and exchange checks in person.  I will be in San Marcos this weekend.  Saturday at 3 PM in Seguin would work well for me.  He is proposing that time to the Kuo's.  How does your schedule look?  It would be nice to finally put this behind us.

Any word on a closing date for Leander?

Subject:	Simulation Common Mistakes

Phillip,

I have attached a list of the Common Mistakes we have compiled for the Risk
Management Simulation. We thought this would be a good starting point for
our discussion of examples and scenarios at next Tuesday's meeting. Any
stories you have related to these mistakes will be extremely helpful.
During the meeting, we can also get from you the names of anyone else who
might be able to provide us with good examples of these mistakes.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Mery

John,

Two items:

1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40
	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.
	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.


 
2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=
 dip" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Gary,

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports." Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)

Greg,

Here is the story with Bobinchuck's bonds.  They are being placed privately with a fund of investors.  The interest is 7.7% with no credit enhancement.  I guess Agape is the 501-c-3 nonprofit.  That's why he has flexibility with the timing.

Chad,

Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk.

Jacques,

Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.  This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.  Don't they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?

I certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled.  Has their attorney contacted you with any revisions?  Is the ball in their court?

Karen,

I interviewed Agustin Leon and Zoya Raynes.  Here are my comments:

Agustin Leon:  Has a lot of experience with quantitative and technical analysis.  Programming and language 
          skills.  If not a trader could be an asset to research group.

Zoya Raynes:  Has already been through Salomon's rotational program.  Her interest lean more towards 
          marketing than trading.  Seems very talented.

I would recommend both candidates for further consideration.

il via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c=
onfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m=
igrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your=
 web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

er id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.=
  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. ("OEI") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. 
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. 
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. 
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. 
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. 
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.

Phillip;

These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at each
spreadsheet for error in logic or other.

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new
projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to
increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to
achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase
the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new
construction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new
construction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,



Greg Thorse

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

Sincerely,

Mel Nelson

Agreed. The generator motion is very complete so it would seem to me that our pleading in support can be very short.

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Kirk,

What is the deal with this boat trip?  Seems too extravagant and wasteful.  I am not comfortable with this.  Can't we just have a small happy hour once the project is complete?

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know.

Michelle,

I have executed the Warranty Deed, First Amendment, and the Escrow Agreement.  I am waiting for the agreement that replaces paragraph 7D in the original Escrow Agreement.  Once you email me that document, I will execute it and overnight all 4 documents to you.

Phillip,

I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing both
the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First Amendment.
Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make sure
that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also enclosed
is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the version I
e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of "June 29, 2001" as the
date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee.

Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address described
below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at (512)
370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck at (512) 703-5000.  Thanks.

Jeff,

I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.

In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.

I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.

I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Phillip

I spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.
However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownership
interests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.
(per her attorneys advice).  She is ready to sign the settlement, but she
has not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court.

I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes the
transfer.  If it is acceptable please sign and fax to her directly at
830-372-5400.  Please fax to me also.

Thanks.

Phillip -

Thank you for giving us your feedback on the first seven topic outlines.
I've incorporated your thoughts, but was hoping you could take a look at
them since we didn't have a chance to go over them together. The outlines
and explanations are below. Could you respond back by EOD Monday in hopes
for us to send these outlines for Final Signoff?

Lastly, I was wondering if I could stop by (your's or Ina's desk) and pick
up your comments about the last three topic outlines by EOD Monday. Can you
let me know if this is possible?

Organizational Structure.
You  jotted down "Jeff Gosset, M to M, P&L, and Positions". We have an
entire section about Mark to Market in the Risk Management Inputs topic.
P&L statements and Position reports are large sections in the Accounting
and Reporting topic. In addition, we discuss Mid Office in the Overview
page of this topic (org. structure). Is this enough or were you thinking
something in addition to what I just mentioned.
(See attached file: Framework Org Structure_4.doc)

Accounting and Reporting
I've incorporated the areas of  "G&L, cash payments, and reconcilation into
the last section of the outline. Is this what you were thinking?
(See attached file: Framework AR_5.doc)

Once you make the changes to the release, please fax a copy to Kevin Kolb.  I am going to try and meet Pauline Kuo on Tuesday or Wednesday to wrap things up.  In addition to the release, I will need the guarantee and a release of lien for the smaller note.  I will speak to you on Monday.  Hope things are going well with your wife.

Greg,

I typed up this resume from scratch in 10 minutes.  Will it do?  If you work for the same company for 8 years your resume tends to get dusty.
Let me know if I need to beef it up or if I need to include any financial information.

I wanted you to review it before I sent it to Montez.  If it is ok please forward to Montez.

Tim,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

Greg,

I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed t=
he deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreem=
ent.  Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What w=
ill happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since =
the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute=
 an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.

You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me =
previously.  Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not=
 looking at old numbers.  Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of tru=
e costs and expected loan.

Thank you,

Phillip

Phillip,

I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc=
ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=
rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=
 get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=
t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=
ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=
ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=
d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =
is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=
1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=
nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=
 of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=
how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=
r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =
and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=
bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=
 greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=
ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=
ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=
en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=
ts each change will have on your equity and return.

We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=
 had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =
overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=
ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=
ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=
us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.

I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =
final Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.

I just got interrupted in another meeting.  Let me know if there are any qu=
estions today.

Jay,

My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all products.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.

Thank you,
Phillip

Hi Phillip,

simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West power.  Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to just West gas.  Let me know if this isn't what you want.

Thanks!

In each case, the password is the same as the username.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Jacques,

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

Phillip

Phillip, 
      I received a fax of the consent agreement the attorney on the Stage  
Coach transaction sent and a copy of his coner letter to the bank's attorney.  
I called and left a message that I had comments on that agreement and that we  
will only consent if we get the entire transaction including our release and  
the utility issue resolved at one time. I have jury duty Monday and will call  
you Tuesday to touch base. Jacques

Any word on the release agreement?  Have you sent all the comments back to Kevin Kolb?  I can't tell if they are the hold-up or if we are.
I am going to be in San Marcos next Friday.  It would be good if we could have things signed by then so we can exchange funds.
Please email with status update.

Heather,

This is exactly what we need.  Would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table.  In order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions.

Jacques,

Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It also included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to you? Is the language "Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.

Thank you,

Phillip

Jeff, 

The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Phillip

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

?	US-Mexico border reopen, but subject to delays and inspections on US side.  Mexican officials request that Mexican citizens delay trips to the US.


Political Update

International

US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect "state of confusion" to exist for immediate period ahead.

In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. 

Oil Politics

OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident "relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves" in oil policy.

Jacques,

If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all the agreements.  Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday.
I faxed those to you.  Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Payment".  I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.

It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here.  

Thank you,

Phillip

David,

This note is to give you my feedback on Jeanie Slone.  

She has been extremely helpful with all personnel issues during the last six months.  Without exception she has satisfied any request I have made of her.  She has done an excellent job dealing with performance reviews (both good and bad), salary, and title issues.

Greg,

I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  

The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  

The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.

Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?

I will follow up with a phone call.

Thanks,

Phillip

Mike,

Here is my first pass at midyear reviews.  

        

Let me know if you want me to draft something for Monique.  I will make sure that Matt Smith and Jason Wolfe are reviewed appropriately.  That just leaves Susan.

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

Ina,

Gracie finally sent the CPE credit information.  Thanks for staying on top of it.

Is there somewhere online that I can find my YTD wages and taxes withheld.  I know it was on the pay stub from last week, but I threw that one away before I realized I needed the info.  If I can't find it online, can you get payroll to print out another check stub from 8/31.  I need to do some income tax calculations.

Thanks,

Phillip

jacques,

I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.  The total is $7,328.87.  Do you need to incorporate this number is the release  or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.  Do they have an executable copy of the release?  I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.  I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.

Jeff,

JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?  The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.  

Phillip

Greg,

I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  =
First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, p=
art of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors".  I would l=
ike to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assist=
ed living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I hav=
e mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over th=
e next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity r=
equirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest p=
artner like Keith.

Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=
re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=
nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=
cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=
r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=
atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=
ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=
s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =
plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=
ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=
ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of=
 commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=
dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=
cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=
ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing=
 development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=
mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commerci=
al" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=
ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=
h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=
o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. =
 However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=
e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=
se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=
e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=
nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the=
 plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron=
 Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between=
 the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=
n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=
or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=
e area as development proceeds.  "I'd rather say "no' and if someone comes =
us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =
Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=
e curb cut.  "It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=
n there," Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=
e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =
Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =
against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the=
 meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=
l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =
compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=
ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=
g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =
of the city as a whole.  "This is not a victory for one side or the other,"=
 said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to=
 Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City =
of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way." =09

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

Mark,

The planned mountain bike activity is on Beaver Creek Mountain.  Do you kno=
w what kind of trails are there?  There is a break on Saturday after lunch.=
  The trails at Vail sound great.  Hunter and I would definitely be up for =
trying them out.   Let's set it up.  Let me know if you can book a side tri=
p or if you want me to try.

Thanks,

Do you know what they are planning for Mountain Biking?  Hopefully it is no=
t just paved bike trails.  If you and Hunter want to we can schedule a side=

World Cup Championships.  The downhill is awsome.  Let me know.

Michelle,

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the "Utility Lines".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.

Thank you,

Phillip

Greg,

I have been working with Bill Montez.  I furnished a personal financial statement, EIN number, and we worked through a variety of forms.  I am pulling together the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.  Let me know what else I need to do.

I received the final geotech report yesterday.  Let me know what this means.  It did not look good to me.  Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near a PVR of 1".  

Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday.  Darrell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to Bank One just in case?

Still need to look at the numbers once again.  Email when ready.

Talk to you soon.

John,

The spreadsheet below ("Valuation Summary..") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.  As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.

Don,

Jeff Gosset runs the risk management group.  I spoke to him about including a module on how the books work.  He liked the concept and is willing to sit down with you to discuss further.  His number is X37306.  He is expecting a call to set up a meeting.

Phillip

Gentlemen
Please take  a look at the attached document. Provide me with your final input, if any, in so that I can give Accenture Sign off acceptance. This document includes input Accenture received or derived from yesterday's Design Scope meeting.

Tim
Your initial concerns around Processes and Knowledge Acquisition were relayed to Accenture and they stated that these will be addressed in the learning objectives, which will be the more detail backup to this high level documents.

Yevgeny
Your Fundamentals issue was handled by the i.e. notation on this document. In addition, Accenture said Yes that this document is aligned with the Topics Document and will be aligned with the more detailed back up document (i.e. Outline) that will support the Topics Document.

I request everyone's input by COB, Wednesday 9/26 in so that if changes are needed we can still get final sign off by COB Friday 9/28. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Phillip, Carlos and I will try to respond to your request for a spreadsheet in the next day or two (I'll be at the home office in New Braunfels tomorrow). Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probably is gone...I wrote a contract this morning that's now on its way to California for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do it fairly quickly.

Incidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...it's $1,377,550, not $1,360,000.

HOWEVER!! Here's info about another new listing that may be ideal for you; it's a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a really ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reservoir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be around long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to the postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the building is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power boxes a month in the area. It's really growing. Let me know what you think!!

With best regards, Jim Wills

Jerry,

I had a couple of questions about the exchange.

1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?

Thank you,
 
Phillip

We talked to Bob Braden about designing the foundations using the geottech
information that we was done previously so as not to delay the permitting
process. He said that he would do a preliminary design for permitting only
and as soon as he gets the new geotech information showing the actual
borings where the buildings are actually going to go, he will revise his
foundation designs. He is in the process of sending us a revised proposal
showing the additional costs to do this extra designing. Any questions,
please call me. Thanks.

Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?

 

I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?

Phillip;

I see that you talked to Andrew this afternoon so that you have an understanding of where we are on that front.

I am still analyzing the demand/supply numbers we talked about.  I am going to be working in Austin in the morning and San Marcos in the afternoon.

I have a number of things to verify before I feel I can finish the supply/demand question accurately.  I also need to follow up on the permits and see where they are in process, I need to check on Tas review and a number of other items.

Talk to you soon.

Greg T.

Is AMF willing to put up the additional earnest money and acknowledge June 29th as the day they were supposed to close  or do they believe they are honoring the contract by closing on July 18th?  Of course, I would prefer to close as soon as possible.  

I received the fax from the stagecoach.  I am willing to pay any small expenses like the phone bill incurred prior to April 20th.  What is the status of the release and the utility transfer?

The buyer wants to close on July 18 or 19th. According to the contract they
must close one month after all requirements have been met or put up an
additional $25,000 in NON-REFUNDABLE earnest money.  The zoning was approved
on May 29.

However, the official zoning designation has not been done yet and may not
be approved until around the 1st of Aug.  Give me a call when you get back.

Greg,

This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.

Here is a list of questions:

1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.
2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)
3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?


 
This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.

Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.

Let me know what you think.

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject:	Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential
Sensitivity:	Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Thank you,

The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.

The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.  Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.

Phillip

Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay "0" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue "as is" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?


Regards,

Yevgeny

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM "core" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,

Adrianne,

Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.

Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.

Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Phillip

Greg, 

I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office.  The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold.  Let me know what you think of this property.  Also, let me know of any other ideas about replacement property.

Phillip,
 
Could you please do me a favor?  I would like  to read your current title policy to see what it says about easements.  You  should have received a copy during your closing.  I don't know how many  pages it will be but let me know how you want to handle getting a copy  made.  I'll be happy to make the copy, or whatever makes it easy for  you.

Steve,

I need help determining how much margin the short options require.  My account has a value of around $1,400,000.  That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.  I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.  I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.  Obviously, I don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.

Please get back to me soon.

I like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week.  I like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables.  Plus  these seem a little bigger.  I like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen.  The kitchen should be bigger.  You could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen.

Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form #OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.  

I

I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the  lot from when you closed?  I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems above or around the garage area to consider.
 
If you find something and it's faxable, please send  it to my fax at 281-858-1127.  Feel free to call first if you have any  comments.

Hey Phillip,

I have gone into travel planning mode and wanted to invite both you and
Keith on a scuba expedition.

Greg, our friend Larry Hudler and I are planning a trip to Fiji January 24th
to Feb. 2nd.  All in, the trip should be about $2,000.  This includes
Airfare, Condo, Diving, Food, and Drink, and maybe a little more drink.

Let me know if either of you can attend.

Jay,

My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all products.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.

Thank you,
Phillip

Hi Phillip,

simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West power.  Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to just West gas.  Let me know if this isn't what you want.

Thanks!

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Phillip Allen

Is there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented?  Our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets.

Subject:	El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let me know if you want a copy faxed.

I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin.  The call's I am short are way out of the money.  The only positions that are changing very much in value are the Enron shares I am long and the Enron puts I am short.  I would consider closing those positions.  I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's.

Please forward this email to Steve.

Phillip:

Steve and I are inquiring on the email you sent him.  We wanted come up with
a Muni proposal for 1M and take it from there. At this point, we have about
1.3M available but using this full amount would not give us any cushion in
regards to margin.  Let us know if the 1M is OK with you; assuming we can
always go in and invest more into the bond ladder.

Jeff,

In light of the puny VAR allotments attributed to the simulated trading participants, we have decided to graduate Matt Smith from the exercise.  Please advise Kimat Singla it will no longer be necessary to calculate a simulated book for Matt Smith.  Please use his COB 9/25/01 P&L as his official score for this exercise and post his total on the High Score table under the initials MDS.

Thank you,

Phillip:

The target for end of October is 1283. We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.

From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.

The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.

Tim,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
