we should close in a couple of weeks Susan doesnt want to start trying for a baby until after the holidays  The answer to your Calpine question is a little complex but the short and simple answer is the following 1  Although there is a lot of new power coming online most companies are not accounting for the fact that a lot of the old generation will be displaced by the new generation ie the new generation is much cheaper to operate so it will win the battle in the end 2  New power generation has not kept up with the growth of the 80s and 90s - plain and simple this is a fact  However if we go into a long-lived recession some of the growth will erode 3  A lot of the current plans for more generation will not materialize Many companies will shut down plans to build more generation because of fears of over-building  Whoever gets the new generation on the ground first will force the other companies to back off  In the 80s Calpines CEO recognized the fact that there would be a lack of power in the US by the late 90s and into the 2000s  Therefore he bought call options from the major turbine producers GE Westinghouse etc which gives us the rights to a large portion of the turbines that are currently being built and will be built over the next few years -----Original Message-----From Kuykendall Patrick M mailtoPKuykendallwmcom Sent Tuesday October 02 2001 902 AM To jhadixcalpinecom jakehadixcalpinecom Subject Just curious Importance High Jake What does Calpine see that the rest of the world doesnt when it comes to power   Calpine keeps building-out to produce more power and the so called experts indicate there is a glut of power coming out  I dont understand   Any thoughts I heard you guys refinanced the house    I hope everything is going well over at CPN   Any new developments on the Baby front or are you guys just still practicing  Patrick Kuykendall Senior IT Auditor WM Internal Audit Services 713 265-1216

Suzanne Sperling Tori Cc Tripp Subject Baby Shower for Tripp Hello Ladies Ive talked to all of you and you all have expressed interest in co-hostessing if that is a word Tripps baby shower I just wanted to send out an initial email to let you know where we are and a date     After perusing a calender and talking with Tripp the planned date is Saturday November 10th I know the time between Thanksgiving and New Years is crazy for everyone and right after New Years is cutting it close since Tripp is due Jan 20th plus or minus 2 weeks     It will be a brunch 11-1ish     Tripp will send me an invitation list around October 1st     At this point Tripp is undecided on whether it will be just a girls shower or a couples shower     Tripp is thinking that it may be about 15 people max     The default venue will be my place however Susan has offered to use her place which I may need to take her up on because our living room is really only good for 10 people max Susan are you still okay with that As we get closer I will send out a list of things we need to do and let you pick what you want to do Or let me know before then if there is anything you are dying to do See you soon Pam
