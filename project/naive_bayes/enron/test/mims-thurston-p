Hi Jordan,

Pam called this morning to inquire about the status of the above referenced amendment.  I apologize for the delay on Enron's part in sending this document.  It is my understanding that this is the same document that would be used for the Dynegy guarantee as well.


Please send me a red-lined version of any changes you have and I will personally make sure that legal responds immediately.

I can be reached at 713-853-5772 should you have further questions.

Thanks for your help!

Subject:	RE: What's Been Going On?

Hi Robyn,

How are you?  I hope everything is working out well for you.  I know you had to go back to court last week and I was wondering how that went for you.  Everything here is the same.  The boys are still being "the boys".  They're alot of fun.  Todd is still being Todd.  Although I must say, I think he's getting a little concerned regarding my somewhat "cavalier" attitude.  Nothing seems to really bother me that much any more, because I've made some resolutions in my own mind that work for me.  I guess I better start fussing at him more to get him back on track (not).

I thought for a moment that I might be visiting Chicago again real soon and even contemplated spending the weekend to do some shopping on Michigan Avenue, but I don't know now.  Our company, in case you haven't heard, is really going through.  Out senior management allegedly was involved in some "suspect" deals and joint ventures that have cost this company dearly.  We are suddenly finding ourselves going from hero to zero in a "heartbeat".  Last year around this time, Enron's stock was trading at $85 plus and right now our stock is trading at $11.29.  Just since news of this scandal came out a week and a half ago  (we took a $1 billion third quarter write-down), we've come down  from $30 to $11 (roughly speaking).  It hurts, and it appears that it's all because of 5 or 6 senior level executives.  If this company survives this, it will truly be a miracle.  Pray for me and pray for Enron.

How are the girls doing?  I know they're doing fine.  How's Cecelia?  Tell her we said hello.  How's Uncle Charlie?  Any word when Grandpa Thurston is moving down or is that still on hold?   I know Todd talks to Sherry alot, so I know she's doing fine.  How's the yoga instructor?

I attended the Harlem Dance Theater Production lasts Friday night with a girlfriend.  Interesting, although, I found out I really don't have an appreciation for that ballet "thang".  I was hoping for more "sho nuff" modern dance.  It was interesting, but now worth the $50 I spent.  My girlfriend and I went to a club afterwards....what an experience!  I'm glad I'm not into that scene anymore..rough life!  We stayed a couple of hours and came on home.

The same girlfriend kept the boys overnight on Saturday night and I actually had a free day to myself from about 3:30 that afternoon until I got out of church the next day.  Boy, what a good friend.  Todd was in Austin this weekend, so I was totally free.  I ended up shopping for an hour or so, and came home all excited about watching a good movie on Lifetime, and fell right to sleep.  Didn't wake up until 11:00 p.m.  Oh well, I enjoyed myself regardless.

Talk to you soon!

Love ya!

Here are the numbers:
708-216-8395 (w)
708-386-3558 (h)
630-293-0293 (dad's)

yes the wedding was beautiful.  I didn't think it was going to happen.  Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them  (one from Spokane,WA and the other from Montana.  They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30 hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday.

Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette).

Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is questionable.

I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff.

I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately.

One suggestion (if you don't mind),  come to an agreement on how to disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age.  This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd.

Love, Robyn

So good to hear from you!

Yes, I did drive back to Houston.  I was there on Monday, went to the
conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday,
drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point.  Total,
total chaos, I was so frightened.  The group said we're driving back to
Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed!  21 Hours to
get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's
way.

One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at the
World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to be
dead.  It is just a crying shame!  Also, the impending war.....did you ever
think you would see this in your lifetime?

Incidents of this kind really show you that"tomorrow's never promised".  I
will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first or
second week in October.  I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do you
do?

How was the wedding?  I know it was beautiful!

I'm taking care of myself and living my life.  I do what I can, if Todd
wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys
roll....we can't wait around.

Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received very
good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his
class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff.

Talk to you later!

Love Patrice

P.S.  Please e-mail me your work, and home number, as well as Uncle
Charlie's...I need to program these into my cell phone, so that I have them
at all times, when I'm in the city.

Hey good morning,

How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.

Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be homework.
They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this morning.  I
promised them they'd be in bed by 9 or 9:30 tonight.  I'll see what I can
do.

Tasha,

I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I definitely
know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the kids
for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you and
talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!

   Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I really
   don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He has
   threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
   scared.
   I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so bad,
   and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing to
   do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
   chooses
   not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial difficulties.
   This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I don't
   know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him has
   done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more he
   could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids and
   what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that I
   do
   to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

   Nytasha

What's happening down in your area?  It's very scary.  You just don't know what's going to happen!  It's a crying shame what's happening to Enron.  Who would have ever thought this?

Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could=
 have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I h=
ad a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they ha=
d their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice=
, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.  =
The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45. =
 I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms Thang =
felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal a=
ttire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, =
and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by desi=
gn, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that I bought set it of=
f so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore my rhinestone cho=
ker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, =
but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show al=
l my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When I came out of the b=
edroom after getting dressed, Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Ma=
de my evening.  Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word.  But I fe=
lt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those=
 come out (smile). =20

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd sai=
d the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, b=
ut it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was w=
ondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's b=
ack in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get=
 a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home u=
ntil around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mar=
t.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.  Ri=
ght now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All w=
e do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, ind=
ependent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new=
 environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into sickness.
I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The 4th
grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's dumb
and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter last
night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's not.
She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me so
bad.

Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The best
thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

How's the school search going for Jordan?

Hope,

I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

Hugs

Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours
because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is
he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just
about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially
to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her
or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because she
had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a chance
to.

Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm
very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll
call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

   Hey Tricey!

   I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
   going
   on? How are the boys?

   Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
   yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

   Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday
   but
   she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
   Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to
   you.
   Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer
   at
   4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
   address I have one for her too?

Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class:

The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven

Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL

PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments

Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant)

Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area

For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies,  CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.  The fuel is 2.67%

Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d


Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point

Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only

Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect

Lebanon - often constrained

Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7

We don't have much information, other that the same information that you see.  I would like to say yes, I have a new employer, but it seems a little too early as of yet.

Hi, 

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.  

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.  

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

Hey girl, what's going on?  When are you going to be here so I can clear my
schedule.  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late.  The
visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how to
use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church.
After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again.  So this tells all of
us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job.   The main concern that
is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the
vomiting.  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back over
there to hear what they have to say.  Daddy goes to the new doctors on May
31.  The main concern is the vomiting.  We just have to hang in there and
keep praying.  After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a hard
time dealing with it on Friday.  Everytime someone would ask me about it, I
would start crying.  I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed fine
last night.  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up to
him to talk with Corey.  The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's boss
and ask him about his retirement.  Even though he is eligible, he is not
ready to take that final step.  when junior and I were talking, we wondered
about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned) if he
does not officially retire?   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are.
It is very important that his attitude stays positive.  Enough for now.
Talk with you later.

Hey girl,

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So
little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to
say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena
yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop
trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he
will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to
concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to
seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and
fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was
hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little
bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the
concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several
acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15
p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton
Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates
again.

Talk with you later.

Hi Debra,

Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract (their form of agreement) to add some "netting language".  Please review ASAP and let me know what you think.  I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed, as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us, and have even sleeved some deals for us, when others would not sell to us.

Hi Liz,

Thanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding Alliance and/or Vector pipeline.  This information is extremely important as we are trading this product on EnronOnline without much information.  Also could you please add Lisa Kinsey and Mark Schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the Alliance and Vector gas.  One last request, could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily AOS allocations.

Thanks again.

My contact at Nicor, Mary Hill, says their trader confirmed with you that the price on deal #664380 should be GDD.  Sitara has GDP.  The price that was agreed to between you and the Nicor trader, according to Nicor, was $5.33 on the 10-12, according to our records, we are billing $5.34.  I need your help in correcting this matter.

Hello,

Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.  Was is just Fantastic! (smile).  Any brotha's and sistah's over there?  Hope you had a great time.    I would love to see pictures sometime.  I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.  I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.  It has the gold cap to it.  Also, I would like some black eyeliner.  Just call me whenever you have it.  Also, I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection.

Just let me know when you have it.

Hey girl,

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.  

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates again.  

Talk with you later.

How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your job.  I
was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

I saw "little" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some of his
Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker than
teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take some
getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in when
we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is the
Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

I appreciate all that you have done.  There are 7 days remaining.  I wish I

a challenge.  In that time frame I must finish school and both of my daughters
would have graduated from high school and 8th grade.  The apartment was
bothering me on yesterday.  It was laid on my heart to call her and let her
know everything up front.  She had to run a credit report, you know that is
not good due to the circumstances.  I let her also know why I can not move
until March 1.  Emotionally I wish I could move Feb.1.  Financially I would be
set to move and start my new life of March 1.  I prayed about on last night
and turned it over to JESUS and I am not to worry about it.  I see the lady on
today.  My whole life will be on the move in the month of Feb.  If all goes
well I should receive the package no later than Tuesday.  Keep your head up
about the class.  If you need to pull Hunter to the side and work with him
personally do that.  May be L can help?  Beside missing RC I am okay.

Hey "G",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse
and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this
afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's
on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me,
I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.
Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this
stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its
hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

   evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught
   him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive
   a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

Five Year Price out of January, 2004	=	$3.67 estimate

If you need these prices further broken out by year, please call me.  I will also forward the ISDA and Long Term Gas Purchase Agreement to you early next week.

Thanks

Hi Pat,

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.


P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

You are a mess! That is a shawl sweetie not a bow :o) and it is priced at
$110. If purchased by October 31st, you will get 15% off.

I really hope that Jordan will want to do it :o)

Here is one picture of the bridesmaids dress. I am using two different
tops. Some of the girls will wear the one below and the other girls will
wear a strapless top. The color of them all are Rosebud. My sister will
wear a Rosebud lace outfit. They don't have a picture on the web of the
strapless top or my sister's dress but I can show it to you in a book. The
girls who are wearing the strapless top will also wear the same straight
skirt that is pictured. I am also attaching a picture of my mommy's dress.

Hope, Hope, Hope,

The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go
to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is
that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the
dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about
the cost, I just want to look good!)

What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will
be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain
everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as
well.  That boy is a mess!

Talk to you soon!


P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!

   Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!

   You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress
   but
   the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
   tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

   Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a
   girl
   and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question
   :o)
   Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
   talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to
   walk
   with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with
   the
   biggest smile on her face.

   Love ya!

Yes, I thought we had sent you the contract already.  The actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the Chicago city gates, and not specifically Peoples or Nicor, if I'm not mistaken.  Is this going to be a problem?  I'm sorry, I thought it had been forwarded to you already!!!!

Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.


Talk with you later

Hi Jan,

So nice to hear from you.  I am glad you are finally "enjoying life".  I wish I could join you now.  With the Enron stock and "whatnot", I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated (smile).  Are the boys excited about going to "MDO".  I bet that is a change for them, and alot less expensive for you.

The job is going well, I really like it, it is a different kind of stress, but definitely more preferable for me.  I really like what I'm doing.  My  boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.  Jordan is doing pretty good in school,  I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.   Kendall, what can I say?  My Kendall is something else.  He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!

Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.  Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.  I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.

Anyway, take care

Love ya!

How the heck are ya?  I have been thinking of  you alot lately.  I tried to guess your e:mail address a couple of times  over the last couple of months but there is just no guessing it.  I finally  had to call Laura Vuittonet.
 
Well, I'm having a great time home with the  kids.  I really thought I would be bored by now but I feel just a busy just  not as tired.  In fact, for the first time since I had my kids I feel very  rested and at peace.  It's fun being a kid and  running around Houston  when there isn't much traffic and it nice having the time to slow down the  pace.
 
The boys are in Mothers Day Out 2 times a week from  9:00 - 2:00 which really isn't much time at all.  I could use another day  of alone time.  On those days I am usually meeting with Enron or once in a  while I meet a friend for lunch.  Time really flies.
 
Anyway, I hope all is well for you.  Miss  ya.
 
Janet

Girl, that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned.  I have no idea, all I know is that I don't want to drive for an hour to get to work.  I really wish I could tear down and rebuild where I am.  I love the "hood" aspect of the neighborhood, I love the "colored" folks, and so on.  I need to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what I would qualify for.  All I know, is that I'm not getting any younger, and why not enjoy a new house now, what am I waiting for?  

Girl, I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well, but it has to be done!

Jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 8:30 a.m.  When I answered the phone, I recognized her voice immediately, and I got scared that something had happened.  That heifer called to tell me that Jordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia soft drink (first of all, it took me questioning her three times to find out what the heck Fruitopia meant)  and she wanted to check with me to see if that were true, because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class because it had too much sugar in it......well, I was pissed number one, that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass question.  You are the adult here, not Jordan!  She also said Jordan kind of smarted off to her.....well, take control sister.....you obviously have no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant matter such as this.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!! 

Now on the other hand, Jordan will have to be punished for lying, but my goodness, can you believe it?

Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't in
Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make you
feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?  I
was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang with
the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what all
the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving a
small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but Steve
asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much he
loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He also
apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what.
He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to snuggle
up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He then
jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's
6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just
go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't ask
where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
don't have time for his mess.

So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could
have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they
had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at
6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms
Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that
I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore
my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel
sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When
I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some
pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was
wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's
back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get
a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.
Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All
we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and
new environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

   Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
   extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
   card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
   sickness.
   I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
   still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
   4th
   grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
   prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's
   dumb
   and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter
   last
   night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
   not.
   She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me
   so
   bad.

   Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
   best
   thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

   How's the school search going for Jordan?

Hey Louise,

How are you?  Thank you so much for your concern regarding my son.  He broke his elbow on Sunday afternoon while playing on the monkey bars.  It was quite scary, but his spirits are high again and he seems to be making the adjustment.  

It means alot to me to get messages from you regarding my family's well-being.

Thanks again for your genuine concern!!!!  You're the best!

I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you, and saw my typo!  (you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway, I'm pleased, I know he's not perfect, and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time, but if we grow and learn something from him, and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir, and we're actually proud of ourselves again, it'll work!!!!  Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light!  We've got much greater concerns right now!

Love ya!

P.S. I have a much needed hair appointment tonight, so I won't be home until real late, but I'll have my cell phone available.

Well, Robin isn't pleased at all.  She thinks that he's extremely rude and
arrogant.  I have mixed emotions.  I enjoyed most of his songs, but I won't

Good afternoon,


Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impress=
ion was that Rev. Jackson was resigning.  I called Horace this morning and =
asked him if he resigned and he said, Oh no, he had just made a mistake (I =
get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him o=
ut on him, and Horace being the good, honest person that he is, couldn't li=
e).  He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church.  Robin =
said he was just crying while he was talking.  He said he's in "time out" n=
ow.  I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in "time out" but he kind of kept =
talking.  He said he's really having family problems surrounding this churc=
h thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks.=
  He won't be in the pulpit, he said Gregg would probably have him sitting =
with the deacons.  I asked him what is going on with the deacons,  and he s=
aid it would take all day to talk about that, and he had someone in his off=
ice.  I let him go after that.  Now isn't all of that interesting.  =20

I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday.  She married=
 Tyrone this past Sunday. =20

That revival is this week isn't it?

Talk with you later!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced

was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the

I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know
she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice
conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.

Hey Pat,

I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).

Enron's sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).  The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).  This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.  You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.

Per the contract, Enron uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.

I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.

Let's talk!

Hi Pat,

I spoke with our attorney this afternoon, and he is in the process of contacting your attorney.  It appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to Enron, did not specifically address the agreement that Enron and Heartland Steel entered into.  Long story, short, our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision.

Thanks

Hi Pat,

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.


P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

Hi Dave,


I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m.  My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the  5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".  He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.  I'll keep pushing!  

Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.


Thanks


Patrice

Hi Bob,


Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.  Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.

I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).

Year 2003			$.3.355

Year 2004			$3.45

Year 2005			$3.54

Year 2006			$3.62

Year 2007			$3.71

Year 2008			$3.81

As far as a publication such as PIRA, that Enron would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.

Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.

P.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.

Please reply when you have a moment.

Thanks

Patrice,

  Thank you for the time in answering some I'm sure some of
my questions were witless, but I'll assure you that I can
be articulate, give me alittle time.

If you could, please tell me is there a difference between
the execution of longer and short term contracts?

Answer:  They are generally the same; one of the major differences might be firm or interruptible.  The standard duration for a short term might be day to day or one month or less and the long term would be any trade over 30 days.  In an effort to get started, the ideal contract to utilize would be the "GISB" contract, which stands for Gas Industry Standard Board.  It's just a standard boiler plate contract that "the Board" (comprised of reps from various pipelines, marketing companies, LDC's etc.) put together.  It's widely accepted!  Just double-check on the firmess of the contract.



What is the usual process going from short to longer term
contracts?

Answer: There is no process, it just depends on what type of trade your end-use customer desires.


Can you describe to me in detail what a typical exemplary
trade is like?

Answer: A trade in which all facts/risks were clearly and accurately represented/communicated and the price is commensurate with the type of trade you are providing (i.e. firm or interruptible).

What is the problem that most marketers make with traders?

Answer: Misrepresentation, if you don't know and you are not sure, please communicate this to your potential buyer.  There is nothing wrong with arranging a conference call with you supplier and end-use customer.  We do it all the time, and we don't go around you.  Oftentimes, it gives the end-use customer a comfort level, that an experienced, reputable company is backing you. 

I appreciate your time and you tell me when it's a good
time to go to dinner.


Answer: I'll have to let you know,take care!

Yes, your correct, I'm sure that we are going to have the same issue.  I'm still waiting for the lawyer to respond back to me.  I know he had to contact the Calgary trader to get a resolution.  I'll contact him again today and will let you know what he says.  Thanks for reminding me again!

Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks

Hi Patrice,

I have an issue with Edison Mission and I saw your name on a deal (1094593) from October so I thought I could ask you about it. It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals? Thanks for your help

Have a GREAT Thanksgiving.....you may already be gone......if so, lucky you!!!!

Hi John,

Once again, so sorry about Enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues.

We need to fix the issue, so that it does not occur again, so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute.  I believe Sylvia may have worked on this back in March, and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy, but if you didn't here it is.

Please call if you have further questions.

Thanks

Hi Lizzie,

Will you please have someone re-send the confirmation to Dynegy Canada for May 25th and May 31st.  The sitara ticket Number is 761773.  

I trade on a daily basis with Dynegy Canada and I use them to balance on (a good deal for Enron), so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period.  So as a result, to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations, would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations?

If not, no big deal, it would just make less work for everyone concerned.

Thanks

Hey Missy,

Sorry we missed your call last night.  I was not home and Todd was up to his eyeballs in cleaning up a plumbing problem that we had and still have at our house.  Boy, was I glad I was gone last night.

Alice had invited me to go to a gala that her book club put on last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice, but long.  They featured the poetry and readings of Thomas Melancon.  Have you hear of him, he was there, very good, although I am not a "poetry kinda sistah", but it doesn't cost much to be considerate and supportive of other folks' passion.  Anyway, it was sooooo much fun getting all dressed up, the attire was semi-formal.  When I got dressed and came out of the bedroom, Jordan goes "Oooohhhhh Mommy, Todd says nothing......needless to say Jordan made my evening.  He is really going to be the kind of guy that looks out for his Mom.

As far as Todd goes, I'm trying so hard, I remember you saying "be still" and I have been, but boy it gets hard sometimes.  Alot of times, I feel so confident about breaking out of my own, after all, it could not be much different.  Sometimes my mind says do it now, since the stock markets are down and I am broke at this time (laugh).  Anyway, I'm semi-cool.

What's up with you?  Any more phone calls from Mr. Yoga?  I heard it's supposed to be cool, weatherwise, for you guys over the next couple of days.  When I went over to your Dad's house, Nell said that you had your hard "pressed" for the wedding.  Are you still wearing it "pressed"?  You go girl!

See ya!

Subject:	RE: Hey

Hi:

Sorry.  I got the message, but I've been running for the last week.  The divorce is almost final....I am DIVORCED !!!! YEAAAAAHHH.

I WON SOLE CUSTODY OF THE GIRLS ....YEAAAHHH.

But since Reggie is representing himself, after three hours, we ran out of time.  So we will resume the trial on 10/25, and we will argue over the value of the house, the stuff in the house, and decide how much I have to pay him.  You know I have every little receipt I could find so that it reduces this amount.  But, the final decision on division of the home is up to the judge.  The child support amount will be determined too.

It really doesn't matter, the judge wants the kids to be in the house, and the most important thing, is that I will make all parenting decisions with regard to the children.

Since then, it's been crazy at work, then I was on the program committee for the annual conference of a professional organization that I belong to.  The meeting was here in Chicago, so I spent the weekend and Mon and Tues. socializing with that group.

My "church" girlfriend stook me out for drinks last Friday, and I've been partying ever since.  Patrice, I didn't know how much of a burden that man was to me until that judge said "your divorced effective immediately".
I haven't been this happy since I was in college.

And guess what.....don't tell anyone, I haven't even told my sister or mother this....my yoga instructor asked me for my phone number on Saturday, and actually called me Sunday.  He's 41, divorced , has an undergraduate degree in biology and has the tightest ass you've ever seen.  But, he's short and has a gold tooth.....(and he probably really likes white girls).

that's enough for now.  I got to get some work done.  Talk with you soon.  Robyn

>>> <Patrice.L.Mims@enron.com> 10/11/01 12:20PM >>>

Hey girl,

How are you?  I hope everything is well with you and the girls.  I was
hoping to hear from you this past weekend.  We called and left a message
this past Sunday.  You've kinda got me worried.

I enjoyed visiting with Uncle Charlie and Nelle last week.  It was nice to
see Rayvn as well, she's so cute!  Thanks for the suggestion.  That worked
out well for me.

As for me, everything is going okay for me, I'm just in a mellow mood, just
hangin tough.

Write back!

   630-293-0293 (dad's)

   yes the wedding was beautiful.  I didn't think it was going to happen.
   Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not
   going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing
   money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were
   worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has
   two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them  (one from Spokane,WA
   and the other from Montana.  They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30
   hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got
   there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday.

   Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking
   until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette).

   Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good
   and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is
   questionable.

   I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff.

   I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately.

   One suggestion (if you don't mind),  come to an agreement on how to
   disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age.  This
   will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd.

   Love, Robyn

   So good to hear from you!

   Yes, I did drive back to Houston.  I was there on Monday, went to the
   conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday,
   drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point.  Total,
   total chaos, I was so frightened.  The group said we're driving back to
   Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed!  21 Hours to
   get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's
   way.

   One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at
   the
   World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to
   be
   dead.  It is just a crying shame!  Also, the impending war.....did you
   ever
   think you would see this in your lifetime?

   Incidents of this kind really show you that"tomorrow's never promised".
   I
   will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first
   or
   second week in October.  I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do
   you
   do?

   How was the wedding?  I know it was beautiful!

   I'm taking care of myself and living my life.  I do what I can, if Todd
   wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys
   roll....we can't wait around.

   Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received
   very
   good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his
   class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff.

   Talk to you later!

   Love Patrice

   P.S.  Please e-mail me your work, and home number, as well as Uncle
   Charlie's...I need to program these into my cell phone, so that I have
   them
   at all times, when I'm in the city.

Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home.

With your knowledge, experience, and all those who know you, you would never have to worry about finding another job.  You might have to leave TEX.  But, mirant and elpaso is growing, just as well as AEP and Aquila.  There are a lot of rainbows on you side.  :)  By no means should you ever be worried.

Yes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with you?  How are the proceedings coming along?

Everything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation, whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.

I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?

By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.

Write back!!!!

Subject:	Directions to Tom Bass Regional Park Section 1

Directions to Tom Bass Park from Downtown:

Keep in mind, Tom Bass Park has 3 Sections, we are in Tom Bass Park Section
1, Pavillion #2.

From Downtown take 288  South, Exit 288 at the Beltway 8 Exit, make a left
under 288, stay on the Beltway 8 Feeder Road,
Once you've gone under 288 keep your eye on the right hand side (the
entrance to the park is really close), the entrance to the park is  your
first right turn, you'll see a sign that says Tom Bass Park Section 1.  Go
into Section 1 of the park and look for Pavillion #2 ( there are three
pavillions, Pavillion 2 has the light blue play area, you can't miss it).

Bring your favorite games, lawn chairs, blankets, , bugspray, etc.

Hi Vonda


Even though, I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline, I'll try again on the S. Texas piece.
If my memory serves me right, you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece.


Enron offers the following:



Period:				November, 2001 - March, 2002

Region:				Trunkline South Texas Pool

Volume:			10,000 MMBtu/d

Demand Charge:		$0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times
				the volume, for the right to receive the volumes on a daily
				basis at the Trunkline S. Texas " Gas Daily Daily" price.

Notification Time:		7:30 a.m. 

Thanks

Not as many as we originally thought, Sandie is calling folks the next
couple of days.  We invited about 5-6 families/friends, Marsha maybe
invited about the same. I know Todd had a couple of DYN folks.   When its
all said and done we may have about 40 people including kids.  I'll know
for sure Friday.  Mom and Jackie will be down that weekend so they will be
there.

Hello Clark,


Pat Monahan of CSN asked me to forward the attached gas purchase contract to you for review.  We are currently scheduled to deliver natural gas volumes to CSN's Terre Haute facility for November 1st activity.  As a consequence, we would like to have your comments or approval as soon as possible.

Hi Debra,

Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract (their form of agreement) to add some "netting language".  Please review ASAP and let me know what you think.  I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed, as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us, and have even sleeved some deals for us, when others would not sell to us.

I will be on vacation Tuesday and Wednesday,so I would appreicate your help.  As always, tomorrow I can be reached on my cell if you need me.  

Thanks

P.S. Did you get ahold of Mr. Hunt from Nicor yet.

Hey girl!  Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you last night.  I was in
bed by 9:30.  Steve got home around 11:00 and didn't say a word to me.  He
turned on lights and made lots of noise, but said nothing.  He slept
upstairs in the game room last night, so evidentally, he goes in late
today.  He could've at least dressed and taken the kids to school, since I
do it every morning, but he didn't.  I can't worry about it.  I'm so use to
doing it all by myself anyway, so it really doesn't matter.  What time will
you be at rehearsal tonight?  Maybe we can talk before then.

Hope's number is (713) 207-7103.   Talk to you later!

   know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the
   kids
   for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you

      Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I
   really
      don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He
   has
      threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
      scared.
      I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so
   bad,
      and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing
   to
      do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
      chooses
      not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial
   difficulties.
      This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I
   don't
      know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him
   has
      done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more
   he
      could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids
   and
      what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that
   I
      do
      to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

Hi Gene,

As promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.  These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.  These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing "apples to apples".

January, 2001			$10.99

February, 2001			$  6.61

Mar, 2001			$  5.38

Apr. 2001			$  5.70

May, 2001			$  5.13

June, 2001			$  3.95

July, 2001			$  3.40

August, 2001			$  3.25

September, 2001		$  2.42

October, 2001			$  2.00


I still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis.  Please call me at 713-853-5772 once you have had a chance to review the information and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks

I need your help in correcting this matter.

Thanks

 As an update, there is only one issue remaining concerning the agreement, that being Force Majeure.  Also I am waiting on a revision to Dynegy's Guaranty for Nicor.   I have left a message for Mr. Hunt and await his call.  I think we are there just a few minor adjustments.

Directions to Tom Bass Park from Downtown:

Keep in mind, Tom Bass Park has 3 Sections, we are in Tom Bass Park Section
1, Pavillion #2.

From Downtown take 288  South, Exit 288 at the Beltway 8 Exit, make a left
under 288, stay on the Beltway 8 Feeder Road,
Once you've gone under 288 keep your eye on the right hand side (the
entrance to the park is really close), the entrance to the park is  your
first right turn, you'll see a sign that says Tom Bass Park Section 1.  Go
into Section 1 of the park and look for Pavillion #2 ( there are three
pavillions, Pavillion 2 has the light blue play area, you can't miss it).

Bring your favorite games, etc.

Hi,

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on
Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or
so and come on through to Omaha.

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had
to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some
nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you
stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like
Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom
yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how
everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad
shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not
ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and
not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of
pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so
hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is
any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's
certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if
there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying
for Daddy as well as Mom.

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

   Hey girl, what's going on?  When are you going to be here so I can clear
   my
   schedule.  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late.
   The
   visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how
   to
   use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church.
   After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again.  So this tells all
   of
   us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job.   The main concern
   that
   is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the
   vomiting.  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back
   over
   there to hear what they have to say.  Daddy goes to the new doctors on
   May
   31.  The main concern is the vomiting.  We just have to hang in there
   and
   keep praying.  After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a
   hard
   time dealing with it on Friday.  Everytime someone would ask me about
   it, I
   would start crying.  I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed
   fine
   last night.  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up
   to
   him to talk with Corey.  The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's
   boss
   and ask him about his retirement.  Even though he is eligible, he is not
   ready to take that final step.  when junior and I were talking, we
   wondered
   about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned)
   if he
   does not officially retire?   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all
   are.
   It is very important that his attitude stays positive.  Enough for now.
   Talk with you later.

   Hey girl,

   Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So
   little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to
   say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena
   yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.

   I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop
   trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he
   will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to
   concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going
   to
   seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and
   fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was
   hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little
   bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

   The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However,
   the
   concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had
   several
   acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until
   1:15
   p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton
   Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that
   dates
   again.

   Talk with you later.

      How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your
      job.  I
      was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

      I saw "little" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some
   of
      his
      Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker
      than
      teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take
   some
      getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
      I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in
      when
      we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is
      the
      Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

Hi Pat,

I spoke with our attorney this afternoon, and he is in the process of contacting your attorney.  It appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to Enron, did not specifically address the agreement that Enron and Heartland Steel entered into.  Long story, short, our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision.

Thanks

Hi Pat,

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.


P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late night.

Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

Hey Tricey!

I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been going
on? How are the boys?

Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday but
she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to you.
Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer at
4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
address I have one for her too?

Hey Guys,


I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.

Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Jesus,

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.

I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.  I'm going to look
up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go
together.

I'll let you know what I find out.

   Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after
   you.
   I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
   burning rubber.

   Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
   grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
   she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
   early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to
   pray
   for her.
   How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

   We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to
   Institute
   Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

   I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the
   problem
   was.

   Hey Sister Sims,

   You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
   rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a
   hard
   time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need
   to
   look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

   How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going
   well
   for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for
   Jordan
   and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very
   immature.
   She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

   You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials
   and
   talk.

   Write back

      Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to
   be
      EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo
   crazy.
      Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you
   weren't
      in
      Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it
   make
      you
      feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
      feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

      I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd
   call a
      plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

      I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on
   Sunday?
      I
      was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
      with
      the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
      Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
      all
      the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

      After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was
   giving
      a
      small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
      Steve
      asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how
   much
      he
      loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
      also
      apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to
   Siera
      for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way
   he
      treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her
   for
      speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I
   felt
      like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
      what.
      He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
      snuggle
      up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
      immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He
      then
      jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
      he's
      6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
      just
      go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
      ask
      where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just
   really
      don't have time for his mess.

      So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

      Hey girl,

      What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
      could
      have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last
   night I
      had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
      they
      had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It
   was
      nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their
   at
      6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and
   seating
      at
      6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But,
   girl,
      Ms
      Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
      semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my
   favorite
      stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my
   floor
      length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The
   top
      that
      I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!
   I
      wore
      my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the
   ones I
      wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
      heel
      sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
      When
      I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
      "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
      husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan
   take
      some
      pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

      We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home,
   Todd
      said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
      entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

      Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
      was
      wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
      she's
      back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

      How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe
   we'll
      get
      a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be
   home
      until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to
   Power
      Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
      too.
      Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing
   much.
      All
      we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule
   different,
      independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean
   break
      and
      new environment.

      Oh well, talk with you later!

      Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

         prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
      she's
         dumb
         and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
      letter
         last
         night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because
   she's
         not.
         She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That
   hurt
      me
         so
         bad.

         Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.
   The
         best
         thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

         How's the school search going for Jordan?

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:  

We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

Rob,

I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference to
"must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does make
a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party to
provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand under
a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments where
appropriate.

I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
authority.

Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . " language
to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

All told, most of the changes look fine.

Thanks.

Ernie

Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel?  It is the Westin.  Also, who is Jason and what are HS numbers?  As far as delivery point, yes, it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren (the LDC).  Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements.  Also, I did meet with Jeff Hodge, our attorney, and I know the details regarding the contract.  I'll be in the office until around 10:30.

Thanks

Hi Patrice,

I'm going to get an earlier flight in on Monday. I'll leave Houston at 7:20 and arrive Indianapolis at 9:42. I'll just take a cab to the hotel that night. This is much better so we don't have to worry about being late. 

On a side note--Jason will be calling you regarding some HS numbers. Did you find anything out about the contract and what it says about the delivery point? Are we going to discuss that there? Also, I'm going to try to talk with Lisa Mellancamp and find out exactly which topics are off limits. I know you're leaving Monday, but we'll have time to talk about all this on the drive to Terra Haute.

Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.

Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.

I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.  You didn't tell me how good church was on Sunday.   She said Kathy Florence really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape!  It must have been awesome!

Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?  How are things going with Steve's party and have you set a time yet?  What does he want/need  for his birthday?  I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, socks, etc.)

Talk to ya!

Hey Girl, 

Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!

Hey Girl,

Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be gay, and not he's changed, but......

I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said "the hell with this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.

Talk with you later!

Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     " . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand."

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   "must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . "
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

   Ernie

Fine, I was thinking of you earlier today.  Just had a bite to eat and just sitting here surfing the net.  Looking for some good vacation spots.   just happened to be looking at Arizona for the heck of it.  

How is you day going so far?  Already had lunch?  How did the car shopping trip go on Saturday?

Hi Patrice,

I know it's never going to be a good time to take care of this deal, but we've got to do it sometime. Let me know what time is good for you. Please let me know the payment terms of the new deal, so that I can get with the new coordinator of this account. More specifically, are they still prepaying??? Since the name changed to "c," I will no longer be handling it. Bummer, huh? 

Thanks!

Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help with the kids or anything.

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on Easter.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
 We need to shop together more often.

Yes, I will be at choir tonight.

See you then!

Girl, what is PMO?  I'm doing fine, I just sent Tarsha an e-mail, and I hit the send button and there you are!  Is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations?  I certainly hope so.  I know planning a wedding is alot of work.  Jordan is still excited about walking with Taylor.

I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.

How was your weekend?

See ya!

I heard that Cynthia lost a lot too.

And Fannette has been gone almost a year now.  (Smile)

She's also into Real Estate.

What's Happening?


How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.  Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.

This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.

Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?

Talk with you later!

I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.  I'm going to look up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go together.

I'll let you know what I find out.

Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after you.
I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
burning rubber.

Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to pray
for her.
How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to Institute
Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the problem
was.

Hey Sister Sims,

You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard
time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to
look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well
for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan
and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.
She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and
talk.

Write back

   Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
   EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
   Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't
   in
   Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make
   you
   feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
   feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

   I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
   plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

   I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?
   I
   was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
   with
   the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
   Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
   all
   the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

   After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving
   a
   small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
   Steve
   asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much
   he
   loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
   also
   apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
   for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
   treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
   speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
   like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
   what.
   He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
   snuggle
   up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
   immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He
   then
   jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
   he's
   6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
   just
   go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
   ask
   where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
   don't have time for his mess.

   So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

   Nytasha

   Hey girl,

   What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
   could
   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
   they
   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating
   at
   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,
   Ms
   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
   stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
   length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top
   that
   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I
   wore
   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
   heel
   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
   When
   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
   "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
   husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take
   some
   pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
   was
   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
   she's
   back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll
   get
   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
   too.
   Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.
   All
   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
   independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break
   and
   new environment.

   Oh well, talk with you later!

   Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

      Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
      extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
   report
      card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
      sickness.
      I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but
   she
      still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
      4th
      grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up
   in
      prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
   she's
      dumb
      and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
   letter
      last
      night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
      not.
      She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt
   me
      so
      bad.

      Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
      best
      thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

      How's the school search going for Jordan?

Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.  I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.

Hey girl!  Welcome back!  I had a great Easter with the exception of the
bad news I received late Sunday night.  My cousin (Renee') passed on Sunday
around noon.  She lived here in Houston.  Her husband gave her and her baby
AIDS.  Her husband died some years ago.  Her mom now has her little boy,
who is close to Siera in age.  My 2nd cousin (Kenny), who lives here in
Houston also, lost his wife on Sunday around 2:30 pm.  She was only 22
years old and they have a two year old daughter.  This situation is really
sad, because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty.  The
Saturday before last, Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster.
They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player.  He stated that she was
selfish when it came down to him spending $, etc...  He told me that the
next thing he knew, she jumped out of the moving car.  He was going about
35 mph.  She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries.  She lived
a week and one day.  Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called
the police on him at the hospital.  The police had to escort my cousin and
his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him.
Kenny's wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital, and
the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no.
It's a good thing they have this on record.

I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers.  I can't believe
he's lost that much weight.  He is blessed, and we're praying for God to
heal him.  We're praying for eternal remission right now in the name of
Jesus!  I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren.  You all
alone give him the strength to keep fighting.

Church service was good on Sunday.  Greg sho nuff preached!  However, the
choir didn't sound too good.  Doren was out sick, so Gerald had to play and
direct.  It was aweful.  We were all rocking different ways.  No, we did
not sing any of my songs.  I only made the 11:00 service.  Are you going to
rehearsal tonight?

Well, I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match.
I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the pink
solid shirt.  Honey, I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday.
I missed the wedding, but made the reception.  When I walked in the room,
all eyes were on me.  For once, I didn't feel self conscious about my arms.
My husband was all over me and giving me compliments.  Several of his
cousins told me how good I looked also.  Steve wasn't too pleased about
that.

Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought?

Subject:  What's Happening?


Hello,

How was your weekend?  My weekend was great visiting with my family.
Everyone is doing fine.   Daddy is doing okay.  The radiation treatments
put the prostate cancer in remission, although the Dr. said the cancer
would just move to another part of his body.  He thinks it may have moved
to his leg,  He had a MRI done last week, and today he will get the
results, and he's so afraid he's going to need surgery again.  He's has to
use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went
from 170 to l00.  It's really sad, he is so small and frail.  He's starting
to get his appetite back somewhat.  He sure had a good time eating this
weekend.  My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner.  Please keep him in
your prayers.  It's so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in
everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSED MAN!

How was church services on Sunday?  Did you make it to all the services, (I
don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to all of them, that's
a bit much).  Did Greg show out on Easter?  Anything new going on with the
choir, did you sing any of your songs.  This month is going to be extremely
busy with the revivial and the other church outing.

You know I never did get a  chance to ask you what all you ended up
purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day.

Anyway, talk with you later!

Clinique, it's there new one.  But is she registered under Danielle Crusoe?  They do have a registry, correct.  I'm kinda excited to know what Danielle is registered for?

Hey noonie!

I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your
invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her about
it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two
places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might have
to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there with
something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I have
all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.

What is your favorite mascara?

Hope,

I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the
Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her
then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle
registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church
tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she
registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for
myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my
favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

Hugs

   Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5
   hours
   because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject
   is
   he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating
   just
   about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam,
   especially
   to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

   I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell
   her
   or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because
   she
   had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a
   chance
   to.

   Hey Lady,

   I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
   shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
   Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
   great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.
   I'm
   very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

   Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home,
   I'll
   call you if I do, or just call her for you.

   Talk with you later!!!

   Hugs

      Hey Tricey!

      I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
      going
      on? How are the boys?

      Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
      yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

      Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on
   Tuesday
      but
      she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
      Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it
   to
      you.
      Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on
   Westheimer
      at
      4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
      address I have one for her too?

Hello,

Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.  Was is just Fantastic! (smile).  Any brotha's and sistah's over there?  Hope you had a great time.    I would love to see pictures sometime.  I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.  I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.  It has the gold cap to it.  Also, I would like some black eyeliner.  Just call me whenever you have it.  Also, I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection.

Just let me know when you have it.  

Thanks!

I love Clinique. I haven't tried their mascara but I've been using their
powder for about 3 years.

She is registered under Danielle Crusoe. Victoria doesn't have a registry
but when we went the manager let me write down all of the things that
Danielle wanted and she said that she would make sure that everyone in her
store knew about it for when people came in. I called it "Danielle Crusoe's
Wish List". I must give you the invitation. Her theme is "Around the
Clock". Have you been to this kind of shower before? It wear you bring a
gift that the bride-to-be will use during the morning, midday or evening
hours. I absolutely love during bridal showers they're so fun.

 I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sen=

 FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Custome=

 Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours r=
equesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled du=

must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the=
 last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.=
  A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible=
 Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fix=
ed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which=
 a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original =
Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to=
 the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's ac=
ceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmles=
s for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantit=
y of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quant=
ity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without =
limitation events of Force Majeure.

For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" =20

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,=
 in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo=
graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele=
vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t=
hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u=
nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average=
 of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin=
t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D=
ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d=
etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced=
ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo=
t Price can be determined.

Let  me know what you think.

Good Afternoon Ms. Thurston!!	

   Did you make Tony's party????  I hope you did..........I've gotten several calls from Donnell, however, I was a little under the weather over the holiday and still not doing so great.  I had to cancel my dental appointment today, because I'm sure they won't give me the premeds.  They confirmed when I called.  Anywho, I left your home number with Donnell to call you and give you Tony's home number.

Anywho, I hope you and the kids had a great time over the holiday.  I finally left the house on yesterday to go with Stan to visit his parents.  He had to go to work, therefore I was stuck a little longer than I would have wanted to, we played cards so that helped me a lot.

Anywho, I'm working on performance reviews, not sure what time I'm leaving today, but do call.

See Ya!!

Hey Robert,,

Sorry I was out on vacation, and I did not think to ask Todd the name of his headhunter, but I will and try to get back to you with some names this week.

Take care!

I do not see any problems with the assignment however,  I want to look over the contract and the transactions before I give the ok  because I do not see the contract in our system.  Do you have a copy?

Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

Thanks

Hope, Hope, Hope,

The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about the cost, I just want to look good!)

What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as well.  That boy is a mess!

Talk to you soon!


P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!

Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!

You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress but
the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a girl
and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question :o)
Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to walk
with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with the
biggest smile on her face.

Love ya!

Subject:	Online Launch Plan Update

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power

Hey Sister Sims,

You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.  She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.  

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk.  

Write back

Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't in
Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make you
feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?  I
was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang with
the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what all
the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving a
small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but Steve
asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much he
loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He also
apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what.
He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to snuggle
up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He then
jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's
6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just
go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't ask
where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
don't have time for his mess.

So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

Nytasha

Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could
have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they
had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at
6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms
Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that
I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore
my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel
sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When
I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some
pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was
wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's
back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get
a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.
Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All
we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and
new environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

   Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
   extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
   card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
   sickness.
   I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
   still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
   4th
   grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
   prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's
   dumb
   and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter
   last
   night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
   not.
   She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me
   so
   bad.

   Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
   best
   thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

   How's the school search going for Jordan?

Girl, you're a mess!  Although, you are causing me to smile "in the midst of it all".  You really do need to find this guy.  What's his full name?  Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely, someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go, go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.  His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from this day forward.

Directions to Tom Bass Park from Downtown:

Keep in mind, Tom Bass Park has 3 Sections, we are in Tom Bass Park Section
1, Pavillion #2.

From Downtown take 288  South, Exit 288 at the Beltway 8 Exit, make a left
under 288, stay on the Beltway 8 Feeder Road,
Once you've gone under 288 keep your eye on the right hand side (the
entrance to the park is really close), the entrance to the park is  your
first right turn, you'll see a sign that says Tom Bass Park Section 1.  Go
into Section 1 of the park and look for Pavillion #2 ( there are three
pavillions, Pavillion 2 has the light blue play area, you can't miss it).

Bring your favorite games, lawn chairs, blankets, , bugspray, etc.

Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours
because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is
he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just
about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially
to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her
or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because she
had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a chance
to.

Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm
very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll
call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

   Hey Tricey!

   I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
   going
   on? How are the boys?

   Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
   yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

   Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday
   but
   she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
   Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to
   you.
   Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer
   at
   4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
   address I have one for her too?

Hey "G",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me, I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.  Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.  I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

Thanks

These are the changes that Enron Legal would like you to consider.  Please =
review and let me know if these changes are acceptable. These changes would=
 be be inserted and would replace the sections under Demand Charge, Transac=
tion Default Price, Reference Price and Flexible Pricing.

I know.......let me know what you think.=20

Thanks


Demand Charge for Physical Call Option

Buyer shall pay Seller $0.03 per MMBtu multiplied by the FMDQ, plus fuel, m=
ultiplied by the number of days in the Month of Delivery.

Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option =20

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,=
 in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo=
graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele=
vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t=
hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u=
nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average=
 of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin=
t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D=
ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d=
etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced=
ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo=
t Price can be determined.

FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Customer=
 may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed =
Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours re=
questing any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled dur=
ing selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request m=
ust be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the =
last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month. =
 A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible =
Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fixe=
d dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which =
a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original C=
ontract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to =
the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's acc=
eptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmless=
 for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantity=
 of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quanti=
ty of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without l=
imitation events of Force Majeure.
