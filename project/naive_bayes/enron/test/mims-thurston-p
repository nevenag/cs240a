Whats Been Going On Hi Robyn How are you  I hope everything is working out well for you  I know you had to go back to court last week and I was wondering how that went for you  Everything here is the same  The boys are still being the boys  Theyre alot of fun  Todd is still being Todd  Although I must say I think hes getting a little concerned regarding my somewhat cavalier attitude  Nothing seems to really bother me that much any more because Ive made some resolutions in my own mind that work for me  I guess I better start fussing at him more to get him back on track not I thought for a moment that I might be visiting Chicago again real soon and even contemplated spending the weekend to do some shopping on Michigan Avenue but I dont know now  Our company in case you havent heard is really going through  Out senior management allegedly was involved in some suspect deals and joint ventures that have cost this company dearly  We are suddenly finding ourselves going from hero to zero in a heartbeat  Last year around this time Enrons stock was trading at 85 plus and right now our stock is trading at 1129  Just since news of this scandal came out a week and a half ago  we took a 1 billion third quarter write-down weve come down  from 30 to 11 roughly speaking  It hurts and it appears that its all because of 5 or 6 senior level executives  If this company survives this it will truly be a miracle  Pray for me and pray for Enron How are the girls doing  I know theyre doing fine  Hows Cecelia  Tell her we said hello  Hows Uncle Charlie  Any word when Grandpa Thurston is moving down or is that still on hold   I know Todd talks to Sherry alot so I know shes doing fine  Hows the yoga instructor I attended the Harlem Dance Theater Production lasts Friday night with a girlfriend  Interesting although I found out I really dont have an appreciation for that ballet thang  I was hoping for more sho nuff modern dance  It was interesting but now worth the 50 I spent  My girlfriend and I went to a club afterwardswhat an experience  Im glad Im not into that scene anymorerough life  We stayed a couple of hours and came on home The same girlfriend kept the boys overnight on Saturday night and I actually had a free day to myself from about 330 that afternoon until I got out of church the next day  Boy what a good friend  Todd was in Austin this weekend so I was totally free  I ended up shopping for an hour or so and came home all excited about watching a good movie on Lifetime and fell right to sleep  Didnt wake up until 1100 pm  Oh well I enjoyed myself regardless Talk to you soon Love ya -----Original Message-----From 	Robyn Guy rguywpoitluceduENRON mailtoIMCEANOTES-22Robyn20Guy22203Crguy40wpo2Eit2Eluc2Eedu3E40ENRONENRONcom Sent	Tuesday September 18 2001 844

was going to happen  Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it He wanted to postpone Nell was concerned about losing money girlI was on Steves side and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cakehowever Steve has two blessings in his best men He spoke with them  one from SpokaneWA and the other from Montana  They drove in to Chicago to be with him 30 hours straight through He was so happy on Saturday because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday Everything else went off without a hitch but Karen didnt stop shaking until they cut the cake I think she needed a cigarette Of course Jordan is doing wellhes a Thurston with all there good and bad traitsintellect runs large conduct however is questionable I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff Im attaching a special message that Ill send to Todd separately One suggestion if you dont mind  come to an agreement on how to disciple the children Kids will play you even at Jordans age  This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd Love Robyn  PatriceLMimsenroncom 091801 0822AM  So good to hear from you Yes I did drive back to Houston  I was there on Monday went to the conference in Lincolnshire went to dinner Monday night got up Tuesday drove to the conference and all hell broke loose at that point  Total total chaos I was so frightened  The group said were driving back to Houston once they announced that all airports were closed  21 Hours to get back but I Thank God we made it back and none of us were in harms way One of my close co-workers father just happened to be in New York at the World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday and has been presumed to be dead  It is just a crying shame  Also the impending wardid you ever think you would see this in your lifetime Incidents of this kind really show you thattomorrows never promised  I will be back in the Chicago area real soon more than likely the first or second week in October  Im really skeptical about flying but what do you do How was the wedding  I know it was beautiful Im taking care of myself and living my life  I do what I can if Todd wants to participate Im glad to have him but if not me and the boys rollwe cant wait around Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school hes received very good conduct grades recently and the teacher says he at the top of his class as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff Talk to you later Love Patrice PS  Please e-mail me your work and

retirement and he said the same thing  he is not ready yet but the reality of it is is that we still need to move now and not wait  I just hope he understands  Im glad Daddy is not in alot of pain  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up  Its so hard to face all of this uncertainty isnt it  The good part if there is any is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering  Hes certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever but if there is pain involved I d rather see him out of pain  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom If there is anything I can do from hear just let me know Talk with you later -----Original Message-----From 	Mims Charnella mimscopsorgENRON

be here so I can clear my schedule  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late  The visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how to use the feeding tube I went over there around 900pm from church After she fed daddy thru the tube he upchuck again  So this tells all of us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job   The main concern that is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the vomiting  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 400 and I go back over there to hear what they have to say  Daddy goes to the new doctors on May 31  The main concern is the vomiting  We just have to hang in there and keep praying  After my doctors visit with Daddy on Thursday I had a hard time dealing with it on Friday  Everytime someone would ask me about it I would start crying  I am doing better today and daddys spirit seemed fine last night  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up to him to talk with Corey  The next thing I need to do is call Daddys boss and ask him about his retirement  Even though he is eligible he is not ready to take that final step  when junior and I were talking we wondered about what would happen to the retirement as far as Mom is concerned if he does not officially retire   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are It is very important that his attitude stays positive  Enough for now Talk with you later -----Original Message-----From PatriceLMimsenroncom mailtoPatriceLMimsenroncom Sent Wednesday April 25 2001 1032 AM To mimscopsorg Subject RE Im still

talk to Teena yesterday afternoon she sounded happy I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing  Instead of concentrating on that job I told him to concentrate on his health  He said I was right and said he was going to seriously consider it  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork  That was hilarious  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding little bitty daddy sitting there asleep  I cracked up The concert was good you know those young men showed out  However the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result did not get out of the concert

treated her mom  She really expressed herself  I was proud of her for speaking up  She was very respectful but got her point across  I felt like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what He wasnt getting off that easy  When we got in bed he wanted to snuggle up under me  I then asked him where he had gone the other night  He immediately got an attitude  I asked again and he yelled Why  He then jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if hes 6 yrs old  I said Whatever youve just confirmed what I feel so just go on  get out of here  Hes so-oo

literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel  It was nice but long  The tickets said it started at 600 and I got their at 600  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 600 and seating at 645  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated  But girl Ms Thang felt so good last night  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire  After I left church I went to one of my favorite stores Chicos and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length not by design Im just not tall enough black skirt  The top that I bought set it off so nicely  It was black light brown and gold  I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings not the ones I wear all the time but a new pair much mo flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot  Boy I felt good about my appearance  When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed Jordan said Mommyyou look pretty  Made my evening  Of course Bozo the husband didnt say one word  But I felt good I even had Jordan take some pictures of me so well see how those come out smile We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home Todd said the septic tank is stopped up I have no idea what that really entails but it must of been ugly  He was pissed Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night speaking of rehearsal I was wondering where Samantha had been and Poiter told me yesterday that shes back in school so thats why shes hasnt been there How did your evening go last night  We still need to talk maybe well get a chance to visit tonight  Todd already said he wasnt going to be home until around 1100 pm on Mon Tues or Wed of this week due to Power Mart  I said fine have fun  I am so bitter Im ready for a change too Right now it doesnt seem like me and the boys would be missing much  All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different independent activities  Plus Im ready for a new house clean break and new environment Oh well talk with you later

back  I had a great Easter with the exception of  the  bad news I received late Sunday night  My cousin Renee passed on  Sunday  around noon  She lived here in Houston  Her husband gave her and her  baby  AIDS  Her husband died some years ago  Her mom now has her little  boy  who is close to Siera in age  My 2nd cousin Kenny who lives here  in  Houston also lost his wife on Sunday around 230 pm  She was only 22  years old and they have a two year old daughter  This situation is  really  sad because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty  The  Saturday before last Kenny and his wife were on their way to  Blockbuster  They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player  He stated that she  was  selfish when it came down to him spending  etc  He told me that  the  next thing he knew she jumped out of the moving car  He was going  about  35 mph  She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries  She  lived  a week and one day  Her family is now blaming my cousin and they  called  the police on him at the hospital  The police had to escort my cousin  and  his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him  Kennys wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital  and  the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said  no  Its a good thing they have this on record  I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers  I cant  believe  hes lost that much weight  He is blessed and were praying for God  to  heal him  Were praying for eternal remission right now in the name  of  Jesus  I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren  You  all  alone give him the strength to keep fighting  Church service was good on Sunday  Greg sho nuff preached  However  the  choir didnt sound too good  Doren was out sick so Gerald had to  play and  direct  It was aweful  We were all rocking different ways  No we  did  not sing any of my songs  I only made the 1100 service  Are you  going to  rehearsal tonight  Well I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to  match  I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the  pink  solid shirt  Honey I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on  Saturday  I missed the wedding but made the reception  When I walked in the  room  all eyes were on me  For once I didnt feel self conscious about my  arms  My husband was all over me and giving me compliments  Several of his  cousins told me how good I looked also  Steve wasnt too pleased  about  that  Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought  Write Back  PatriceLMimsenroncom on 04172001 124136 PM  To   NytashaSimsdynegycom  cc  Subject  Whats Happening  Hello  How was your weekend  My weekend was great visiting with my family  Everyone is doing fine   Daddy is doing okay  The radiation  treatments  put the prostate cancer in remission although the Dr said the cancer  would just move to another part of his body  He thinks it may have  moved  to his leg  He had a MRI done last week and today he will get the  results and hes so afraid hes going to need surgery again  Hes  has to  use a walker to get around and hes lost so much weight he probably  went  from 170 to l00  Its really sad he is so small and frail  Hes  starting  to get his appetite back somewhat  He sure had a good time eating  this  weekend  My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner  Please keep  him in  your prayers  Its so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing  help in  everything he does but hes definitely a BLESSED MAN  How was church services on Sunday  Did you make it to all the  services I  dont even know why Im asking I know you didnt go to all of them  thats  a bit much  Did Greg show out on Easter  Anything new going on with  the  choir did you sing any of your songs  This month is going to be  extremely  busy with the revivial and the other church outing  You know I never did get a  chance to ask you what all you ended up  purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day  Anyway talk with you later

Alice had invited me to go to a gala that her book club put on last night at the Omni Hotel  It was nice but long  They featured the poetry and readings of Thomas Melancon  Have you hear of him he was there very good although I am not a poetry kinda sistah but it doesnt cost much to be considerate and supportive of other folks passion  Anyway it was sooooo much fun getting all dressed up the attire was semi-formal  When I got dressed and came out of the bedroom Jordan goes Oooohhhhh Mommy Todd says nothingneedless to say Jordan made my evening  He is really going to be the kind of guy that looks out for his Mom As far as Todd goes Im trying so hard I remember you saying be still and I have been but boy it gets hard sometimes  Alot of times I feel so confident about breaking out of my own after all it could not be much different  Sometimes my mind says do it now since the stock markets are down and I am broke at this time laugh  Anyway Im semi-cool Whats up with you  Any more phone

since Reggie is representing himself after three hours we ran out of time  So we will resume the trial on 1025 and we will argue over the value of the house the stuff in the house and decide how much I have to pay him  You know I have every little receipt I could find so that it reduces this amount  But the final decision on division of the home is up to the judge  The child support amount will be determined too It really doesnt matter the judge wants the kids to be in the house and the most important thing is that I will make all parenting decisions with regard to the children Since then its been crazy at work then I was on the program committee for the annual conference of a professional organization that I belong to  The meeting was here in Chicago so I spent the weekend and Mon and Tues socializing with that group My church girlfriend stook me out for drinks last Friday and Ive been partying ever since  Patrice I didnt know how much of a burden that man was to me until that judge said your divorced effective immediately I havent been this happy since I was in college And guess whatdont tell anyone I havent even told my sister or mother thismy yoga instructor asked me for my phone number on Saturday and actually called me Sunday  Hes 41 divorced  has an undergraduate degree in biology and has the tightest ass youve ever seen  But hes short and has a gold toothand he probably really likes white girls thats enough for now  I got to get some work done  Talk with you soon  Robyn  PatriceLMimsenroncom 101101 1220PM  Hey girl How are you  I hope everything is well with

happen Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it He wanted to postpone Nell was concerned about losing money girlI was on Steves side and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cakehowever Steve has two blessings in his best men He spoke with them  one from SpokaneWA and the other from Montana  They drove in to Chicago to be with him 30 hours straight through He was so happy on Saturday because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday Everything else went off without a hitch but Karen didnt stop shaking until they cut the cake I think she needed a cigarette Of course Jordan is doing wellhes a Thurston with all there good and bad traitsintellect runs large conduct however is questionable I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff Im attaching a special message that Ill send to Todd separately One suggestion if you dont mind  come to an agreement on how to disciple the children Kids will play you even at Jordans age  This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd Love Robyn  PatriceLMimsenroncom 091801 0822AM  So good to hear from you Yes I did drive back to Houston  I was there on Monday went to the conference in Lincolnshire went to dinner Monday night got up Tuesday drove to the conference and all hell broke loose at that point  Total total chaos I was so frightened  The group said were driving back to Houston once they announced that all airports were closed  21 Hours to get back but I Thank God we made it back and none of us were in harms way One of my close co-workers father just happened to be in New York at the World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday and has been presumed to be dead  It is just a crying shame  Also the impending wardid you ever think you would see this in your lifetime Incidents of this kind really show you thattomorrows never promised I will be back in the Chicago area real soon more than likely the first or second week in October  Im really skeptical about flying but what do you do How was the wedding  I know it was beautiful Im taking care of myself and living my life  I do what I can if Todd wants to participate Im glad to have him but if not me and the boys rollwe cant wait around Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school hes received very good conduct grades recently and the teacher says he at the top of his class as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff Talk to you later Love Patrice PS  Please e-mail me your work and home number as well as

Omaha Im sad to hear that Daddys tube does not seem to be doing the job  I had to hear that because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better  Im so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well  I spoke with Mom yesterday daddy was sleep so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape I asked Daddy about the retirement and he said the same thing  he is not ready yet but the reality of it is is that we still need to move now and not wait  I just hope he understands  Im glad Daddy is not in alot of pain  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up  Its so hard to face all of this uncertainty isnt it  The good part if there is any is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering  Hes certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever but if there is pain involved I d rather see him out of pain  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom If there is anything I can do from hear just let me know Talk with you later

Subject  RE Im still waiting Hey girl whats going on  When are you going to be here so I can clear my schedule  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late The visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how to use the feeding tube I went over there around 900pm from church After she fed daddy thru the tube he upchuck again  So this tells all of us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job   The main concern that is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the vomiting  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 400 and I go back over there to hear what they have to say  Daddy goes to the new doctors on May 31  The main concern is the vomiting  We just have to hang in there and keep praying  After my doctors visit with Daddy on Thursday I had a hard time dealing with it on Friday  Everytime someone would ask me about it I would start crying  I am doing better today and daddys spirit seemed fine last night  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up to him to talk with Corey  The next thing I need to do is call Daddys boss and ask him about his retirement  Even though he is eligible he is not ready to take that final step  when junior and I were talking we wondered about what would happen to the retirement as far as Mom is concerned if he does not officially retire   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are It is very important that his attitude stays positive  Enough for now Talk with you later -----Original Message-----From PatriceLMimsenroncom mailtoPatriceLMimsenroncom Sent

youre trying to say  Is he cute  I cant wait to see him  Yes I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon she sounded happy I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing  Instead of concentrating on that job I told him to concentrate on his health  He said I was right and said he was going to seriously consider it  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork  That was hilarious  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding little bitty daddy sitting there asleep  I cracked up The concert was good you know those young men showed out  However the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result did not get out of the concert until 115 pm   I was a tired sister but it was well worth it  The Hilton Southwest is close to me its right be Sharpstown Mall

GuaranteeDocument link Rob Smith Rob I have made a few changes and one correction  I deleted the reference to must pay within 5 business days added to paragraph 3  If Enron does make a demand under this guaranty there is no way we can make payment within those 5 days especially since we will need to rely on an outside party to provide data to us  As you know however when we receive a demand under a guaranty we move quickly to verify the request and make payments where appropriate I completed the information in paragraph 4a I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate authority Finally I reinserted excluding choice of law provisions     language to try to keep the case under Texas law assuming a dispute ever arises All told most of the changes look fine Thanks

 He told me how much he loved me etc  Yeah Yeah Yeah  It all sounded so familiar  He also apologized for the big blow up on Saturday  He even apologized to Siera for the things she heard  She told him that she didnt like the way he treated her mom  She really expressed herself  I was proud of her for speaking up  She was very respectful but got her point across  I felt like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what He wasnt getting off that easy  When we got in bed he wanted to snuggle up under me  I then asked him where he had gone the other night  He immediately got an attitude  I asked again and he yelled Why  He then jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if hes 6 yrs old  I said Whatever youve just confirmed what I feel so just

they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel  It was nice but long  The tickets said it started at 600 and I got their at 600  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 600 and seating at 645  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated  But girl Ms Thang felt so good last night  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire  After I left church I went to one of my favorite stores Chicos and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length not by design Im just not tall enough black skirt  The top that I bought set it off so nicely  It was black light brown and gold  I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings not the ones I wear all the time but a new pair much mo flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot  Boy I felt good about my appearance When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed Jordan said Mommyyou look pretty  Made my evening  Of course Bozo the husband didnt say one word  But I felt good I even had Jordan take some pictures of me so well see how those come out smile We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home Todd said the septic tank is stopped up I have no idea what that really entails but it must of been ugly  He was pissed Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night speaking of rehearsal I was wondering where Samantha had been and Poiter told me yesterday that shes back in school so thats why shes hasnt been there How did your evening go last night  We still need to talk maybe well get a chance to visit tonight  Todd already said he wasnt going to be home until around 1100 pm on Mon Tues or Wed of this week due to Power Mart  I said fine have fun  I am so bitter Im ready for a change too Right now it doesnt seem like me

noon  She lived here in Houston  Her husband gave her and her baby AIDS  Her husband died some years ago  Her mom now has her little boy who is close to Siera in age  My 2nd cousin Kenny who lives here in Houston also lost his wife on Sunday around 230 pm  She was only 22 years old and they have a two year old daughter  This situation is really sad because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty  The Saturday before last Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player  He stated that she was selfish when it came down to him spending  etc  He told me that the next thing he knew she jumped out of the moving car  He was going about 35 mph  She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries  She lived a week and one day  Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called the police on him at the hospital  The police had to escort my cousin and his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him Kennys wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital and the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no Its a good thing they have this on record I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers  I cant believe hes lost that much weight  He is blessed and were praying for God to heal him  Were praying for eternal remission right now in the name of Jesus  I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren  You all alone give him the strength to keep fighting Church service was good on Sunday  Greg sho nuff preached  However the choir didnt sound too good  Doren was out sick so Gerald had to play and direct  It was aweful  We were all rocking different ways  No we did not sing any of my songs  I only made the 1100 service  Are you going to rehearsal tonight Well I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the pink solid shirt  Honey I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday I missed the wedding but made the reception  When I walked in the room all eyes were on me  For once I didnt feel self conscious about my arms My husband was all over me and giving me compliments  Several of his cousins told me how good I looked also  Steve wasnt too pleased about that Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought Write

Daddy is doing okay  The radiation treatments put the prostate cancer in remission although the Dr said the cancer would just move to another part of his body  He thinks it may have moved to his leg  He had a MRI done last week and today he will get the results and hes so afraid hes going to need surgery again  Hes has to use a walker to get around and hes lost so much weight he probably went from 170 to l00  Its really sad he is so small and frail  Hes starting to get his appetite back somewhat  He sure had a good time eating this weekend  My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner  Please keep him in your prayers  Its so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in everything he does but hes definitely a BLESSED MAN How was church services on Sunday  Did you make it to all the services I dont even know why Im asking I know you didnt go to all of them thats a bit much  Did Greg show out on Easter  Anything new going on with the choir did you sing any of your songs  This month is going to be extremely busy with the revivial and the other church outing You know I never did get a  chance to ask you what all you ended up purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day Anyway talk with you later

Hey girl  When I opened up this e-mail I said Wow  It has to be EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this  Girl you are so-oo crazy Sounds like you were a true FOX last night  Thank goodness you werent in Chicago looking like that  The outfit sounds cute  Doesnt it make you feel good when the kids admire you  I can relate to that warm fuzzy feeling brought on by your child  I cant wait to see the pictures Im sorry to hear that youre having plumbing problems  Did Todd call a plumber last night  I wonder how expensive that job will be Im looking forward to rehearsal also  Where was V Michael on Sunday  I was wondering where Samantha had been myself  I heard that she sang with the women 5th Sunday  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher Dimensions with Sis Kaye  We need to visit that church and see what all the hupla is  Do you have a hat for next Sunday After church I went home  cooked spaghetti  Steves cousin was giving a small family b-day gathering for his mom  I didnt want to go but Steve asked me to  On the way home he wanted to talk  He told me how much he loved me etc  Yeah Yeah Yeah  It all sounded so familiar  He also apologized for the big blow up on Saturday  He even apologized to Siera for the things she heard  She told him that she didnt like the way he treated her mom  She really expressed herself  I was proud of her for speaking up  She was very respectful but got her point across  I felt like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what He wasnt getting off that easy  When we got in bed he wanted to snuggle up under me  I then asked him where he had gone the other night  He immediately got an attitude  I asked again and he yelled Why  He then jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if hes 6 yrs old  I said Whatever youve just confirmed what I feel so just go on  get out of here  Hes so-oo stupid  Im his wife and cant ask where hes been  I should know where he is at all times  I just really dont have time for his mess So in what area would you like to purchase a new house  Write back Nytasha PatriceLMims enroncom            To

day off and would not have missed anything  Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law  Shes a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel  It was nice but long  The tickets said it started at 600 and I got their at 600  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 600 and seating at 645  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated  But girl Ms Thang felt so good last night  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire  After I left church I went to one of my favorite stores Chicos and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length not by design Im just not tall enough black skirt  The top that I bought set it off so nicely  It was black light brown and gold  I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings not the ones I wear all the time but a new pair much mo flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot  Boy I felt good about my appearance  When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed Jordan said Mommyyou look pretty  Made my evening  Of course Bozo the husband didnt say one word  But I felt good I even had Jordan take some pictures of me so well see how those come out smile We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home Todd said the septic tank is stopped up I have no idea what that really entails but it must of been ugly  He was pissed Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night speaking of rehearsal I was wondering where Samantha had been and Poiter told me yesterday that shes back in school so thats why shes hasnt been there How did your evening go last night  We still need to talk maybe well get a chance to visit tonight  Todd already said he wasnt going to be home until around 1100 pm on Mon Tues or Wed of this week due to Power Mart  I said fine have fun  I am so bitter Im ready for a change too Right now it doesnt seem like me and the boys would be missing much  All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different independent activities  Plus Im ready for a new house clean break and new environment Oh well talk with you later Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all
