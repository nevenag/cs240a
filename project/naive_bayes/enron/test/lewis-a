Sturm Fletcher J Suarez John Subject WSJ article on UBS acquisition WSJ114 UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 01142002 Dow Jones News Services Copyright  2002 Dow Jones  Company Inc By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal UBS AG the giant Swiss financial firm emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corps North American energy-trading operation Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business once the generator of 90 of the Houston companys profit But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc Enron wouldnt see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year indicating how difficult it will be for the energy companys creditors to recover what they are owed Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec 2 the largest such filing ever shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize Under the terms of the deal which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg the investment banking arm of UBS its wholesale energy-trading operation including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform UBS wouldnt be acquiring any of Enrons huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound It also wouldnt provide any cash upfront to Enron Instead UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprises pretax profit for a 10-year period according to Enron UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three four and five UBS would pay Enron 575 times Enrons prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated As such it could completely eliminate Enrons royalty payments by the end of the fifth year As incentive to buy out Enron UBSs royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10 from years five through 10 up to a maximum of 44 share of pretax profit Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a grand-slam great deal for creditors since new life is being breathed into a perishable commodity Enrons staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enrons Chapter 11 filing last month Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51 stake in a new trading joint venture leaving the energy company with a 49 stake But Mr McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies One possible reason was that resuscitating Enrons vast trading business would require a top credit rating lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book Since the Enron debacle other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity which Enron pioneered and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility Mr McMahon said he feels that by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings UBS apparently hasnt committed to provide any set level of capital There is no determination yet for how royalty payments would be divided among Enrons thousands of creditors The largest question though is whether the trading business can truly be revived Although Enrons global wholesale division which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations generated about 3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001 it has been dormant now for more than a month Martin Bienenstock Enrons lead bankruptcy lawyer characterized the deal as the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enrons trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume and that such trading practice likely will disappear Youll see the churn going away says Michael McNally chief financial officer of TXU Corp now

submitted a 25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J Gonzalez of the US Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections Separately Friday
