to find a number for Sherrie Rutherford but am still trying  Right now it looks like Deb and Bill Steve and Melissa Janie and husband Neil no guest Christie and Ed I think the original list of guests is her list of closest friends that she would enjoy sharing the night with  This may sound odd but I think she would really enjoy having the Maggie and Nora Steve and Melissas girls there--they are very very close and spend much weeekend time togetherand they are a little older 13 and 14 i think--I just mentioned it to Steve and he a said that would be great--Ill call Melissa Other than her family and though maybe a nice thought may be too much of a surprise for her and pretty extreme for us to pull together at the last minute I think with the addition of the girls it will be a wonderful group of 11and likely those who cannot attend will send a note or call so evryone shed want there will be there in one way or another I think a photographer would be great for maybe an hour or so What

Deirdre Penman Gregg Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 1114 Here are my notes from todays call  As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets  Core Non-core and Under Review Core  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Non-core  Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS  Enron has approx 8Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review  EGM EIM  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability  Required resource levels are being carefully studied  Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates Approximately 800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter  These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of 500MM-1Bn  Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Short-term liquidity is provided by the 3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the 1Bn of new debt and the 15Bn equity infusion from Dynegy  Longer-term the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets  It was initially capitalized with 950MM of 144a debt and 125MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 31703 the Enron topup obligation  The 31703 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water  As long as Wessex is worth at least 26Bn there will be no Enron topup required  If we take a 25 haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide 650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt  This 650MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energy-related assets and other assets  It was initially capitalized with 24Bn of 144a debt and 220MM in equity ENE and institutionals  As with Marlin the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b 1Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup  Assuming the same 25 hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx 600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash income and equity  The debt must be retired by 91702 with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions  The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our 10Q will be filed five days late  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing  The committee meets 2-3 timesweek sometimes more often  The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually 7 days a week  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for  That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15 of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval  However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year  Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing 19Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is 21Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the 35Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear  The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas  The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels  It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us McMahon  There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers  But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses  Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business  We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon  The company is overlevered thats a fact--hence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx 1Bn in cash as of 930 which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at 3-3055 if youd like more color Patrick Tucker

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures  No hand-outs were provided Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcfd Ehrenberg 1250 mmcfd Needles 800 mmcfd Wheeler 800 mmcfd New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcfd Hector Rd 50 mmcfd Both will be available around Feb 1 Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system  Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well  Lots of complaints   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system  Eliminating point specific calculation  Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures  No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002   No direct dial-up Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party  However can still make  changes  Can still upload new files 2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline 213-244-3900 and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers  Gas Select is official notification  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific  OFOs can be declared intraday  Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day  Concerned that if call off will have to put back on  Dont want to go back and forth  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcfday between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned Scheduled vs Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110 of expected usage Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week  Can revise expected usage No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110 of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy  Generators need to revise expected usage  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle 4  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called  Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle 1    Nom 1000   0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized  Will allocate prorata  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point  In other words if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from 12 oclock to 12 oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered For OFO assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week  Declare OFO on prior days scheduled volume For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes  For example Flow Day 104                103 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 104 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 104 In other words will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th  look at evening cycle 2 on 104 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes All customers must

minimum daily is changed  If go to 70  current 5 day cycle must end completely before new  goes into effect Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70 before going back to 50 rule Once 90 rule implemented will return to 70 as soon as operationally feasible Contracted Marketers customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account Core Aggregation-subject to 50 daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ Core-50 of daily throughput for the enitre period Patrick Brown group Not subject to 70 and 90 rules 2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count Burnmeasured daily usage thru electronic measurement Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic

Two-pronged request seeks to add more than 100 million to bills but offers to reduce that with PUC concessions like those that helped utility thrive By TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writer Rates for Southern California Gas Co customers have fallen in recent months but they will rise again under an unusual two-pronged request submitted to state regulators Friday The Gas Co asked that its 5 million customers repay about half of a record 223 million in natural gas cost savings the utility achieved for them in the volatile market of the last year The average increase would amount to 152 per month or about 3 on a typical monthly bill of 46 But the Gas Co said it would reduce its request to about 30 million if the state Public Utilities Commission agrees to continue an incentive program that has brought the utility millions of dollars and to change the rules for how much of the windfall goes to the company and how much to consumers That would drop the monthly increase to about 44 cents on a typical bill Although such rate increases may seem relatively modest they follow a winter season in which bills rose sharply--and that made it admittedly awkward for the Gas Co to seek tens of millions of dollars more from its own ratepayers To claim a huge reward for good performance in a year when ratepayers are paying at record levels did not look good said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network or TURN a consumer watchdog group I think it speaks to the companys sense of reality that they did not try to squeeze every last nickel out of ratepayers    It could have been a big ugly fight While other gas and electric utilities have been battered by the natural gas market the Gas Co has thrived under a state incentive program that rewards utilities whenever they can purchase gas for less than market rates By aggressively buying and selling the Gas Co managed savings in the last year that were almost 10 times the highest previous totals However PUC officials raised questions about whether the Gas Co should be entitled to its roughly 50-50 split with customers which would amount to 106 million for the year ended in March During recent negotiations the company agreed to a compromise with the PUCs consumer protection arm and TURN In for the Long Haul Not the Quick Buck The Gas Co now is willing to accept a smaller share of the savings for the last year--about 14--and for future years Were in this for the long haul and not the quick buck said Jim Harrigan the companys director of gas acquisition We want to see the incentive program continue in the future so it can benefit ratepayers and the company alike During a push for deregulation in the mid-1990s the PUC created a program for the states three major gas utilities--Southern California Gas San Diego Gas  Electric and Pacific Gas  Electric--that was designed to give them added motivation to obtain the fuel at the best price for customers The program replaced contentious PUC reviews that determined whether the utilities bought gas at reasonable prices and sometimes resulted in the companies having to pay back millions of dollars to customers By most accounts the program achieved its goals at the Gas Co During the first six years the savings amounted to 757 million--332 million of which went to the utility and the rest to benefit customers But no one envisioned what would happen in the natural gas market over the last year when prices along the California border skyrocketed The Gas Co used its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity to become a big player in the regional market In a trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters the company conducts about 14000 transactions a year buying selling lending and trading gas Last winter when prices rocketed one deal alone achieved savings of 70 million Harrigan said the company bought gas options in October and November We looked at it as an insurance policy he said Those were bought at between 650 per million British thermal units and 8--and the price ran to 10 Those prices allowed the Gas Co to essentially apply the difference to the PUCs incentive program The PUC rules allow the Gas Co to hedge to protect customers from price volatility but they prohibit speculation in the marketplace Harrigan said it is difficult to draw the distinction but he added We recognize when we are incurring risk and have tight controls over it The option purchases he noted were initiated by company Chairman Edwin A Guiles and done in consultation with PUC officials The options he said protected customers from December through March when the Gas Co achieved the lions share of its 223 million in savings I dont think    anyone anticipated savings this large said Richard Myers program supervisor at the PUCs Energy Division As the savings mounted through the winter and beyond PUC officials reassessed the incentive program and questioned whether ratepayers should receive a larger share of the rewards It was only fair they reasoned since customers pay for the pipeline capacity and other assets that allow the utility to beat the market On Friday the Gas Co filed a request with the PUC for its full share of the savings along with its proposed settlement with the agencys Office of Ratepayer Advocates and TURN The agreement which requires approval from the full commission would divert more of the savings to customers Rather than the current 50-50 split the proposed system would give the utility a maximum 25 of the savings The sharing is not nearly as beneficial to the shareholders said Anne Smith the Gas Cos vice president for customer services and marketing We would have loved to preserve the current split but in the interest of ratepayers we think this is a good deal Although the typical monthly winter bill for Gas Co customers rose to 80 from 50 a year ago the price has been dropping in recent months Junes gas cost of 521 cents per therm is about 26 over that of June 2000 But that is far lower than at San Diego Gas  Electric which saw gas costs rise to 143 from 34 cents a year ago Executives of SDGE which like the Gas Co is a unit of Sempra Energy said they have no figures for their incentive program which runs until July Pacific Gas  Electric had no gas cost incentive savings this past year The Gas Cos large savings and aggressive trading have raised concerns that its activities may have driven market prices higher Although Florio of TURN praised the company for a job well done he said I think one of the reasons they settled is to avoid a big fight over whether its actions affected the market to the detriment of others We could have spent three months and not come to a conclusion he added Brian Cherry PGEs director of regulatory relations said Until we can see the details behind the transactions we are not certain as to what impact if any they had on prices at the California border Said Smith of the Gas Co We do firmly believe our actions did not cause prices to go up for other customers The market she said is almost like a race Some came out better than others

----------------------------------------------------------BCS Formula Works Just Fine December 11 2001 By JOE DRAPE The Bowl Championship Series ranking formula was designed to give something to everybody The human polls are counted along with computer rankings the strength of schedule is factored in and teams are penalized for losses and credited for victories over better teams As it has the past three years the system worked Can anyone honestly say undefeated Miami versus Nebraska 11-1 is not the best matchup for the national title game Now Colorado Coach Gary Barnett and the Buffaloes faithful are trying to say it is not Yes Colorado 10-2 beat the Cornhuskers handily and went on to win the Big 12 championship The Buffaloes also lost two games one to Fresno State a fine team with a future pro quarterback in David Carr But Fresno State did not even win the Western Athletic Conference title Louisiana Tech did The Bulldogs posted an 11-2 record by beating league teams like Tulsa Southern Methodist Nevada and San Jose State - a group that finished with a combined 11-34 record The Buffaloes are beating their chests about holding off Texas 39-37 in the conference championship game but the Longhorns rolled over Colorado by 41-7 earlier in the season One loss in a season when there are not two undefeated teams is understandable rewarding two losses would be absurd Colorado did not earn a trip to the Rose Bowl If the Buffaloes beat Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl and Nebraska upends top-ranked Miami in the title game shame on any voter in the Associated Press news media poll who decides that Colorado 11-2 is more deserving of the No 1 ranking than Nebraska 12-1 Oregon 10-1 on the other hand has a right to feel slighted The Ducks can also be heartened that a Miami-lose Oregon-win scenario might earn them the APs top ranking The Ducks who only lost to a very good 9-2 Stanford team are ranked No 2 in both the AP and USA TodayESPN coaches polls The strength-of-schedule and computer component of the BCS formula did Oregon in The won-lost records of opponents and opponents opponents dont lie For Oregon those numbers add up to the nations 31st-toughest schedule compared to Nebraskas 14th-ranked schedule Even if you dislike or dont understand the computer rankings they account for only 25 percent of the BCS formula Oregon was ranked as high as No 2 by one computer and as low as No 8 by another Both were thrown out as the formula requires and the remaining six computer service rankings were averaged Oregons average-point total was 483 which means the computers rated it as the fourth- or fifth-best team in the nation The math is essentially the short way of telling you what an hour of reviewing Oregons season game recaps spell out the Ducks struggled to beat decent but hardly great opponents Six of their games were decided by 7 points or fewer In four games the margin was 3 or fewer The Ducks had to persevere against Wisconsin 5-7 Southern California 6-5 UCLA 7-4 and Oregon State 5-6 Without the moral authority of the No 2 ranking in the human polls Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti and the Ducks fans would assume the same gracious and silent posture as the coaches and partisans at Illinois and Maryland both also 10-1 They would celebrate their fine season at a high-profile bowl game regret their single loss and admit that a down year in their respective conferences cost them a trip to the big game And how about that moral authority After Tennessee lost to Louisiana State last Saturday the coaching colleagues of Nebraskas Frank Solich changed their votes in favor of Barnett and Colorado to try to keep the Cornhuskers out of the title game Say what you want about computers and formulas but doesnt it bother you that the human component of the BCS formula is the only one that can willfully corrupt the integrity of the standing Beyond Colorado and Oregon the loudest whining is coming from the college playoff proponents many of whom are AP poll voters Fortunately they too account for 25 percent of the BCS standing    So far university presidents have emphatically shot down any playoff structure Wisely in my opinion Would the last three weeks with losses by Nebraska to Colorado Oklahoma to Oklahoma State Texas to Colorado Florida to Tennessee and Tennessee to LSU have been as urgent or dramatic if you knew many of these teams were going to tee it up again in a week or two and commence a round-robin Of all the major sports only college football offers a regular season that matters Expanded playoffs in the pro sports and even the NCAA mens basketball tournament give fans cues when to pay attention In college football you pay attention from August on because the playoff is under way The BCS standing was created to ensure that the best two teams met in a title game which wasnt always guaranteed Tennessee-Florida State Virginia Tech-Florida State Oklahoma-Florida State The past three BCS title games resulted in an undisputed national champion Cut through all the noise and in Nebraska youll find a team that won 11 straight by 10 points or more Yes Nebraskas loss was ugly and it came in the season finale which pollsters for some reason have historically found abhorrent Yet Nebraska has one fewer loss than Colorado and has faced better competition than Oregon You may not like the BCS formula but it is fair Whether you calculate by abacus or algorithms Whether you argue it with barroom gusto or classroom decorum the BCS made the right game

and El Paso  Under it FR shippers would convert to CDs at levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years weighted to the present It assures each westward flowing firm shipper based on the curren t physical mainline capacity including L 2000 931winter and 942 summer of their contractual entitlement  On a daily basis all westward FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60 of their 931 and 942 allocation from the San Juan  FT-2 shippers would continue to be served off the top  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology set forth in SoCal Gas initial comments  It includes North and South system segmentation rights and narrowly defined demand charge credits for unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall  Provision is made to encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract s dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7 shortfall Provision i s also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point and to give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the systemwide scheduling process all intended to encourage a strong supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement but as a basis for a merits decision eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary hearings and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once implemented  Alternatively we have left it to the Commission to decide whether other procedures should be adopted  Because it is a motion it may be responded to within 15 days of filing  SRP strongly urges each shipper and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before taking a position in response to the motion  Any shipper that has question s but does not seek answers but merely sticks to their litigation position will only be delaying resolution This proposal is a viable compromiseeveryone gains and everyone loses something  That is why it works  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive comments  Joel Greene SRPstrawmancvrdoc  SRPSTrawmanfiled11-13doc  Attachment 1 filed 11-13doc  Attachments 2-12 filed11-13ppt  Attachment 13 filed 11-13 xls Energy Advocates LLP 202-371-9889 202-371-9025 fax jlgreeneenergyadvocatescom -

estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

 I will         need you to make double baked potatoes I will have Jean bring the         polish         sausage and corngreenbeans  I may get some sourerkraut and     dumplins         from         Stoysich also  I will tell dad that he can pay for the ham         I will have Joey bring a relish trey  and some lasagne I thought     it         was         pretty good         Do we need anything

estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

patcradockhuskyenergyca mailtopatcradockhuskyenergyca Cc	Charles Shoneman Randall Rich Subject	California News -- State building natural gas reserve FYI State building natural gas reserve Officials refuse to reveal details of the contracts Bernadette Tansey Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday August 16 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL httpwwwsfgatecomcgi-binarticlecgifca20010816MN209239DTL California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state But in a repeat of the states tactics when it lined up 43 billion in electricity contracts officials wont say how much they have spent so far -- or how much they plan to buy in the future The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space state officials said But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases Releasing additional details -- such as the price officials paid -- would jeopardize the states goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gas-fueled power plants that serve California said Ray Hart deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy Hart said they could rush in scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state he said Details of the states gas deals will be made public as much as six months after theyre signed when they no longer give traders any advantage he said That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of Californias power needs for more than a decade If there were a competitive bidding process then yes the price should be secret while its pending said Marcel Hawiger a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network But in a situation like it is now where theyre just negotiating backroom deals we think they should be disclosing everything right away Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the states foray into the natural gas market A DISASTER The governors secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the states long-term power buying effort that he credits with taming the out-of-control electricity market in California His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt The states new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under long-term contracts with the state dont hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts if the power plants dont make low-cost deals for gas the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss Hart said If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state he said Harts agency signed a four-year 2 million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm Interstate Gas Services The firm was authorized in July to make short-term gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California STRATEGY QUESTIONED Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late 2002 Bill Marcus a TURN energy consultant said the states high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases Ron Low a PGE spokesman said state gas cost overestimates would add 300 million to consumers bills statewide through 2002 about 140 million would be paid by PGE customers Hart scoffed at PGEs claims For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous Hart said Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts he said But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future Youre going to see prices go up again Mark Allen Bernstein an analyst with RAND said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations he said The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month water department officials said It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from out-of-state producing basins Hart said Hart said critics of the states electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas Hart said the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring We got totally hammered by the media for those variable contracts Hart said My God were

estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub
