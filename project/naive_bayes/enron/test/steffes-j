still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program for non-retail access states  Using an RTP tariff that more closely track s the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational  signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load respons e needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a  DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage By the way I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity  We shou ld make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week Jim -----Original

Luiz Hueter Barbara A Landwehr Susan M Hoatson Tom Nicolay Christ i L Steffes James D Alvarez Ray Shelk John Rodriquez Andy Subject09RE RTO Week Comments -- ICAP The FERC Staff report on RTO Week states that most panelists agree that so me type of long term capacity obligation is needed as long as demand is no t very price responsive in order to allow generation to recover its fixed  costs and support investment 20 The report also notes that some panelists support 20 09-09a recent staff proposal supporting an LSE holding foward call option s on energy YES and20 09-09a capacity obligation being a transitional obligation until demand b ecome price responsive  As I describe below I believe that placing the res ponsibility on the LSE should be sufficient I dont think you need a trans istional period I have cut and pasted our Executive Summary from the ICAP comments as our r esponse see below but I have a couple of questions for this group 09109We say in our comments that a real time energy market through an R TO will give consumers the means to adjust their demand curve because they will see real time prices  However if a state has a rate freeze in effec t andor if retail access is not permitted in a state how can retail load  respond to the RTOs real time spot market prices The short answer would b e they wont  But we need to remember that some states still are moving f orward with some type of retail access mostly for the CI customer market These are the folks who can make a difference and the ones with the most  potential to benefit  In the areas of no retail access it is still importa nt to have a transparent market to send the correct signals for development of transmission and generation but even without retail access and a fixed rate depending upon new technologies and innovations some larger CI cust omers may opt to build their own in-house source of energy and sell off any excess without market signals this would not be possible  We need to inc lude this response in our comments 09209What do we think of a proposal where LSEs hold forward call options on energy as a way to achieve a capacity requirement  This is the proposa l I believe we should support because it places the procurement for suffici ent resources where it belongs on the LSE  The generators will still be a ble to receive a capacity payment the one they like so much now from the ISOs in PJM and NY Your thoughts are greatly appreciated  Also any thoughts you have on othe r parts of the Staff report would be greatly appreciated thanks Dave Perin o for sending you comments Thanks Everyone Sarah EPMI opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requi rements  Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations RT Os that encompass robust competitive spot markets for energy and operati ng reserve products including demand side management products will provid e an efficient and timely solution for the construction of adequate generat ion the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand sid e management products to ensure that demand is met in real time  Spot mark ets reveal the cost of procuring  or not using electricity based on actua l supply and demand conditions and thus signal the need for new generatio n capacity  They also ensure that consumers see the cost of procurement  decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based on discovered prices  These markets will keep supply and demand in balanc e in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning cri teria  Therefore there is no need to continue separate installed capacity requirements in an RTO environment The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is  new to the electricity industry  Regulated consumers have historically pai d utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions  These regulated tarif fs provide little if any meaningful supplydemand price information to th e consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the u nderlying cost of doing so has been high  As a result demand curves hav e been categorized as inelastic or vertical suggesting the need for ca pacity related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand   The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will for  the first time give consumers the means and incentive to change the shape  of their demand curve as a result of direct real time pricing information  Changes in the shape of the demand curve will in turn eliminate the need f or specific capacity related payments as supplydemand interaction and cur tailment will be based on economic choices

Palansky IJay Plotnick Michael Cc Sarah Novosel E-mail Killory Ted Frankel Jonathan Cohen Louis Subject Order 888 Argument Please think about the following 20 In a 20-minute Supreme Court argument the limit will be strictly observed  one needs to be ready to answer questions of all sorts but one cannot co unt on being able to make more than 2-3 points and each of them needs to b e clear from the first sentence points that require development dont work   In light of that 20 1    Should I plan to spend any minutes on the New York side of the case  ie arguing that all transmissions over the grids are in interstate co mmerce and FERC has jurisdiction whether the ensuing sale is wholesale or r etail  On the one hand the NY issue is more important to Enron than th e Enron issue on the other hand my sense is that we are way ahead on th e NY issue after the briefs and the SG will likely do a good job on it in  argument  My sense is that I should be prepared if necessary to utter so mething like the starred portion of the first sentence of this paragraph a nd to defend it against any questions but should not otherwise plan to get into these issues20 We should probably also have a canned sentence ready to address NYs wacky  preemption argument which the one that it relied on most heavily in its op ening brief 20 2    I think my most important tasks are to make clear that i this case  is about FERCs power to require nondiscriminatory access to the interstate grids and not about rates or state regulation of retail sales and ii i t is important to the nation that FERC have such power  I need to make the se points quickly and vividly in a way that the Justices will carry away  That is going to be hard because theoretical abstractions are not vivid  examples take too long to develop and provoke quarrels about details and m etaphors are generally too inexact  Please consider whether I am right abo ut the two points being most important and think about how to make them I think these points are the most important along with making the Court c omfortable with the idea that if they adopted our position they would not b e turning upside down a federalstate regulatory division thats been in pl ace for 60 years 20 20 3    Although in a formal sense our case turns on the Chevron issue plain language no ambiguity hence no room for discretion my instinct but I  am not at all sure about this is that I should not plan to devote time to  these matters  First they are covered well in the briefs  Second whethe r one sees ambiguity does not really depend on staring at the language bu t on understanding what transmission in interstate commerce necessarily c overs in the present age  In other words the way to win the Chevron point is to win the points in the previous paragraph  Hence I ought to prepare  to get the word unambiguous in there somewhere in the middle of a sentenc e and defend it if necessary but not do more  Does this seem right20 I think its worth giving a little more attention since this is the key iss ue below and ultimately the issue on which the Court must rest its decisi on  We dont want to lose the trees for the forest  That said since wev e dealt with it at length in the briefs I dont know that we need much mor e than a reminder of the issue and the arguments  FERC asserts that sectio n 201b does not unambiguously determine whether transmission bundled with retail sale is a transmission or a sale of electric energy at wholesale It concluded that such transmission is a sale  The DC Circuit erroneou sly held that FERCs interpretation was permissible  But transmission does nt stop being transmission merely because it is sold together with generat ion  it is both transmission and a necessary component query whether com ponent is the best word to use of a retail sale  Therefore under the cl ear language of section 201b jurisdiction over all transmissions includ ing transmissions bundled with retail sales is vested in FERC 20 On the related point of NYs position that the wholesaleretail bright line applies to transmission  in particular light of NYs interpretive gymnast ics in its reply re 201a at p6 isnt a good one-liner simply that i f Congress intended to limit FERCs transmission jurisdiction to transmissi ons for wholesale then s 201b would read The provisions of this subcha pter shall apply to the sale of electric energy at wholesale and all associ ated transmissions or something to that effect 20 Note  this issue opens the door to discussion of among other things whet her the exclusive purpose of section 201b was to fill the Attleboro gap  and questions about the structure of the FPA eg the relationship betwee n 201b and 211212 206d etc 20 4   What do I do in argument with LPL  I find the NGA parallel very comp elling and IF the Court decides to go with us it will have no problem citi ng and following that case  On the other hand the argument does not seem  to have persuaded anybody but our team not CADC for example  On balance I am inclined to say The Court has already decided this issue under the p arallel provision of the NGA and use some time to press that point  One r eason for doing so is that in general it will be much EASIER for the Court  just to affirm FERC and CADC than to push thru the complexities and agree w ith us but LPL gives them both a precedent for overruling FERC on its own jurisdiction and a comparatively easy way thru the case20 Agreed  20 20 5  I need to understand why FERCs powers and plans to create regional tra nsmission organizations do not fully solve the problem  I need to get a de tailed understanding of the facts and a one-sentence answer to why there i s still a problem    20 The primary answer in our reply is that Order 2000 does not require RTOs i t only encourages their voluntarily formation and that theres no indicati on that monopolists will give up their market power unless compelled  p  19 20 6  Most important  What other points in addition to 2 and 4 does anyone think I need to be sure to make  Even more important what points made by NY SG EEI California are most likely to trouble the Court and provoke q uestions  Which of them should I plan to answer even if I get no question We might also need to address whether our position runs against 60 years of history  Didnt the states regulate all aspects of bundled retail sales u ntil Order 888  Does our position mean that FERC historically abdicated it s responsibility and the states were regulating without authority  What is the effect of section 201a if not to allow states to continue to regulat e the matters that they regulated in 1935  This may be an issue to broach  only if the Court indicates interest though since I think its the toughe st one for us to answer 20 We might also reconsider our position that unbundling is merely an accounti ng issue  It seems to me that reversing the position we took in our initia l brief will basically hedge our bets  it makes our affirmative argument a little harder since we cant simply say that its crazy to base FERCs ju risdiction on an accounting technique but it also makes NYs argument har der since they cant simply say that but for a change in the accounting fo r electric service the states would still be regulating interstate transmis sions for retail sale  This would also dovetail with some of the other bri efs that made a strong argument that unbundling is a major change in electr ic service necessary to support competition among generators and something over which the states have never exercised jurisdiction 20 Thanks to all for thinking about this

-------------------------------------------------------------------November 8 2001 Vol 3 No 21 When is  Bigger Better The Acquisition of Orion by Reliant The  possible acquisition of Orion Power the owner of many plants that ser ve the  Pittsburgh area by Reliant Resources is the fifth major transactio n affecting  Pennsylvanias generation and electric service since 1996 Rel iant Resources  attempt to buy Orion Power however raises issues not see n before in other  transactions20 Those transactions - the PECO Energy and Unicom merger  the GPU and First  Energy merger the sale of GPUs power plants and Duquesne  Light Company s swap of plants with First Energy and subsequent purchase by  Orion - did  not increase the market power of a particular generation owner 20 Why not All the other transactions involved companies operating in  differ ent markets or companies that did not own generation or sale of power  pl ants from one company to one or more companies In fact taken together the se  transactions reduced consumer costs protected rate caps and decreased stranded  costs They also led to important environmental improvements lik e new pollution  control investments and support for renewable energy Reliant Resources  however already owns generation within PJM and the pur chase of Orion would add  generation to its PJM share once Duquesne joins  PJM West For this reason the  transaction should be carefully reviewed an d used to formulate a new policy  concerning consolidation of generation as sets within a single  market Specifically regulatory bodies should make increased demand  response a co ndition for any transaction that increases generation consolidation  as dem and response strongly mitigates market power Funds should be devoted to  e nsuring that all consumers with a load of 50 kilowatts and above are equipp ed  with time-of-use meters This measure is necessary as the single bigge st  regulatory mistake to date in electricity restructuring is the failure  to make  demand response a central part of restructuring Without it worka bly  competitive markets will not develop or be sustained Apart from  increasing demand response regulators and the Office of Consum er Advocate  should get answers to the following questions - Will Reliant Resources  permit Duquesne Light Company the local distribu tion utility to offer in its  service territory a competitive default serv ice CDS program modeled after the  successful CDS program operating in th e PECO Energy service territory20 -  Will Reliant Resources exercise market power within local markets and sh ould  particular plants be excluded from this acquisition to eliminate mark et power 20 - Will Reliant Resources commit to supporting economic demand-response  pro grams within PJM instead of voting against demand response as it has done  recently - Will Reliant Resources acquisition help finance installation of  time-of-use meters for all customers with demand more than 50 kilowatts within  the Duquesne control area - What will Reliant Resources do to clean up some  of the heavily polluting plants that it owns now or will acquire from Orion 20 Reliant owns portions of Keystone and Conemaugh and Shawville power  plants  It would buy from Orion the Cheswick unit Keystone and Cheswick have no  scrubbers installed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions while Shawville ha s been  scrubbing one out of four boilers In 2000 Keystone Shawville and Cheswick  respectively released 153490 tons 48243 tons and 44908 tons of SOx into  Pennsylvanias air Keystone is also the biggest

PECO Energy  char ged its residential customers in 1996 for coal and nuclear power 20 Market Power Issues In addition to environmental  issues market power issues must be examined Such an inquiry hinges on defining  the relevant market and products20 Nationally total generation capacity  is approximately 800000 MW with mo st of it subject to base rate regulation in  the retail market Despite reg ulation at retail wholesale generation  transactions are generally price d eregulated in all 50 states whether or not  the entities engaged in the tr ansactions are deregulated generation owners  regulated public utilities  municipal utilities or electric cooperatives and  whether or not necessary market institutions required for workably competitive  markets exist20 Orion Power has been participating in the deregulated  wholesale market It owns 81 power plants in New York Pennsylvania Ohio and  West Virginia  producing approximately 6000 MW and has another 5000 MW under  constructi on Orion has done an exceptional job improving the forced outage  rates  especially among its New York City resources The proposed  acquisition of Orion Power by Reliant Resources will form the nations second  largest deregulated power generation owner controlling 1 7279 MW or 615  percent of the deregulated generation market that totals 281000 MW of the  countrys total capacity Reliant Resources has a small er share of the nations  total generation capacity20 Yet these small national shares do not  guarantee that Reliant Resources co uld not have market power in portions of the  PJM Market20 Prior to this proposed acquisition Reliant Resources owned  about 7 percen t of total PJM generation or 4262 MW of generation capacity  within the 5 8000-MW PJM market These facilities include 2009 MW of base load  803 M W of intermediate load and 1450 MW of peaking capacity They are quite  o ld and formerly owned by GPU and Sithe see table in attached document  R eliant Resources is also developing another 1316 MW within PJM20 These  numbers would indicate that regulators should focus on possible mark et power  within the Duquesne Control Area of the units that Reliant Energy is purchasing  from Orion The Duquesne Control area is scheduled to becom e part of PJM West in  2002 but regulators and the Office of Consumer Advo cate should ensure that no  plant is strategically located within the trans mission system so that it  possesses market power even after incorporation  of the control area within PJM  West If any plants that would give Reliant Resources market power are  identified they should be removed from this a cquisition  20 Addressing Market Power The combination of large  generation owners creates concerns over market po wer that can only be identified  and addressed by sound regulatory action  In all three of the Northeastern ISOs  there have been incidents of market power which have resulted in numerous rule  changes There are several rea sons that the electric industry is sensitive to  market power First is the inability to store energy In many other industries  surpluses can be buil t up in low demand periods and used to fill in gaps during  high demand per iods In the electric industry energy is produced and consumed  virtually  instantaneously Second there are barriers to entry in the electric  indus try including discriminatory interconnection practices and other incumbent advantages Third historically the demand for electricity has been inela stic  and creates the opportunity for inflated prices Inelastic electricit y demand is  not surprising when most customers see average prices and do n ot have metering  or the ability to respond to prices For these reasons concrete steps to  combat market power in the electric i ndustry must be taken For starters the  existing market mitigation measur es such as PJMs 1000 price cap should be  examined to determine if the y are sufficient while not being burdensome as to  limit new generation re sources from entering the market20 Secondly  barriers to entry should be reduced especially for distributed  generation and  environmentally beneficial grid technologies like wind ener gy20 Lastly  and most importantly demand-response programs can and must be deve loped  California has shown that energy efficiency can preserve reliabilit y and break  the market power of generation owners Changing the demand for electricity is  the biggest and best protection against market power20 A Deeply  Troubling Tale Unfortunately Reliant Resources did not support  PJMs Economic Demand Res ponse programs voting against them last year in the  Members Committee It had company with all generation owners voting as a block  with one excep tion against demand response Three cheers for the exception  Edison Miss ion20 In the face of the mass opposition of generation owners  PJM wobbled but d id not cave It changed but submitted demand-response programs  to FERC whi ch were approved for the summer of 200120 The moral of this  tale is that the public interest needs regulators the P JM Board and other  interested parties to further demand-response initiati ves because generation  owners will likely be roadblocks In particular r eal-time metering residential  air conditioning and heating programs and  wholesale markets all need to be  developed20 It is time for strong action on these points Regulators must  begin by req uiring Reliant Resources to finance the installation of time-of-use  meters for all customers with demand of 50 kW or more within the Duquesne  contro l area This is especially important as the transition there may be  comple ted by 200420 20 -------------------------------------------------------------------Our events calendar is

Corby Gardiner Charles Mi essner Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Karen Shea Max Bulk Subject IMPORTANT   Motion of San Diego Gas  Electric Company U 902-E for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or der Shortening Time Yesterday SDGE filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism  The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers  The utility requests a 15-day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 September 8 is a Satur day  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access  20 Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there  is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of  an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination20 As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That  stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct  access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of 2000 approximately 20 of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of 2001 direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1 Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly20 These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment  period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over 20kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least 5 years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the  use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of  over- or under-commitment20 In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch 20 Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a near-t erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan  20 The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role  20 When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fee s should also apply  20 There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings  Please let me and others know if you agree 20 Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass 5959 Topanga Canyon Blvd  Suite 244 Woodland Hills CA 91367

Tribolet Michael Curry Wanda Huddleson Diann Subject09EES Billing Issues Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issues--recoupment  of the PX Credit and the 10 surcharge  I would appreciate it if those of  you with more first-hand information particularly Wanda and Diann correct or clarify anything Ive misstated  Also please forward this to anyone e lse with an interest in this matter A  Recoupment of the PX Credit also known as the Negative CTC 1  Background  The issue here relates to the fact that PGE and SCE  are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers  P rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March the bills  would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to TD charges  SCE and PGE have now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo r TD despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in PX Credits  This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opini on of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be col lected as a bill credit and not in cash  Mike Day our regulatory lawyer expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was i mproper and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with th e CPUC  Note  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which ac crued to prior to December 31 2000 the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrued during that time frame and there is no dispute as to the p roper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame  Further more PGE and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that had accrued as of December 31 2000 2   Action ItemsIssues  a  With respect to SCE Legal is evaluatin g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC  The CPUC has a process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust omers while the issue is being determined by depositing the payments in an interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC while there is no equiva lent procedure in federal court one can request that the court enter an in junction against the utilities disconnecting customers   While the analysi s is worth doing I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the CPUC for relief  b  With respect to PGE the banruptcy team is evaluat ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court 3  Timing  Late fees will begin accruing August 20  The first discon nect notices would not be received until September 19 4  Effect on other CTC issues  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effec t on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17 and pr ospectively B  10 Surcharge 1  Backgound  Although when provisionally imposed in January the 10 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent  when ma de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWRs purchases of  power on behalf of the utilities  This evolution gives rise to two bases f or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the 10 sur charge  First since the 10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene ration for bundled customers only and not direct access customers direct  access should not have to pay it  This is the same logic that caused the C PUC to exempt direct access customers from the 30 surcharge Secondly if legitimately applied to direct access because it is of no dir ect benefit to direct access customers it arguably can only be viewed as  a tax  Under EESs contracts with its customers taxes assessed at the del ivery point are borne by the customer  Note  SCE unlike PGE may not im pose the 10 surcharge on direct access customers according to a filing ma de at the staff level at the CPUC so this action may relate to PGE only 2  Action ItemsIssues  a  Regulatory Jim Steffes has the lead i n advising us about a challenge to the application of the 10 surcharge to  direct access customers at the CPUC  It may be advisable for an industry g roup rather than Enron to make the filing  b  I would expect that we wou ld follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with th e CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected  In the interim we would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success ful c A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 w hen the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was fi rst imposed 3  Timing  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no tices 4  Effect on other CTC issues  Regulatory Jim Steffes will analyze with the appropriate people the effect if any of taking this position on other CTC issues principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17  and prospectively20 End    20

at the DC Circuit and subsequently with FERC would possibly mean some upside for Enron -- even if for one year pre-new RTOs per Kevin 10-15 MM  There is also something positive about being on the same side as a utility against another utility We should approach VEPCO about talking with some FERC people about possibly settlement  it may lead to something positive and can allow us to discuss our RTO

Richard Subject Enron v FERC appeal at DC federal court Entergy source and sink The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this  I asked BP for the costs to get through oral argument which are only 4000  During the course of our SE RTO mediation the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMPfinancial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southerns similar attachment  However that model should we get it wont be in effect until sometime next year at the earliest  Also Enron has sold its control areas VEPCO our co-appellant still has Batesville in Entergy It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter get their thoughts and then perhaps approach Entergy  FERC is the one that would actually settle not Entergy also FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att M is certainly good for precedent but Southern can still keep its Att unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff  If nothing else having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model no day ahead balanced schedules which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att M would be helpful  What are your thoughts -----Original Message-----From Jacqueline Java

time has proved us 100 correct on that and if APS wants to change the settlement then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well That said we do not get a great reception in AZ and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter at least not yet  We would have no one on our side SO it is an opening but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them given the less than great odds -----Original Message-----From 	Nord Sue Sent	Tuesday October 23 2001 353 PM To	Keene Patrick Lawner Leslie Subject	FW APS Filing Is this something in which you think we should be engaged -----Original Message-----From 	Steffes James D Sent	Tuesday October 23 2001 415 PM To	Nord Sue Shapiro Richard Subject	RE APS Filing No  Talk with Pat Keene andor Leslie Lawner  We havent done much on Arizona lately Jim -----Original Message-----From 	Nord Sue Sent	Monday October 22 2001 511 PM To	Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Subject	APS Filing Are we or EPSA taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort  Theres an article on the filing in todays Electric Power Daily that says theyve filed to push back the requirement that they purchase 100 of their power from the competitive market by 2004 to a requirement that they purchase 25 of their power competitively by 2008 Sue Nord Senior Director Government Affairs 713-345-4196

Lisa Subject	California Update--082701 The California PUC Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commissions previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers The Legislature The Assembly version of the Senate MOU SB 78 has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 630 PM PDT today Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon based on negotiations between Davis office and business customers Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000 including those involuntarily returned to bundled service would be exempt from charges for Edisons undercollection DWRs forward contracts and DWR-related exit fees provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edisons remaining customers Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edisons undercollection DWRs forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edisons remaining customers Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17 2001 and August 24 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edisons remaining customers Customers leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution rather than the date by which the customer must be DASRd in order to qualify for the exemptions Direct Access would not be suspended however until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis if he signs it ie the effective date of the bill So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions After the 90-day period DA would be suspended until 1103 Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edisons undercollection and DWR charges Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year on a first-come-first-serve basis At least 30 of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen

Legislative Issues September 1-15 2001 ENERGY ISSUES 1    Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman D-NM released his draft Chairmans Mark of electricity restructuring legislation  The draft is positive for Enron on transmission issues including access jurisdiction and RTOs and reliabiilty  We have concerns about provisions on transparency market-ba sed rates and merger review  We have said we are generally pleased while  we work to amend those provisions about which we have concerns 20 2    We drafted testimony for Jim Steffes to be the EPSA witness at a Hous e Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing on reliability siting and tr ansmission pricing issues the hearing was cancelled due to the tragic even ts of September 11 2001 20 TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY 20 House Speaker Dennis Hastert R-IL said that he didnt expect the House to vote on Trade Promotion Authority until next month citing a need for House Republicans to get all our ducks in a row  Senate Finance Chairman Bauc us D-MT has stated that he would wait until the House took action on TPA  before he would introduce his measure  With the House pushing the vote unt il October it lessens but doesnt eliminate the likelihood that a bill w ill be done this year 20 Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas R-CA who is taking the lead for the  House Republicans has vowed to spend more time working with Democrats to c raft a bipartisan product  Ways and Means Ranking Member Carl Levin D-MI has not yet introduced his bill  He is still meeting with Democrats and h as stated that he wants to introduce the most balanced bill he can that w ill include labor and environmental provisions 20 20 The Administration continues to push hard for TPA  They have made securing trade promotion authority their chief trade objective this year  Presiden t Bush recently said that he wants TPA before the World Trade Organization  ministerial in November 20 BANKRUPTCY REFORM 20 House and Senate Conferees are hoping that conflicts between the House and  Senate versions of the Bankruptcy Reform bill will be worked out expeditiou sly  House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner R-MI who is chair of  the Conference has stated that the Conference will meet formally for the f irst time next week 20 There are two sections of the Bankruptcy Reform bill that have significant  importance to Enron 1 financial contract netting provisions which are in cluded in both the House and Senate versions and 2 a technical correction s amendment regarding production payments which is currently included in t he House version only 20 20 There are 32 members of the House and Senate who have been appointed to the Conference which is unusually large  The Conference has to deal with 38  amendments that the Senate made to the House bill including the technical  corrections amendment regarding production payments  The Administration h as some problems with the bill none that pertain to our issues  The progr ess is expected to be slow 20 FY 2002 TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS - MEXICO TRUCKING BAN 20 Just prior to the adjournment for the August Recess the Senate passed the  FY 02 Transportation bill which contained provisions that called for stric t safety standards for Mexico trucks gaining unrestricted access to US ro ads  Senator Phil Gramm R-TX and Senator John McCain R-AZ both vehemen tly oppose the restrictive language but in the end allowed a final vote on  the appropriations measure  They have vowed however to hold the bill up  in the House-Senate Conference until the Mexico trucking language is resolv ed note the House prohibitive language is more restrictive effectively p rohibiting Mexico trucks from ever going beyond the current 20-mile radius  they now have access to  The White House has on several occasions reite rated their objection to any language in the bill that would halt or slow d own NAFTA provisions allowing cross-border transit which were to have been enacted January 1 2001 - making the provision well-behind schedule alread y 20 While the Mexicos Economic Minister has stated that he would not seek sanc tions against the United States for violations of the NAFTA Mexico Preside nt Vincente Fox has stated that he would consider limiting or even prohibit ing US trucks on Mexicos roads  A recent study indicated that the US s failure to execute the cross-border transit provisions of NAFTA could cos t Mexicos economy upwards of 100 billion per year 20 20 The Senate and House will now go to conference on the measure and its exp ected to be a contentious debate in Conference 20 20 MINIMUM WAGE HIKE 20 The House will likely act on a minimum wage measure following Senate action  which is expected this fall  House Republican leaders are insisting how ever that any increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks fo r small businesses  Additionally it is likely that the minimum wage bill  will be a vehicle for other business tax credits and pro-business measures 20 20 Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle D-SD said that the Democratic minimum  wage bill will come to the floor in the fall  It is expected however tha t Senate Republicans will attempt to add several tax cuts which Democrats  would oppose unless there are offsets meaning the tax measures would have to be paid for elsewhere in the budget 20 20 The White House has said it favors a minimum wage increase providing it con tains flexibility provisions  President Bush would be unlikely to veto a m easure absent state flexibility provisions if it contained certain tax cut  components20 20

the creation of an unregulated monopoly If competition is assumed to develop very rapidly and wholesale market prices are imposed on customers without regulatory intervention and from a market that is not workably com-petitive higher prices and rates that do not meet the statutory standard of just and reasonable are likely On the other hand if a long transition is assumed and significant regulatory control continues to be exercised over prices competition and its benefits could be stifled indefi-nitely In March 2000 the PSC initiated the proceeding to examine the states progress toward competitive markets It sought information on the difficulties that have emerged lessons learned and directions for where to go next The recommended decision says that in a competitive market utilities should play no role in providing electric or gas service But before the PSC removes a utility from the market cer-tain preconditions must be met includ-ing a determination that the wholesale and retail markets are operating without the exercise of market power As a gen-eral matter the utilities should not be removed from any market until multiple suppliers offering a variety of products are available for the entire customer class throughout the utilitys service ter-ritory The PSC also should wait for state lawmakers or the courts to confirm its authority to take such action The recommended decision also says that robust fully competitive retail markets will develop at different times for different customer classes The PSC should encourage invest-ment in transmission and distribution infrastructure for both electricity and gas including if necessary ordering the franchised utilities to construct any need-ed facilities the recommended decision says Although the PSC should restate its support for retail competition and pro-ceed with deliberate speed in fostering market development the agency should maintain just and reasonable rates throughout the period of transition to competition We are confident that a flexible oversight process that encourages com-petition and allows it to develop wherev-er the economics can support it will pro-tect consumers during the transition per-mit markets to develop freely and will serve the public interest the recom-mended decision says Exceptions to the proposed decision are due tomorrow and responses are due Aug 28 The judges and the PSC official plan to present a final recommended decision to the commission this fall JCS

IURC C Janine Below is a short response I have drafted if we choose to respond although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary to these emails  Im a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails  I think our best response to Ron Cinergy is that MISO does not serve load so MISO is not accountable to IURC  Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility  If we agree with that statement are they subject to any IURC oversight  Even if they are I dont think it should be because of the bundled retail load issue but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all public utilities perhaps for safety reasons within its state  But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility then we may need to revise the statement below I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any bundled retail load in Indiana once MISO is operating  In a prior order FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff  If this is the case one could argue that the service is no longer bundled but I dont think we want to get into that argument with these guys Here is some language that I put together  What does everyone else think The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region  MISO will not serve retail load nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers  Therefore we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers  They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers  It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC not MISO -----Original Message-----From 	Steffes James D Sent	Friday November 09 2001 1028 AM To	Migden Janine Roan Michael Stroup Kerry Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Subject	RE FW Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners Proposed Settlement Agreement -

IURC C Ron It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval but it also seems to me that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to an RTO which does have FERC approval  In other words come December 15 or January 1 or January 15 we could have Indiana utilities still being operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are today  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition If my proposition is correct then the issue becomes whether the proposed transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83 ie a public interest standard As you know I think that MISO has done a creditable although by no means perfect job in considering and balancing the interests of affected parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process     So I think that it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and load up the IURC approval process with a lot of party-specific Christmas tree ornaments By the same token I am quite concerned about a rubber stamp approach to IURC review  I think that the state-level parties and the IURC have a significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not exceed five  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects of MISO operation on Indiana retail load  I think that the state-level parties and the IURC have an interest in defining the goals or standards for MISO performance during the initial transfer period based on which an extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied  I think that the state-level parties and the IURC have an interest in the MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of accountability re at least bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission and the Indiana parties   And I do not see those interests being recognized or accommodated very much if at all in your settlement proposal  Do you disagree  If so tell me how you see those interests addressed in your proposal I want to hear what others say but as matters stand my inclination would be to pursue these issues in the hearing brief them and then let the Commission decide  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC decisional process enough to make a difference If so how much delay with what effect Thanks Mike Michael A Mullett Mullett  Associates 309 West Washington Street Suite 233 Indianapolis IN 46204 Phone 317 636-5165 Fax  317 636-5435 E-mail  mullettcacaolcom

the past few weeks has been discussing the prospects of state agencies eg the CEC pursuing a long-term 1-2 year strategy of re-introducing centralized Integrated Resource Planning in California  Indeed some CEC staff have used sought to obtain planningmodelling authorities that could lead to dispatch instructions or perhaps identification of generation units for retirement The CPUC is opening a rulemaking OIR to return to integrated resource planning  The BRPU returns  Anyway we will be discussing this further at the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes available -----Original Message-----From Andy Brown mailtoabbeslawfirmcom Sent Thursday October 25 2001 1036 AM To Steven Kelly doug kerner Jan Smutny-Jones Subject highlights from CPUC meeting Importance High FYI  Highlights from todays CPUC meeting  It is still in progress with few energy items remaining  Regular results memo to follow CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to integrated resource planning with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update BRPU proceeding  Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options including new asset construction power purchase agreements conservation transmission etc CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes lines to NV AZ and MX  Will begin new phase re economic projects CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge ALJ ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts  CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes but that they must move forward on ordinary review process  This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCEs CPUC rejects PGEs call for market valuation of retained generation PGE argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates  CPUC rejects argument  Duque will concur but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets and fact that PGE still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation  It is also unclear notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement --Andrew Brown Sacramento CA

The convention opened with remarks by NARUC President William Nugent FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell PA PUC Chairman Glenn Thomas substituting for former Governor Ridge and the featured speaker Comcast Cable President Brian Roberts a	Nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didnt much of anything b	Brownell introduced a Georgia Commissioner named Bubba who sang several patriotic songs she did not address anything relative to FERC policy or activity c	Thomas spoke about the great state of PA Benjamin Franklin William Penn and Philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy d	Roberts talked about the future of cable television 2	The FERC Policy Update - this panel consisted of moderator Nugent FERC Staff Dan Larcamp Southern Company Chairman Allen Franklin James Torgenson of DPL and PA Commissioner Terence Fitzpatrick a	Larcamp and did not provide very much information or in-site into FERC RTO policy  He did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the RTOs what he didnt say was that they would be the same rules and protocols  He said that they are looking at 3 RTOs at least  In the Midwest the Alliance is moving forward and MISO is getting bigger with the addition of SPP and that FERC is looking at if the Midwest RTO should be 1 or 2 RTOs in the Northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered I took this to mean that on governance they are going to go threethreethree from each ISO but others I talked with outside the session didnt get that - time will tell and the Southeast will be slower to develop there are small but clear regional differences that are important and that it must accommodate the for-profits and the not-for-profits public power b	Franklin from Southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for RTOs interesting comment and there are two major issues to be considered in forming RTOs - cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted  He promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate  He promoted the SETRANS model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south c	Torgenson of DPL gave a very dry overview of the status of MISO with nothing new to report d	Fitzpatrick of PA one of the Commissioners Steffes Montovano and I met with in July began by stating the PA Commission is fully supportive of the NERTO must have been our July meeting for two reasons i advantages of a bigger market and ii FERCs clear preference for PJM as the platform  He mentioned the concern of commissions in other PJM states but in general there is support  He then went on to stress the merits of DSM 3	The last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an Enron perspective we have quickly  become the fodder for case studies and Enron is now a verb that is more akin to a four-letter verb  The panel consisted of moderator Iowa Commissioner Diane Munns Charles Cicchetti of Pacific Economic Group Jeff Miller of JP Morgan Partners Christine Uspenski of Schwab Capital Markets and Walter Rogers of Merrill Lynch Asset Management a	Cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators job harder and that they must be market participants he used the term GONZO market participants  He also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the RTOs no one will build transmission no reason given and that regulators need to be involved b	Rogers of Merrill Lynch most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions -

from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9  SCE said that it h as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesnt know what to charge  for DWR Meanwhile it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through  the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR  Once the CPUC decides on the  DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generation-relat ed CTC again  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond 33102 once QF contracts are above the market   SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4 I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC  they will bill it  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 1027 cents ma king it about 1077 cents that collects the 400 million that was uncollec ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc harge  The half cent addition is for 12 months -----Original Message-----From 09Curry Wanda 20 Sent09Friday August 10 2001 851 AM

summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday August 8th  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything 20 Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enrons exposure to PX credits  Steve S wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal and his goal is t o have recommendations for EWSEES management on August 14th 20 Current Issues 1  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undeterm ined SCE and PGE have implemented different methodologies 2  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers PGE  is passing thru to DA customers SCE is not 3  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX  clearing prices from Oct 2 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised  PX credits20 4  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for TD 5  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs CTC or other pass through charg es making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions 6  Large uncollected receivables from both PGE and SCE The four proposals are as follows SCE Recommended Approach20 09This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January 18 20 01 forward  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the 09g ross PX receivable as billed by each utility  which would  be reversed   This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no 09generationcomm odity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the 1 cent  wi ll be applicable to Direct Access customers 20 09Enron would request the following 091 Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES  or EEMC 092 SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an allowabl e claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possib le 20 093 PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument20 094 Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balan ces on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility pare nt 09level20 095 Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits ifwhen an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC20 09Other consideration 09Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concern re  CTC or other surcharge amounts 20 PGE Recommended Approach 09This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 1 8 2001 would include an avoided cost  component  This avoided cost 20 09component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDWR pur chases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchases   09This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX clearing p rice in the old PX formula through March 2002    If the actual CDWR purch ase 09costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embedded  gen costs  should be included in the calculation 20 09 09Enron would request the following 09Same as above 09Other Consideration 09Enron  would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the  actions of the utility at a minimum through March 2002  This would hamper 09Enrons ability 09to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio20 Hybrid Approach 09This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from January  18 2001 through September 1 2001 and that the SCE approach is 09applicab le from September 1st forward   This approach might be necessary as a comp romise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal20 09Enron would request the following 09Same as SCE and PGE approach 09Other considerations 09Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concern re  CTC or other surcharge amounts 20 Enron Model20 09This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP15 and SP 15 calculation methodology for the PX credit  20 09Enron would request the following 09It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG E and SCE   The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is  09the probability of getting this approach approved is low   However und erstanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value 09Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and C PUC 09Other considerations 09This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk but th is is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the 09actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting Thanks Wanda Curry

have Jeff Dasovich run the traps and b discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint If this doesnt get us anywhere before August 19 then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC  I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies Please call me Jim PS There is a meeting on the 1ckwh surcharge with Janet Dietrich today at 130 in her office  I think you should attend -----Original Message-----From 	Williams Robert C Sent	Tuesday August 07 2001 605 PM To	cafergusonllgmcom jbennettgmssrcom mdaygmssrcom Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Kingerski Harry Mara Susan Cc	Sanders Richard B Sharp Vicki jklauberllgmcom Curry Wanda Huddleson Diann Dietrich Janet Black Don Subject	PX Credit Claim Now that we have the SCE bills showing that they are not going to credit past PX Credits against the TD charges here is the preliminary plan for challenging SCEs and PGEs anticipated action  As Diann explained the bills begin becoming past due August 19 with late fees of 15 accruing thereafter  Disconnect notices could be received 30 days thereafter or about September 19  Our target date for filing is Monday August 20 1  Charley Ferguson LeBoef Lamb will prepare an analysis of the pros and cons of challenging the action in federal court versus at the CPUC considering eg bias of CPUC timing disconnect protection etc  Charley will draft alternative Complaints   He will get the input of the bankruptcy lawyers on the draft PGE complaint  I will circulate these drafts as soon as they are available 2  Charley will first meet with Jeanne Bennett for a download  After that meeting he will likely also wish to speak with Wanda and Diann for additional background information  Thank you for your generosity with your time 3  I will check with Sue Mara to see what if anything the other ESPs may be planning to do to challenge SCEs action  Not many still have direct access customers but some do 4  I will talk to Jim Steffes about an unofficial approach to SCE Please let me know if I have missed anything and I would appreciate it if you would forward this along to anyone else who you think may like to have this information  Thanks

Cc	gpetersepsaorg dsalvosaepsaorg mbennettepsaorg Subject	Draft House Staff Reliabilty Language EPSA had wanted comments by Noon today on the House staff draft on reliability hence I have copied them on this e-mail  There has been e-mail traffic between and among many if not all of us as we have looked at this langauge and as Charles and I have had various conversations with EPSA staff  Below are some comments and some issue spotting to get your reaction as we continue to evaluate this important subject 1	The House staff draft supposedly based on informal Administration language does appear to be an improvement over the NERC language -- the extent to which it is so is open to interpretation and judgment  While it is shorter and does NOT have the regional entities and variances in the NERC language the basis of the House staff draft is still an ERO  I thought we did not want an ERO of any kind particularly one created by statute  On the other hand some argue an ERO of some type is inevitable and task should be to give FERC as much control over it as obtainable  Furthermore the House staff draft appears to make approving an ERO discretionary with FERC the text says FERC may certify an applicant to be the ERO 2	Given that the House staff draft is an improvement -- and it is a welcome development that it is NOT the NERC language -- it would be a major tactical victory to have both the Senate and the House mark up vehicles WITHOUT the NERC consensus text  Since EPSA is the group most likely to NOT want NERC at this point I appreciate the tactical need not to dump on the House staff draft to the point where the House staff says well if you dont like we should go back to the NERC version since there is a group that  DOES support that version  So we have to keep that in mind  In short we need to nurture the House staff draft for House markup purposes while keeping our options open to support the Bingaman language in the Senate and perhaps in conference too 3	EPSA may be able to seek further improvements to the House staff draft  As written it gives FERC more jurisdiction than the NERC version and less procedural hurdles -- but there are still some procedural hurdles although one can argue of far less consequence than the NERC version  Bingaman gives FERC more direct reliability jurisdiction than the House staff draft  Specific issues are identified below 4	Specific Issues Spotted In House Staff Draft --a	There is no definition of reliability and thus it is unclear what matters are within the jurisdiction of the ERO on which to develop standards and enforce them  Perhaps there needs to be a sentence that says FERC can assign specific matters to them or otherwise define the EROs turf  Would FERC have that ability without specific language  Another option is to use the definition of organization standard in the NERC version which makes it clear that the subject matter is technical standards --  not a broader agenda under the guise of reliability b	Unless I am mistaken the House staff draft would allow FERC to certifiy more than one ERO  This would be an odd result by contrast the NERC version makes it clear that if more than one entity applies FERC picks one to be THE ERO but then requires that single ERO to defer to regional reliability entities -- there is no such deference under the House staff draft  On the other hand if FERC can approve multiple EROs -- would this result in regional EROs perhaps one in the East and one in the West c	There is an internal conflict in the House staff draft  Part of it says FERC could assign the enforcement role of an ERO in a given region to an RTO  But from the NERC-led discussions PJM and others have pointed out the criteria for an ERO has independence language and other organizational criteria that an RTO could not meet ie the ERO must be independent of users and owners and operators of the bulk power system under the House staff language d	Why does there need to be language saying proposed reliability rules go into effect after so many days if FERC does not act  Like the NERC version the House staff draft precludes FERC from directly amending standards although there is language that says FERC can order the ERO to propose a standard as there is in the NERC version  Some say this should not be objectionable because as a practical matter this is the manner for FERC to amend proposed standards without offending Canada and Mexico  Others see it as a needless hurdle The House draft has direct FERC amending authority on the rules by which the ERO operates -- but NOT on the reliability standards themselves

Premise Importance High I dont agree Edisons premise -- that direct access customers contributed just as much to SCEs procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers We need to make clear that we dont buy in to their rhetoric Heres my reasoning DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers SCE had to bu y power to serve the bundled load  SCE did not buy power for DA customers SCEs purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high  wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for  the undercollection I can make the argument that the undercollection is SO LELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE There are two big reasons that back me up AB 1890 and Top-down rates  I w ill explain  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments of 30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any co mpetitive retail market until their costs were paid off  One of the tradeo ffs however was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WH OLESALE MARKET  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or  bad hydro years the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill ions by the 33101 deadline Thats the risk they agreed to  Now they ar e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more  This is in dire ct conflict with the statute I can make the argument that the statute requ ires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs al one -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesnt make ESPs subject to any presumed undercollection Now to the rates  At the beginning of DA the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the  retail busness from TD So they did a top-down calculation  This meant that there had to be a credit put on the bills of DA customers to accoun t for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA S o the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingne ss to unbundle specific components of the rates  Next although bundled cu stomers rates were capped the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that t here was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be  whatever was charged by their ESPs  However when the utilities filed thei r tariffs with the CPUC they added a cap for the PX credit that was neithe r proposed nor authorized by the Commission  Enron attacked it but got no where until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding Our a rgument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA cust omers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilit ies avoided by not serving DA customers  We argued that anything less is f undamentally unfair and anticomeptitive  The utilities must have thought w e had a good case because they agreed to settle The settlement was accept ed by the Commission in the proceeding Everyone understood that eliminatin g the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT AB OVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high So we have a legal right to r eceive the full PX CreditNegative CTC which is separate and distinct from  any undercollection associated with bundled customers It seems as if we sh ould be able to prosecute this legal right keeping in mind I

Subject  disruptive technology short and simple and confidential We produce politicalpublic affairs television programs which air in state capitols Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio expanding into NJ Md and DE The disruptive technology is this the real target of the TV show is the guest not the audience Lobbyists have trouble scheduling time with politicians and regulators and when they get on the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from government decision makers We dont have trouble with either Every politician and appointee wants to be on television they always say yes When they ask us what the topics will be and we mention something like telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on television In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them In short Step one identify govt decision makers that our sponsors want to influence Step two invite them on the program and in doing so develop rapport with their key staff members on the relevant issues Step three send briefing materials andor give a briefing in person before the the taping Step four towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely been bragging about hisher policy agenda Step five steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics framing the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to resist the conclusions suggested by the host Step six take the statement of support for the position we favor eg tort reform privatization deregulation tax cuts etc which by the way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air and in addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show we digitize it and send it out to legislators regulators and the proper beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker to back off later Current sponsors Medical Society Hospital Association State System of Higher Education Manufacturers Association Cornell Corrections ATT Levels 25K 50K 100K per year for Pa 15k for Ohio one level only This is an amazingly simple elegant and direct way to influence policy makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms in partnership with us Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit Ill be in touch ps Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer via intermediaries if you are publicity shy Jerry Bowyer Pennsylvania Newsmakersseen across the state on

Mark A PR Comnes Alan Badeer Robert Williams III Bill Mallory Chris Denne Karen Belden Tim Yoder Christian Sanders Richard B Subject	As the CAISO Turns  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs long-term contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought  I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention 1  According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions 2  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy Real-Time auction first  CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section 862 d  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy  If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as 000  Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR 3  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as 000  Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it 4  While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis  Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts  Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO 5  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of 000 expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to 000  These SCs are in for a big surprise  According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as 400MWh for imbalance energy  Where is the price mitigation here 6  Who benefits under this scam  Davis and CDWR  Who loses under this scam  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy 7  Sources  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also 8  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no real-time price transparency We may see an hourly ex-post price of say 15 but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets 9  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative -----Original Message-----From Almeida Keoni mailtoKAlmeidacaisocom Sent Thursday August 23

-----Original Message-----From 	Blair Kit Sent	Thursday August 23 2001 342 PM To	Hall Steve C Legal Cc	DL-Portland Volume Mgmt Subject	487 Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487 487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds 15000mwh 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO  His response was this  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS  In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS -Kit

40 additional charge which they turned ov er to the state and fed  This is potentially A LOT of money to waste on an interconnect if it is an expensive one  Working with Enrons tax dep t I do not remember specifically with whom we convinced PGE that taxes  were probably not due for various reasons and we mutually agreed to get a  private letter ruling from the IRS confirming  We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due that we would pay them  I understand that that IRS  ruling was put in abeyance pending some sort of law congress was consideri ng  I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations  The point  of all of this  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t o address the tax issue  Is it too late  Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro cess  Does anyone know the status of the law making process 20 I am concerned about taxes for two reasons  First many of the opponents t o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid  for by the utility and  included in rate base  In other words all gener ators are good and benefit the ratepayers  On fundamental grounds they w ill resist paying for upgrades  If they believe that they will get the ins ult after injury treatment pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades  they will resist the NOPR more strenously  FYI to everyone Calpine str ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it  And guess what  Now with all of the new plants - 1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problem s around all of the projects just as we forecasted  ISO is now considerin g adding a new zone andor charging PGE andor the projects for congestion   Because PGE did not and probably never will in our lifetime add the g rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase the projects will be hurt  Beca use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project  in a timely manner this outcome exactly as we had forecasted is why we s upported the approach in the proposed NOPR  Second perhaps naively I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades  On a project we are now develo ping in Roseville CA we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up grades in PGEs system  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the gift  are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburgs electric transmissi on system upgrades  Since it sounds like the same issue sure would be nic e if we could get some appropriate precedence going  Any possibliity of de aling with the tax issues in this NOPR -----Original Message-----From Lindberg Susan20 Sent Friday October 26 2001 729 AM To Parquet David Hueter Barbara A Rasmussen Dale Dieball Scott Tweed Sheila Booth Chris Carnahan Kathleen Churbock Scott Comeaux Keith Gimble Mathew Grube Raimund Hausinger Sharon Inman Zachary Jacoby Ben Keenan Jeffrey Kellermeyer Dave Krause Greg Krimsky Steven Kroll Heather Mitro Fred Moore John Tapscott Ron Whitaker Rick Baughman Edward D Coulter Kayne Day Smith L Gilbert Gerald Kinser John May Tom Miller Jeffrey Will Lloyd Cc Comnes Alan Fulton Donna Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Steffes James D Subject FW FERC rulemaking on Generator Interconnection Please see the attached  FERC has asked for preliminary comments on its pr oposal to adopt a standard generator interconnection agreement and procedur es the deadline for comments is December 21  After it has considered the  comments FERC will issue a NOPR EPMI will participate in the Nov 1 meeting at FERC an update will be sent to you  I will be taking the lead on drafting our comments 20 Please contact me if you need further information Susan Lindberg 7138530596 -----Original Message-----From Jackie Gallagher mailtoJGallagherepsaorg Sent Friday October 26 2001 857 AM To acomnesenroncom Hawkins Bernadette Nersesian Carin Nicolay Christi L Fulton Donna Scheuer Janelle Hartsoe Joe Shelk John jsteffeenroncom Noske Linda J Robertson Linda Alvarez Ray Shapiro Richard Novosel Sarah Mara Susan Lindberg Susan Hoatson Tom Subject FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection Last night FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ANOPR o n Standardizing Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures  The A NOPR incorporates the ERCOT interconnection procedures modified by various best practices identified by the Commission in an attachment  A public  meeting has been scheduled for November 1st in Washington although the not ice of the meeting is not yet available  We will forward it when it become s available  The ANOPR is attached

we know what to do  Move away from the commission Also Im not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill Finally I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry While Enron wants markets that work well the core problem is that we havent deregulated enough - not that markets arent working Also I dont know where the recommendation numbers from the BushCheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have If you want to talk please let me know Thanks Jim This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s Any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited If you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to Enron Corp at enronmessagingadministrationenroncom and delete all copies of the message This e-mail and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between Enron Corp or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise Thank you -

substantive clarity of FERCs Super RTO model  The map could be augmented with information on how those regions come closer to be aligned with actual power needs and flows  I recall attending an EPSA conference for congressional staff soon after I arrived June or so which showed the crazy quilt-like map of the then-proposed RTOs that just looked unworkable  The simplicity of the Super RTO model -- combined with some basic power idea -- will be a powerful lobbying tool -----Original Message-----From Landwehr Susan M Sent Wednesday August 22 2001 644 PM To Guerrero Janel Briggs Tom Allegretti Daniel Novosel Sarah Nicolay Christi L Staines Dan Shelk John Cc Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Fromer Howard Subject RE Information request Janel----as you know most of the interaction on RTOs that I have had is with the Governors and more specifically the western govs so my comments are directed to them but I think these suggestions could work for other influencers as well RTOs are not a readily understandable issue for a governor who has 50-100 issues every week to cover nor is there a natural constituency that would politically support a governor getting involved nor is it an issue that they care about---they just want the lights to go on and their voters to have moderate prices and reliability and for the energy crisis to go away if they perceive that it is affecting them  Those that know a little bit about the RTOs are following their incumbent utility lead in opposing a west wide RTO they are invoking the states rights mantra and they dont want to be in the same  playground as California I would suggest that we need materialsinformation probably a power point of 5-8 pagesas follows 1  A description of the RTOs and generally what our position is in plain english in 3 sentences or less 2  A minimum of 2 or 3 analogies to a well designed RTO  The analogies need to be fleshed outie cover all objections and questions  The one that comes to mind is Eisenhower and the federal highway system--whenhow it happened who protested and why they were wrong how great the highway system was for the economy and quality of life etc  Governors need something they can use as a sound bite and something they understand well to use as an analogy  They do not want to look stupid and most of them know little about energy and so we need to give them something very simple to use as their underlying reasoning for supporting our position 3  Identify and describe only the the 2 or 3 most important specific issues that we need to see addressed in the RTOs---native load exemption gonecongestion management solutionstiming or whatever Steffes and team identify 4 Specifically set out what the objections of other parties would be to the governor supporting our position on those 3 issues identified  this is key in making sure that they trust our information and it also makes sure that they are prepared to answer the objections  Specifically set out what the answer is to overcome those objections 5 Provide positive effects of a governor agreeing with the 2 or 3 issues--why heshe should  take our position ie better reliability more transmission or generation will be built if system is truly open keep them from getting screwed by California etc 6  somewhere in here we also need a very simple map so they can visualize what RTOs

Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Fromer Howard Subject Information request Today I contacted our friends at Frontier Economics and at Tabors Caramanis about developing a set of talking points and leave-behinds for future RTO meetings outside of the mediation process with Governors State Legislatures Utility Commissioners and Members of Congress In order to adequately provide us with the materials we need both firms are interested in getting a better idea of the following who which individuals are raising concerns about the RTO Concept that FERCEnron are advocating what specifically are the arguments these critics are making against the single mandatory RTO concept What are the priority issues that need addressing in your regions  Well probably have to develop different documents depending on who we are talking with Each of you contacted me this week about wanting to meet with various policymakers in order to address their concerns and deliver our message  Before you schedule your meetings I think its important to arm you with materials that can be left behind that summarize andor outline your arguments for a single RTO  Your feedback is important so PLEASE send me an email by Thursday outlining the feedback youve recently received and topics that you want Frontier Economics and TC to address Time is of the essence so please send me whatever thoughts you have so that I can forward to FE and TC Thanks

42058 Date Wed 01 Aug 2001 081655 -0400 To EricEHirstcom From Eric Hirst EricEHirstcom Subject New Report on Lessons from California Mime-Version 10 Content-Type multipartalternative	boundary640249ALT Dear Colleague The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper The California Electricity Crisis Lessons for Other States which I wrote The paper is available on the Publications page of my website wwwEHirstcom  File httpwwwehirstcom   Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper Here is a summary of the paper California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future That future as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994 envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants Although the first two years of restructuring beginning in April 1998 seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disaster for Californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilities Part of the fallout from Californias electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry Although a few states have decided based on the California experience not to restructure I believe that is the wrong outcome Instead the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work competition is not to blame for Californias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand and prices affect market outcomes Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000 Section 3 the heart of this paper offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry This section makes several points Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads Ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loads maintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support large regional markets and provide fuel to power plants Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs ie couple retail and wholesale markets Create honest retail competition avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ancillary services and transmission congestion Monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation and vertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission Ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improve reliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options But this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern high-tech society electricity is our most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment Also electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state Finally competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers Eric

promises It was meant to foster competition lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians It hasnt MATTHEW C QUINN STAFF Nov 4 2001 Atlanta JournalAtlanta Constitution Home Page E1 Copyright The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2001 Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas theres widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 15 million homes and businesses the goal was to drive prices down and improve service Instead heres what resulted A relentless wave of billing errors confusion and customer service complaints Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winters record cold Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills Three marketers have gone bankrupt reducing competition Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong No easy fixes are at hand No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what theyve had to go through said Paula G Rosput chief executive of AGL Resources parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers Rosput who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably swimming against the tide Georgias relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit she said Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly Theres plenty of blame to go around here she said noting that never in the history of Georgia has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide Gov Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers but he has profound concerns about the impact on consumers Barnes said hes not out to scrap deregulation Thats a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in According to Atlanta Gas Light more than 50000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored except in certain hardship cases The PSC has allocated 10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills and the federal government has kicked in 15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers As a result social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers The Sullivan Center a southwest Atlanta nonprofit is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills Many of them havent paid since last winters frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term When the moratorium expired in April more than 220000 customers were targeted for disconnection and marketers were stuck with a reported 100 million in bad debt Since then 142000 homes and businesses have been shut off 87500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills Nancy D Coveny executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry which offers assistance to low-income residents said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies Before deregulation it was a lot easier to straighten out problems Coveny said We would call Atlanta Gas Light We had relationships High prices Jessie Champion 54 of southwest Atlanta said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a 2081 bill dating back months Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light and was told by the company that the computer messed up Shes been using an electric heater for her household which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son Catherine Land-Waters vice presidentcustomer service at Georgia Natural Gas said Champions service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas even though she sent a check Service was restored two days later but only after she yelled and screamed and complained to the PSC I have to have gas she said I have seven children Dave Benfield a spokesman for Infinite said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection The small Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment If people dont pay us in 45 days they get a notice Benfield said In most cases they pay The PSC has logged more than 12000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing billing inaccuracies disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications People arent being treated right says PSC member Stan Wise a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out and complaints to the PSC have tapered off What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months residential prices charged by marketers remained high Last week wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch Its not clear how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley Reeling from bad debt Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price which was not heavily promoted as an option A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was 3712 compared with an average of 2703 for six regulated utilities in nearby states Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service plus Atlanta Gas Lights distribution charges PSC member Robert Baker says AGLs charges which account for 40 percent of typical bills may be partly to blame for high bills On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to 525 million a year above whats authorized the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates AGL meanwhile claims its entitled to a rate increase of up to 48 million With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers its hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas What was supposed to be Georgias gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted That touched off an array of billing problems and errors When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed many consumers already angered by the billing problems blamed deregulation --- and didnt pay their bills While those problems were evolving in Georgia California had its electricity implosion Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation theyd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services including electricity and telecommunications But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power said Warren Darby retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia SC When Georgias moratorium on shut-offs expired in April marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated 100 million in bad debt Instead of building market share they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality Darby said Shell Energy an affiliate of Shell Oil Co recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas The crash program by Georgias No 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints Darby said Shell is circling the wagons Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia has not been an exciting profit picture for us but he insists his company has no plans to pull out He added however Unless things get better no company can survive this Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer has been one big headache for AGL Resources its parent which recently took a 135 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner Its not been a good business for us said Rosput of AGL No 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported 4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year or about 1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses The company says its in for the long term New Power Co made a late and aggressive entry into Georgias natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets Wall Street didnt like the idea The companys stock has plunged from 21 a year ago to less than 1 Its top financial backer Enron Corp last month wrote down about 270 million of its investment But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that its not planning to pull out Still theres concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight The top four control 94 percent of the market PSC member Baker already sees an oligopoly with limited competition Consumer choice is supposed to be the hallmark of deregulation said Commissioner David Burgess Instead he said consumers have less and less Re-regulation calls So far no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems Calls for re-regulation are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January Already a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship We cant let Georgia consumers suffer for another year said state Sen Sonny Perdue of Bonaire who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas Perdue the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor He would oppose Barnes State Rep Jimmy Skipper D-Americus the main House sponsor of the 97 law said hes concerned about gas prices but hes not sure re-regulation is doable at this point Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance We believe a year from now weather permitting that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems including dilemma No 1 If its re-regulated who takes the ball says PSC Chairman Lauren Bubba McDonald Jr Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 15 million customers which was turned over to marketers Then theres the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a bailout to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated Other measures could include new standards for billing customer service and meter reading more authority for the PSC including emergency power to regulate prices reducing the sales tax for gas bills and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for fixing deregulation In fact there may be no good fix Rosput said shes prepared to get to a solution but like everyone else she doesnt have an answer It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship she said and theres no safe shore or good place to land 713-853-9287 888-703-0309

publication from the California Manufacturers  Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento CMTA PARTICIPATES IN GOVERNORS ECONOMIC SUMMIT Press Release Today at Governor Davis Economic Summit at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank California the California Manufacturers  Technology Association CMTA proposed three recommendations to help bring immediate relief to the states faltering economy California is in a dramatic economic decline said CMTA President Jack M Stewart  Manufacturing employment is down 63000 this year and by more than 10000 jobs in September alone The states unemployment rate has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months peaking at its present 54 percent Its time for the state to implement new policies that will incent investment sooner rather than later said Stewart CMTA today will introduce proposals to Implement a Sales Tax Exemption httpwwwcmtanetpresssalestax110201  httpwwwcmtanetpresssalestax110201 on Manufacturing Processing and Telecommunications Equipment Reduce Electricity Rates httpwwwcmtanetpresselectricrates110201  httpwwwcmtanetpresselectricrates110201 and Provide Customer Choice in Energy Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees httpwwwcmtanetpressstopfees110201  httpwwwcmtanetpressstopfees110201 and Taxes These initiatives will comprise the associations focus in the coming months and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members The costs associated with a battered business community are not only measured by stock-tickers and cable financial networks  They are the human toll of jobs that are lost mortgages that fail and families that go with less added Stewart  These measures will restore confidence in every manufacturers ability to remain productive and allow them to reinvest in the states workforce Californias manufacturing sector currently produces 80 percent of state exports One sixth of state payroll 40 percent higher wages than the statewide average And for every manufacturing job an additional 1-3 jobs are produced These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help California through this economic crisis concluded Stewart BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS According to just released data from Venture Economics and  the National Venture Capital Association NVCA venture capital investment in the Bay Area during the 3rd quarter dropped 27 percent over the 2nd quarter of this year Investment has slowed significantly this year and the 3rd quarter investment is 74 percent lower than the 93 billion high reached during the 2nd quarter of 2000 The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for the 3rd quarter Venture capitalists invested 77 billion nationally during the quarter down 31 percent from the previous quarter and 73 percent from the 285 billion high of last year Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors the venture industry will persevere Veterans in our industry recognize this downturn as part of the long-term venture capital cycle Real value can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas through commented Mark Heesen NVCA President CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association CMTA and other employer organizations Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB 1197 by Senator Gloria Romero D-Los Angeles The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child parent or spouse in any absence control program Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child parent or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions  The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds high temperature sore throats etc that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care  However employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions When employees dont show up or show up late for work it negatively impacts production  In order to mitigate this problem employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling suspension and termination  After the above provision became law employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse  SB 1197 would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem In addition to insuring that production schedules are met the main reason for an employers absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled andor on time  Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning  For example if an employees attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes no disciplinary action could be taken In other instances it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late SB 1197 would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy  Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees  CMTA discussed with legislators the counter-productive nature of restricting an employers ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those employees who have trouble getting to work under SB 1197 and could end up eliminating the benefit for all employees  CMTA applauds

CHI Subject	Crains Article -- October 15 2001 ComEd seeks rate hike for biz Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators Crains -- October 15 2001 By Steve Daniels mailtosdanielscraincom Commonwealth Edison Co is pressing for another big hike in its charges for delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers The Chicago utilitys Aug 31 filing with federal regulators to nearly double transmission rates - for carrying electricity over its long-haul high-voltage lines for these customers - has triggered opposition from state regulators That request followed a June proposal for a 37 increase in distribution charges for moving power through the utilitys more local lower-voltage wires Crains June 11 That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC If approved the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and distribution costs by about 50 for business customers that leave the utility for competing power suppliers Perhaps more important the new rates would clear the way for delivery charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicago-area power users in three years when a freeze on ComEds rates expires Transmission and distribution rates account for 20 to 25 of a typical business customers total power bill - so a typical bill could rise as much as 10 with these increases Apart from the bottom-line hit to businesses ComEd competitors and local government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from offering savings from the utilitys bundled rate AES NewEnergy Inc the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more than 800 customers says 86 of its customers will see their bills increase if both proposals are approved What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the point where bundled utility service is cheaper or its so close that they wouldnt bother choosing an alternative provider says Philip OConnor president of AES NewEnergys Chicago office You cannot have competition being viable when your base of potential customers is so small Arlene Juracek ComEd vice-president of regulatory and strategic services counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a corresponding decrease in transition fees paid to the utility when customers use another supplier The Aug 31 transmission rate proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEds account methodology in which the utility would wipe off its books more than 660 million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask ratepayers to shoulder that investment again Unjust and unreasonable In its filing with FERC the ICC said the proposed change would result in artificially high transmission rates and an unjust and unreasonable windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers Theyre essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the game says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill ComEd responds that FERC itself - in an order last year pushing utilities to combine their transmission assets into large regional networks - said utilities could consider changing the accounting method ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of parent company Exelon Corp to receive compensation in accordance with what is permissible by law says Steven T Naumann ComEd vice-president in charge of transmission services The commission will determine if this is what they meant in their order or if it is not what they meant Meanwhile the city of Chicago frustrated by ComEds resistance to sharing detailed financial data is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an outside audit of ComEds books for 2000 The state attorney generals office and the Cook County states attorneys office are joining the city in the petition which could be filed as early as Monday sources say The audit which ComEd opposes would be aimed at separating ordinary maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took in 1999 and 2000 to beef up its distribution system after acknowledging it had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades The behind-the-scenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government officials are taking the regulatory proceedings While the new rates affect only those customers in the competitive market theyll be the benchmark used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in 2005 when the utilitys bundled rates are no longer frozen Setting the rules The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future are getting set now says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment Basically the next 36 months are going to set an awful lot of the fees for the future Mr Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure ComEd into opening its books but says it wouldnt be necessary if the company agreed to do so voluntarily A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a blanket confidentiality agreement - which intervenors in the case including the city arent likely to sign Ms Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs associated with its 15-billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate base But she allows that most of those are minimal tree-trimming expenses Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers as well as contractor expenses are included in the rates Theres no free lunch here she says Says Mr Abolt Now its time to sort that all out So lets sort it out David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick  Wolfe 203 North LaSalle Street Suite 1500 Chicago Illinois  60601 phone  312-368-3462 fax  312-630-7418 e-mail  davidfeinpiperrudnickcom The information contained in this communication may be confidential is intended only for the use of the recipient named above and may be legally privileged  If the reader of this message is not the intended recipient you are hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this communication or any of its contents is strictly prohibited If you have received this communication in error please re-send this communication to the sender and delete the original message and any copy of it from your computer system Thank you For more information about Piper Marbury Rudnick  Wolfe please visit us at httpwwwpiperrudnickcom

Robert C Cc	Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Hughes Evan Steffes James D Subject	ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION All I finally got an answer from PGE concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access  PGE admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations PGE then transferred these debit balances on to the customers first utility bill  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices  They had been told by PGE that Enron had refused to pay the final bills  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PGE so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved  However I have not sent a written request  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request We also have an issue with SCE  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access   If you recall their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts  If that is indeed their process this is

Creditworthiness Issues Unlike TX creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers ARES in IL is not uniform accross utility lines The creditworthiness standards vary by utility and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES However the single billing option SBO has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative Enrons Credit Rating of BBBSP and Baa2Moodys General Creditworthiness Under Section 45150 Subchapter C of the IL Admin Code as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement In IL EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more To secure this license EES was required to post bond in the sum of 30000 The bond is valid for one year and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES If the license bond is cancelled modified expires or is drawn upon EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount The EES license bond expired on June 2001 EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002 and annually thereafter Registration Under SubPart B EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more Subpart B has additional financial qualifications 1 To maintain certification under Subpart B EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- SP Baa3 Moodys BBB- Duff 	 Phelps or BBB- Fitch or 2  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall not be less than 500000 or 5 of EES revenue for last fiscal year or 3 Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in an amount not less than  	500000 or 5 of EESs revenue for the last fiscal year or 4 Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES contractual failure This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year or 5 EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of 500000 or 5 of its revenue for last fiscal year from an A rated financial 	insitution or 6 EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage funds from operations interest coverage funds from operations to total debt and total debt 	to total capital Enrons Credit Rating and downgrades To satisfy the Subpart B requirements EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp Given our current credit rating of BBBSP and Baa2 Moodys that guaranty is still valid However if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness IMPACT The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EESs ability to do business in IL Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license This will trigger contractual default for all our customers both financial and physical Please note that EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP Single Bill Option Pursuant to Section 451500 Subpart F any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option SBO must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities monies that it collects under the SBO tariff To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards EES must either 1 Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15 of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO 2 Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an A rating 3 Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings a BBB- SP Baa3 Moodys BBB-duff Phelps BBB- Fitch 4 Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings Enrons Current Rating EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3 or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings EES is not rated However given Enron Corps current credit rating of BBB and Baa2 a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff Further Downgrades If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings EES will need to provide a bond or LC or forego the SBO option IMPACT EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical However there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables Instrument Fund Charges akin to stranded costs Under the Illinois tariffs EES can choose annually one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges 1 To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment or more frequently as required or 2 within 15 days of utility invoicing whether or not customer has paid If EES chooses the 2nd option it has to provide a security deposit equal to one months estimated IFC charges for all EES customers Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage and the IFC charge per KWH If the expected IFC charge for EES customers is 5000000 or more this deposit amount will be revised monthly If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing we will be required to provide the deposit IMPACT This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd For ComEd IFC charges nets out to zero and customers do not pay those charges EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IPs service territory and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement If EES chooses the first remittance option it will avoid the deposit requirement However this may have operational implications

EPSA meeting last Thurs the GISB people clearly stated that GISB has NO authority over its members it is 100 voluntary  All the muscle lies in FERC and any governmental agency that is willing to adopt the GISB standard  Agencies in Mexico for example have adopted certain GISB standards  In fact ANSI acreditaion requires that the standards setting organization NOT to have authority  So it makes sense for FERC to not amend a proposed standard since other agencies will have to be able to adopt iteg- Canada  I dont see a problem with this - but this makes the consensus building process even more important since the final product must be amenable to any and all relevant governement authorities This is a good reason why the legislation cannot give deference to the ERO especially one which proposes to have compliance and enforcement authority as NERCs proposal  If NERC is going to set standards AND have compliance authority over its members - then the ANSI acreditation they claim to be getting will not be the same as that of GISB  ANSI does not allow this combination  If the deference language is in the legislation - that means the GISBEISB proposal is excluded from FERCs choice  FERC needs to be aware of this  So why does the voluntary GISB process with FERC oversight model work It is the very nature of knowing FERC has final authority that makes the consensus building process work - not the threat of the EROs compliance authority over its members as NERC approaches this  In GISB the  members know that if they do not produce a standard that all its members and FERC can live with - FERC will not adopt it nor can FERC amend it - and since no enforcement mechanism will be behind the mis-guided standard remember it is 100 voluntary it becomes a worthless exercise  This is a powerful incentive On the other hand NERCs approach of a standards organization with enforcement power sets the stage for power struggles between sectors and knocks down the consensus building attitude the GISB process encourages   Compliance and penalites are not assigned or targeted to every membersector  Certain parties are impacted by certain standards - and in different ways For example - a congestion management standard will affect a control area very differently than it would a power marketer  The penalites may not apply at all to the marketers who want to protect themselves by making the congestion management penalites as harsh as possible and vice versa for the control areas  If the ERO doles out compliance without FERC approval - then the standards will become a battleground over compliance and penalties The point is the enforcement and penalty debate will drive sector arguments and will cloud the real task of developing an equitable congestion management standard -----Original Message-----From 	Shelk John Sent	Friday August 10 2001 358 PM To	Shapiro Richard Robertson Linda Steffes James D Novosel Sarah Yeung Charles Perrino Dave Rodriquez Andy Ingersoll Richard Nicolay Christi L Lindberg Susan Walton Steve Subject	Summary of Final Draft of NERC Electric Reliability Organization Legislation Attached is a summary I did of the key points in the Final Draft of the NERC reliability legislation as amended yesterday  While it is now shorter than the old version and some of the objectional features have been deleted or watered down I assume we still do not support the final version  We and others who attended these meetings have been asked to provide our comments and position by close of business on Thursday August 16th  I thought the summary would help highlight the major features so we can evaluate the final version in light of our concerns and interests in this subject  Your comments are welcome  File SummaryNERCFinalDraft081001doc

direct assignment of the CSC congestion costs takes place then flowing across the CSC does have a cost and those who schedule across will be more judicious  The second assumption is that the stakeholders chose the wrong limiting element to be the monitored constraint  90 of the congestion charges can be attributed to that wrong element  If direct assignmnet of the congestion andor designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model  John Meyer Shmuel Oren and most parties would agree with that

Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc Robertson Linda Ryall Jean Subject RE FERC Looking at ERCOT Here are a couple of clarifying points The congestion charges that have been incurred are 556 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept 22 2001 was 556 MM  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14 2001 ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion rather a direct assignment of the charge  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion -----Original Message-----From Steffes James D

not addressed  We will try to confirm this tomorrow As lawyers please do not hesitate to call or email if we can be of any further assistance  Christopher J Townsend  Piper Marbury Rudnick  Wolfe  203

argued that the Commission should address energy imbalances in the proceeding  Enron and NewEnergy abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly addressed within Edisons OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition the Commission would not address the propriety of FERCs asserted authority over energy imbalance issues  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at some future time 2	Factual  Policy Issues Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers containing the following provisions 	Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hours imbalances 	For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2 or less or 2 MW or less settlement is made at 100 of out-of-pocket costs OPC regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error 	Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25 of their own individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25 of OPC  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discounts applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount below  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows 	From October 1 1999 through December 31 1999 -- No adder  will apply under this provision 	From January 1 2000 through March 31 2000 -- 25 adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25 of their schedules 20 or more of the hours of the month  If the 20 of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours 	Starting April 1 2000 -- 25 adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25 of their schedules 10 or more of the hours of the month  If the 10 of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours 	Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs  If the hourly imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load excluding PPO load is within the 100 MW bandwidth no RES except those whose imbalance exceeds 25 as noted below will be subject to an adder or discount  PPO load will in aggregate be subject to the same terms and conditions as above but imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadband separately from all RES load 	Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish before applying a charge for energy imbalance  According to Edison this feature will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging overscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the same hour  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100 of Edisons OPC  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the opening of the trading window 	The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be charged an adder or discount of 10  This charge will be allocated among RESs who are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds their individual deadband  The allocation will be based on the ratio-share of the amount by which these individual RESs imbalances exceed their individual deadbands  Any such adderdiscount will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Likewise any adderdiscount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading 	Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with seasonal adjustments  Edison will not require the installation of interval demand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time 	Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth ie no addersdiscounts when the imbalances are due to 1 Edison interruptions and restorations or 2 customer force majeure events that are in each case material to the RESs schedule and of which the RES could not reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule 	Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC The IIEC opposed Edisons proposal and requested that the Commission require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution level  Blackhawk also opposed Edisons proposal and supported the IIEC proposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy imbalance service at the distribution level  Mid-American opposed any effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issue consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for such issues  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in some future FERC proceeding The information contained in this

Message-----From 	Shelk John Sent	Thursday August 16 2001 305 PM To	Shapiro Richard Robertson Linda Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Briggs Tom Alvarez Ray Shortridge Pat Long Chris Nersesian Carin Subject	Report on Anti-RTO Bill and on Andy Black Meeting This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments the Aug 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill or at least anti-mandatory RTOs and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall 1  HR 2814 Reps Tom Sawyer D-OH and Richard Burr R-NC On Aug 2nd the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced HR 2814 the Interstate Transmission Act  The legislation is bad because among other things it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs  Also objectionable is that the bill would limit pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a reasonable transition mechanism or period for additive charges  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form structure and operating entity of any RTO In addition to the RTO language the bill has the old version of the NERC reliability legislation in it  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs repeals Federal Power Act sec 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep Sawyers district  Rep Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue  Rep Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant see Andy Black comment below 2  Andy Black Meeting Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron Reliant Dynegy and TXU  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee  Here is a run down of my comments and Andys comments on specific issues a   RTOs Chairman Barton supports RTOs  At a minimum the draft will affirm FERCs authority as the commissioners have requested  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps  However Andy asked me to look at sec 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs  Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects  I will strongly encourage him to do the right thing in that regard b   PUHCA The draft will use the Pickering bill HR 1101  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enrons records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate c  PURPA Prospective repeal  On back up power they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state d   Interconnection They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like  I am contacting EPSA to get the details e   Net Metering They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require net metering  I explained our concern that the bills mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES per Jims helpful comments yesterday  I need to get more information to Andy f   Transmission Jurisdiction Thankfully Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction  Specifically the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundledunbundled issue at all  The draft will bring munis co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes g   Siting On siting Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches h   Reliability On a negative note Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERCs version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support ie not PJM  I explained our concerns  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate i   Negawatts I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list  He said he is open to considering it again but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the California bill earlier this summer Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome

LMP in the real-time  He did not however confirm that NG w as indifferent 309I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his p oint 1  NG may simply have misstated its intentions  But clearly this po sition makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I they would  be giving up too much 409I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownersh ip of some but not necessarily all transmission plant in its footprint 509Lets try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the Londo n office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market Luiz -  Can you please develop some questions  talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meetin g Thanks -----Original Message-----From 09Roan Michael 20 Sent09Monday November 12 2001 314 PM To09Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Maurer Luiz Stroup Kerry Subject09RE Alliance Just been through the paper and have the following thoughts or concerns dep ending on your viewpoint 1  The model is inconsistent with the approach taken by FERC  NG propose  that every transco sets its own rates runs its own OASIS and manages cong estionhow can this ensure seamless practices within each RTO footprin t  I suggest the opposite will occur that is balkanization  For example Transcos can join MISO under Appendix I and a number are proposing to do so  Based on NGs proposed split of functions each transco could join MI SO with its own tx rates OASIS platform and congestion protocol regardless of whether they are consistent  Under this scenario transmission rates an d markets would remain balkanized and vary depending on transmission compan y geographic reach similar to today 2  NG state that the benefit of a for profit entity is that it can and w ill manage risk commercially i agree  However NG miss the point hereI f an RTOISO is a non profit organisation it will only provide services su ch as tariff admin OASIS and congestion management such an RTO will not  own tx assetsthe tx companies that it provides services on behalf of w ill continue to do so  In providing these services the RTOISO only mana ges risk associated with non provision of service not the underlying trans mission delivery risk  The transmission companies for whom the RTO provid es services will continue to be for profit entities and will continue to manage risks commercially RTO benefits result primarily from aggregation  of services not from more appropriate commercial risk managementthere is nothing to stop tx owners from managing risk more effectively regardless  of proposed RTO structure  For example NG as a transco Translink or Cine rgy transmission could propose liquidated damage clauses for overselling fi rm transmission under the non profit RTO structure  Likewise NG as transco and RTO could make the same proposal  Commercial form is a second order  issue 3  NG should have concentrated on supporting FERC policy 4 RTOs rather  than stating one parties view on separation of RTO functions between profit non profit entities  FERC policy suggests that the key structural issues  are increasing market size 4 regional markets and third party access l evel playing field  This was the basis for the CGM proposal that came ou t of the SE mediation  Separating CM and OATT admin from planning and sec urity coord improves third party access to real time information which in  turn will facilitate market based investment decision making being investm ent in transmission generation or DSM  Suggesting that transmission inve stment is necessary to resolve existing transmission constraints either sho ws ignorance or more likely the conflict that NG hasi suggest that inves tment in generation or DSM could resolve the problems just as adequately 4  The model seems to be based on the assumption that transmission charges will continue to be based on contract path congestion managed through r edispatch  I assume that NG and other transmission companies prefer thi s approach as it allows them to both maximise cash returns above appropria te regulated rates and control information that facilitates new investment retain monopoly  I agree with Jim that this suggests a physical approac h to congestion management  NGs concept that third parties can energy ma rkets is consistent with the ARTO approach ie allowing an APX to provid e day ahead market functions for example  I would propose that a transco should not care what tx charging methodology was in place as long as it i s perceived to be reasonable by customers and receives its aggregate regula ted revenue requirement  Thus CM and OATT administration are not core tran sco functions at all In summary I suggest that NG actually propose the paper to reflect a for  profit RTO but they do not state this anywhere even if true they do not  state anywhere that a transco should have consistent OATT and CM protocols if the assets they own are non contiguous or the transco has a number of  owners I agree with Luiz that in this form it is a hard sell and does not resolve Enrons ongoing concerns regards Mike 20 -----Original Message-----From 09Maurer Luiz 20 Sent09Tuesday November 06 2001 1057 AM To09Steffes James D Subject09RE Alliance Jim As per your request I examined the attached doc Response of National Grid US to Questions posed by the  Com  File National Grid Transco White Pap erdoc  m ission My initial reaction is 1 The simple answer to your question is yes I think the proposed governa nce and organization structure can live with an LMP model I am not familia r with other MISO CM model but at least in terms of LMP my feeling is tha t those are not mutually exclusive It may be worth asking Ashley Brown 2 National Grid and other proponents of For-Profit-Transcos may have other ideas on how to manage congestions eg different reliability level produ cts by customer segment However the attached paper makes no allusion to  avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models The paper do es not imply a physical model either Your feeling may be right but it doe s not surface from the paper per se 3 National Grid proposal is in fact an expanded version of the Southeast Model proposed at the Mediation It reinforces the role of the Transco Com pany preempting to some extent the role of the System Admininstrator Th is was a very controversial topic in the mediation the System Adminstrator was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias  particularly fr om transmission companies who are not willingable to transfer their T asse ts 4 National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea Your concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are  surfaced in the paper by creating a concept of core vs additional fun ctions and a chinese wall if necessary  But the perception of potential b ias does exist National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in  s elling  this idea Particularly when we get to the details LM -----Original Message-----From 09Steffes James D 20 Sent09Monday November 05 2001 450 PM To09Maurer Luiz Stroup Kerry Roan Michael Nicolay

we know what to do  Move away from the commission Also Im not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill Finally I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry While Enron wants markets that work well the core problem is that we havent deregulated enough - not that markets arent working Also I dont know where the recommendation numbers from the BushCheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have If you want to talk please let me know Thanks Jim This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s Any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited If you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to Enron Corp at enronmessagingadministrationenroncom and delete all copies of the message This e-mail and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between Enron Corp or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise Thank you -

Therefore I have cut and paste the document and attached it to my e-mail INFORMATIONAL HEARING Proposed Rate Agreement Between The California Department Of Water Resources And The California Public Utilities Commission State Capitol Room 2040 August 21 2001 130 pm --------------------------------------------------------------------------------I Opening Comments Senator Debra Bowen Chairwoman Senate Energy Utilities  Communications Committee Senator Bill Morrow Vice-Chairman Senate Energy Utilities  Communications Committee II Panelists Stan Dirks California Department of Water Resources Chris Warner Pacific Gas  Electric Gary Schoonyan Southern California Edison Jim Hay San Diego Gas  Electric Mike Florio The Utility Reform Network Dave Morse Office of Ratepayer Advocates Dan Carroll California Industrial Users Douglas Heller Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Bill Julian California Public Utilities Commission BACKGROUND At the peak of Californias electricity crisis two of Californias investor-owned utilities were financially unable to purchase electricity on behalf of their customers AB 1x Keeley Chapter 4 Statutes of 2001 authorized the California Department of Water Resources DWR to begin buying power on behalf of the customers of those two utilities and San Diego Gas  Electric ratepayers as well as to issue bonds to finance such purchases DWR wasnt authorized to utilize the credit of the state to back those purchases Instead it was authorized to recover the money needed to pay for its electricity purchases through electric rates charged to consumers and to perform is own reasonableness review of those costs The California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC discretion to perform a reasonableness review is rarely abrogated an exception being the costs of collective bargaining agreements but AB 1x made an exception in this case for two basic reasons First if the CPUC decided to preclude certain power costs from being passed along to ratepayers the effect would be to simply shift those costs from ratepayers to taxpayers Second the goal of a reasonableness review which is to create an incentive to do the best possible job on behalf of the ratepayers could be accomplished through DWR s accountability to ratepayers The theory was the political process would provide the check on DWRs activities much in the same way customers provide a check on the activities of a municipal utility To fulfill its obligations under AB 1x DWR spent 76 billion through May 2001 That money was originally loaned from the General Fund In addition the state obtained a short-term bank loan of 43 billion to help pay for ongoing electricity purchases That short-term loan the outstanding debt owed to the General Fund and the difference between actual electricity costs and electricity rates paid to DWR will all be financed through a 125 billion bond offering which was authorized by SB 31x Burton Chapter 9 Statutes of 2001 and may take place as early as October DWR has stated that the bond offering is contingent upon the CPUC taking a number of actions on August 23 2001 one of which is to approve the DWR-constructed Rate Agreement Agreement between DWR and the CPUC The Agreement provides the irrevocable contractual and enforceable assurance that the CPUC will allow DWRs electricity power purchase costs to be recovered in a timely manner Specifically the Agreement Creates a Rate Covenant where the CPUC acknowledges DWRs right to recover its self-determined revenue requirement as specified Defines DWRs revenue requirement to include the repayment of the bonds the cost of DWRs electricity procurement including the long-term contracts administrative consulting and legal costs and the cost of demand management programs Requires the CPUC to establish rates to allow recovery of DWRs revenue requirement within 30 days or 90 days as determined by DWR Authorizes DWR to take the CPUC to court to enforcement its provisions DWR has stated the Agreement is an essential element to obtaining the bond financing JP Morgan the senior managing underwriter for the DWR bonds has similarly stated that without the Agreement the bonds wont be viewed as investment grade quality thereby jeopardizing the bond issuance The Agreement is currently being considered by the CPUC A number of parties including small and large consumer groups who will be responsible for paying the rates along with the investor-owned utilities have commented on DWRs proposed Agreement and raised a number of concerns The Treasurer has offered some suggested amendments to the Agreement to try and answer some of the concerns without impairing his ability to sell the bonds Issues  Questions The Committee May Wish To Consider Must an Agreement be Signed AB 1x permits the CPUC to enter into a rate agreement with DWR but such an agreement is not required by the statute Given the irrevocable nature of DWRs proposed Agreement is it necessary for the CPUC to approve the agreement or will some other less binding agreement suffice One alternate approach to the Agreement is SB 18xx Burton which provides a dedicated rate to pay for the bonds and specifies exactly what DWR may include as a part of its costs SB 18xx passed the Senate 35-2 on July 20 2001 and is pending at the Assembly desk Public Review DWRs revenue requirement at least as it pertains to power purchase costs bond repayment and associated administrative costs clearly isnt subject to CPUC review or adjustment pursuant to AB 1x Rather than have an independent party like the CPUC review its efforts AB 1x envisioned that public review and accountability would motivate DWR to do the best possible job to get the best value possible for ratepayers However the Agreement neither contemplates nor provides for public review which has raised concerns from a number of parties about what costs beyond the cost of buying power DWR is attempting to pass along to ratepayers as a part of the Agreement Scope of Revenue Requirement AB 1x specifically permits DWR to cover the cost of the bonds power purchases and associated administrative costs The Agreement submitted by DWR to the CPUC for adoption allows DWR to recover much more than those costs including the cost of demand management programs and legal consulting and technical services By including such costs in the Agreement these costs are subject to neither legislative nor public review The demand management programs have historically been the purview of the CPUC The California Independent System Operator has attempted this year to create and administer some of these programs with mixed success However DWR has no background in demand management and no public process for considering and approving such programs Given the lack of a public process and DWRs lack of expertise on demand management programs is it appropriate to allow DWR to include the unknown costs of these programs in the Agreement 30 and 90 Day Review The Agreement requires the CPUC to review and implement rates which allow DWR to recover its revenue requirement within 90 days or 30 days if DWR finds that an expedited change is necessary This is an extremely short window of time for the CPUC to analyze any DWR request and provide for full public review and comment Auditing DWRs revenue requirement will be tens of billions of dollars which will be paid for exclusively by the ratepayers of the states investor-owned utilities Despite the fact that billions of dollars will be changing hands the Agreement fails to include an auditing requirement to ensure that appropriate revenues are provided to DWR that surplus revenues are returned to ratepayers and that there is ongoing monitoring of DWRs accounts Court Challenges The purpose of the rate agreement is to facilitate the issuance of the bonds to repay the General Fund and the short-term loan Its possible that some party may challenge this Agreement or any of the other related CPUC decisions ie establishing the DWR revenue requirement creating a servicing agreement between DWR and the utilities etc in either federal or state court How will such a challenge effect the issuance of the bonds Contract Renegotiation The DWR contracts negotiated at the height of the energy crisis are viewed by some as expensive The state and ratepayers would certainly be better off if those contracts can be renegotiated based upon current circumstances The Agreement binds the CPUC to set rates sufficient for DWR to recover its revenue requirement including the cost of the contracts it has already signed Does the signing of this Agreement diminish DWRs ability or incentive to renegotiate any of the contracts Does it eliminate any incentive DWR has to negotiate the best possible price on any future contracts that it may sign since the costs of those contracts wont be subject to review or adjustment

TransmissionRTOs John Thanks for the analysis and talking points  theyre great and Im incorporating some of it almost verbatim as Im working on the letter  Well get a draft to you soon so that we can have this letter ready for when Congress returns I have one question regarding the Sawyer-Burr bill in Section 3 there is a paragraph on negotiated rates  This is basically the same paragraph that was in the draft legislation we discussed in the DeLay meetings in July and it is also in the Landrieu draft transmission legislation  What is your interpretation of this negotiated rates section  I cant think of a situation in which this would be beneficial to transmission users and I cant really figure out how this would even work in an RTO After talking to a couple of regulatory people all I can think is that this section is meant for the benefit of transmission owners who are thinking in an Order 888-type system where it could be possible for individual transmission owners to negotiate a rate deal if this provision were enacted Any feedback Thanks Andrea Andrea L Spring Electric Power Supply Association phone 202-628-8200x124 fax 202-628-8260 1401 New York Ave NW 11th Floor Washington DC 20005 wwwepsaorg  Shelk John JohnShelkENRONcom 82701 44417 PM  This note follows up on our discussion at the EPSA Leg Affairs Committee meeting last week  We very much appreciate EPSAs willingness to send a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on HR 2814 the Sawyer-Burr legislation introduced on August 2nd as part of a broader effort to educate committee members about the serious problems with this legislation First as we discussed while the overall transmission thrust of the bill is largely acceptable there are two major problems 1 there are anti-RTOpro-voluntary RTO nuggets see below and 2 the bill has the old or old old NERC reliability language The anti-RTOpro-voluntary RTO nuggets are as follows 1	Sec 3 transmission pricing page 5  You will note that the bill says that the required FERC transmission pricing regulations shall provide incentives to utilities to promote voluntary RTOs without having the effect of forcing utilities to join RTOs the regulations shall limit pancaking but not during a reasonable transition period and in any event transmission rates can be based on a single utilitys costs 2	Sec 6 voluntary development of RTOs starting on page 40  The bill requires FERC to approve RTOs where the participation is voluntary  Of particular note is page 40 lines 21-23 which says that the form structure and operating entity of the RTO must be approved by the participating utilities  At a minimum this language gives the utilities a veto over other market participants  This could also be read as saying the utilities and only the transmitting utilities make these critical governance decisions without participation by others The section prohibits FERC from conditioning any order under the Federal Power Act on a utility transferring operational control of facilities to an ISO or RTO Second we agreed that some talking points are needed to include in the letter and in our lobbying  A review of the rest of the bill shows that we can actually use the general thrust of the bill against the sponsors as follows below  We need to let them save face by separating the pro-transmission system features of the bill from the anti-RTO language Please let me know if EPSA wishes to write a draft for review or whether you wish us to supply one  The suggested talking points are a	EPSA welcomes the bills acknowledgment of the importance of improving the transmission system generally and the critical role of RTOs in particular eg sec 7 of the bill has a central role for RTOs in siting of key transmission lines b	EPSA agrees that transmission pricing is important to providing incentives to improve the transmission system c	However EPSA also believes that it is inappropriate to tie FERCs hands on RTOs in the name of improving the system when reducing FERCs authority will make it harder not easier to improve the transmission system FERC tried a voluntary approach to RTOs and it has been painfully slow RTOs need to be of a size and configuration that parallels natural trading markets and power flows and this is not a federal v state issue as regions exist and would be encouraged under the bill the real question is what type of regions perhaps this latter point goes before the one on size and scope d	Congress can address the transmission pricing and siting issues without the voluntary RTO language e	Point out the problems with the NERC reliability language Let me know how EPSA wishes to proceed  We strongly recommend that the final letter go out next week so it is received as Congress returns from the August

Request for Comments The current Grid SouthARTOMISOSPP scheduling model moves only limited types of transactions to the RTO  That is those schedules that are for through transactions  If a schedule starts or stops sourcesink within an existing control area - that control area retains the ability to approvedeny the tag the bastards  Only if the control area is in the middle or an intermediary control area in the transaction path will they not have to approve the tags  What then is the value of the RTO other than a tariff coordinator  My view is that control areas should relinquish all tag approval rights AND OASIS approval rights to the RTO  They will argue that the telemetry and analysis tools is not at the RTO to do this So - why not At a meeting Thursday to finalize the waiver for NERC approval their arguments ran into a stumbling block  Policy 3 requires that source and sink control areas must communicate directly to coordinate TLR  Rather than seeking an exception to doing this - they all felt it best to maintain this responsibility at the source and sink control area and not assign it to the RTO Scheduling Agent  With approvals and curtailments kept at the control area level this jeopardizes independent judgment -----Original Message-----From 	Steffes James D Sent	Thursday August 30 2001 833 PM To	Yeung Charles Nicolay Christi L Maurer Luiz Novosel Sarah Fulton Donna Connor Joe Subject	RE RTO Waiver -

Request for Comments Hello  SE RTO folks I know you all have a ton and half things going on - but I would like for you to look over the attached proposal that will be a waiver for existing control areas to assign certain control area functions over to a central RTO operator  This waiver was originally intended for Grid South but since has expanded to include Alliance SPP MISO  The purpose of the waiver is to allow for the continued existence of individual utility based control areas within an RTO AND to fulfill the FERC Order 2000 requirement that the RTO to implement Interchange Schedules  This may become a direct conflict with our position for consolidation of control areas If you dont read anything else I advise you to at least read - Sec 22 Rationale - 5 brief paragraphs which outlines what the RTOs want to do Since I am chairman of the NERC Subcommittee that oversees Policy 3 Enron is associated with facilitating this process  I want those working at the settlement conferences to be aware that this is coming  Grid Souths original intent was to change sections of Policy 3 to fit their new RTO structure  I successfully argued against doing this on the basis that NERC policy should not prescribe the Grid South scheduling process and control area structure as reliability policy - hence the waiver Charles Yeung 713-853-0348 -----Original Message-----From 	owner-rtoschedulenerccomENRON mailtoIMCEANOTES-owner-rtoschedule40nerc2Ecom40ENRONENRONcom  On Behalf Of Gordon Scott GordonScottnercnet Sent	Monday August 27 2001 1209 PM To	rtoschedulenerccom Subject	RTO Waiver -

excetralcaldwellwilliamscom jamesbruggemanwilliamscom janemudgettwilliamscom MarkBeckerwilliamscom waymansmithwilliamscom Subject Future FERC Involvement and Proposed Schedule for SoutheastRTO UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Regional Transmission Organizations		Docket No RT01-100-000 To Honorable Bobbie J McCartney The Electric Power Supply Association EPSA has welcomed the opportunity to give you input during the Southeast mediation proceeding  EPSA and its members would like to thank you and your team for taking time from the proceeding to share your insights hear our views and answer our questions  We now want to provide you with additional input from generators and marketers in the form of proposed milestones and deadlines regarding continued FERC involvement after the mediation  We recognize your schedule and hope these brief points will be appropriate prior to your receipt of responses to the strawmen FERCs Continued Involvement EPSA strongly supports FERCs continued involvement in the development of one Regional Transmission Organization RTO for the Southeast  EPSA believes such continued involvement is critical to achieving RTO market operations in the Southeast as soon as possible  We cannot overestimate the damage to market efficiency and consumer benefits that result from continued delays to full competition a problem that plagues the entire country It was very encouraging to hear of your support for this involvement and desire to get input from market participants regarding how this can be done after the 45-day settlement period has ended  EPSA would like to make procedural suggestions for the post-mediation period that would include continued Commission involvement that is deemed critical to the formation of a single Southeast RTO  We hope that the following suggestions are helpful when you are developing your report to the Commission on the mediation results The Southeast Power Grid model will be an evolutionary process following the end of the mediation  Several issue areas are still likely to be the focus of significant debate and will require a collaborative process that the stakeholders will remain responsible for establishing  Resolving these issues and more importantly their associated details will be critical to the enduring success of the eventual Southeast Power Grid The Commissions continued involvement is critical to the formation of a seamless power grid  Additionally regional market participants can benefit from first-hand FERC input on previous rulings from other regions  This can help prevent any future Southeast Power Grid filings from attempting to establish rules protocols and plans that are contrary to Commission precedent  Moreover it prevents disagreements between stakeholders on specific points from stalling the process and potentially resulting in a deficient filing  Potentially FERC will incur added costs of travel and staff time however filings that follow FERCs current thinking will more than offset these costs The Commissions presence in the process going forward will prevent any future delay by providing ongoing dialogue between regulators and market participants  This will shortcut the time-consuming sequence of 1 internal negotiations 2 filing 3 filing response and hopefully obviate the need for going through the sequence repeatedly  FERC presence will also help prevent parties from becoming polarized in their views during negotiations without feeling a need to compromise Future stakeholder meetings in the Southeast Power Grid process will work best by involving two FERC staff representatives and to avoid ex-parte concerns EPSA recognizes that any meeting attended by Commission staff must be publicly noticed These Commission staff representatives need to be knowledgeable of the Southeast process and can serve as back-ups to one another  Consequently if a situation arises where one staffer cannot participate in a meeting the alternate should be able to stand in as a proxy for the other Commission representative The mediation process will have its value increased if the Commissions staff representatives are empowered to correct procedural problems that emerge in the process as it moves forward  For example if the Commissions staff finds that meeting minutes do not reflect stakeholder decisions or consensus on a given issue or they are not being disseminated to process participants in a systematic manner they can ensure that problems are rectified  Making expedient changes as the subsequent process unfolds after the 45-day mediation period is over will confirm that the successes of the mediation continue and that parties continue to work collaboratively Staff involvement will give the Commission the ability to monitor the process during the post-mediation period  If questions arise during post-mediation period staff can supply on-the-spot answers or coordinate with senior staff to get answers to the parties quickly  The efficiency of this established feedback channel ensures that negotiations between parties do not bog down and hinder the completion of the overall process over a single issue  Moreover the presence of Commission staff assists in maintaining a cooperative approach between the parties as is evidenced in our mediation process Having Commission representatives in the field for the Southeast Power Grid process can prove valuable as a way for FERC to continue to engage state public utility commissions and remain responsive to their concerns as details about the Grid organization get refined  The involvement of state commissions is integral to the success of more competitive wholesale markets in the Southeast  A FERC presence going forward will allow federal and state regulators to confer on the benefits to consumers of successful competitive wholesale and ultimately retail power markets  State regulators comfort level could be increased if the process continues with an ongoing FERC presence Proposed Milestones and Deadlines The following schedule still assumes some form of convergence between the existing structures  EPSA continues to believe that a single Southeast RTO can be formed in a timely manner that will provide certainty to the market steadily reduce business risks for those who have and will invest in the Southeast and provide

Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc Robertson Linda Ryall Jean Subject RE FERC Looking at ERCOT Here are a couple of clarifying points The congestion charges that have been incurred are 556 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept 22 2001 was 556 MM  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14 2001 ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion rather a direct assignment of the charge  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially

LaJuneBushaolcom Subject     CMTA Energy Leg Update from Dorothy TO CMTA Energy Committee FROM      Dorothy Rothrock SUBJECT Legislative Update As of this morning we have not seen language from the Senate to replace the SBX2 78 that passed out of the Assembly last week  Rumors are that the elements of SBX2 78 will be broken apart into separate bills put into Assembly bills now in the Senate and sent over to the Assembly for concurrence today or tomorrow  There will probably be a hearing in Senate Energy this afternoon on the issues We have been working to gain bipartisan support for direct access assuming that it will be pulled from the MOU and run as a separate bill if at all It is likely that direct access as a stand alone issue does not have the votes because of concerns about small customer opposition and a big business jail break  Our only chance is a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats that requires the CPUC to suspend direct access letting customers currently on direct access maintain and renew their contracts and hopefully preserving the right for future direct access without fees if there is net short  Given the short time we have left and that we have no leverage if the issue is separate from the SCE MOU I fear this is a long shot In the absence of legislation to overturn ABX1 1 the CPUC will probably suspend direct access later this month  The proposed decision would leave open the effect to be given to contracts signed before today including renewals of such contracts to a later decision Draft proposed decision issued September 6 2001 not yet acted upon The other information at this time is that the Senate will propose MOU language similar to what originally went over to the assembly in SBX2 78 -a cut-off for paying SCE debt of greater than 20kw probably 100kw and over and no direct access  SCE has previously stated that this is insufficient to allow them to issue bonds thus no creditors could be paid and bankruptcy would follow  CMTA will oppose an MOU bill that proposes a disproportionate spread of the debt without any counterbalancing value to us such as direct access Another piece of this puzzle is the Renewable Portfolio Standard  SB 532 that was attached to the SBX2 78 in order to gain some Democrat support in the Assembly  SB 532 bill got stuck in assembly UC but will come over from the Senate in another bill  CMTA worked to get some improvements in this bill including a procedure that could lower the cost cap from 15 cents and in exchange withdrew opposition  We are NOT in support My guess is that this bill could pass in the Assembly and I wanted to make it better The other business groups have not yet determined their positions I will call Pam with updates to share with you in the next few days

Janel Cc	Shortridge Pat Nersesian Carin edgillespiequinngillespiecom Subject	Hill Meetings on RTOs I had two interesting meetings yesterday afternoon with staff to key members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Rep Richard Burr R-NC and Rep Chip Pickering R-MS  Terry Allen one of our consultants accompanied me In both meetings I used to great effect the broad coalition that had filed with us in the Southeast RTO case against the North Carolina PUC stay request  If you didnt see it -- there is a long article on the coalition and the filing in yesterdays Energy Daily which I used with the staff to show the many groups that support what we need in the Southeast  I am going to send them the filing itself as a follow up Burr is very important because he is the lead cosponor of the Sawyer-Burr bill that has voluntary RTO language and effectively a prohibition on mandatory RTOs  Key points--1	We had heard from a friend of Carins in the Burr office that Burr andor the staff did not have favorable view of Enron  I checked with the head of the Duke office -- a personal friend of mine -- who said the staffer has friends who work for Southern  However at the meeting the staffer said that Burrs office had had difficulties with prior Enron lobbyists no longer with the company and that they looked forward to a fresh start 2	Burrs main interest is transmission legislation that provides incentives for more investment so Wall Street will look favorably on transmission  His main interest is in the incentive pricing section  He said the bill was put in as they left so could stake out an opening position before Barton releases a draft in September  This confirms Pats observation that Burr likes to be a player 3	Staff said Burr has done interviews in which he said that a handful of RTOs are inevitable and desirable -- the question is how to get there  To date he has been most influenced by the NC PUC -- Commissioner Ervin son or grandson of the late Senator is a family friend of the Burr staffer  The PUC says that the FERC RTO plans for the SE would force NC to act on retail competition before 2006 -- which it is not in a position to do  We need to respond to this argument 4	Burr staff acknowledged that the final subcommittee-approved bill if there is one would move far in the direction of the FERC plan  He said that the draft to be sent out from committee staff next week will be a staff draft and that it may not even address the tough issues like RTOs -- leaving those decisions to Members  I will check with Andy Black -- who told me a few weeks ago that it would either affirm FERCs authority or make RTOs mandatory 5	Burr would be very interested in meeting with Ken Lay per the request letter we had faxed earlier yesterday Pickering is important for the added reason that he is the primary House sponsor of PUHCA repeal  His staff confirmed many of the details about process in the House that we had heard elsewhere  The staff draft will be out next week -- may not cover all issues yet  There will be 2-3 hearings in September  That will be followed by a Barton draft that would be formally introduced reflecting additions and changes from the staff draft 1	On PUHCA -- I raised our concerns about the recordkeeping provisions and gave him the clarifying language from VE included in our draft package of language we gave DOE  He said he has spoken to Kelliher whose advice he respects and that Joe said the recordkeeping language needed to be clarified  Joe referred him to the version in HR 2944 in the last Congress which I will check to see if that solves our problem  Staffer is willing to look at our language 2	On RTOs -- Pickerings office has not too much  The staffer is under the impression that Entergy might actually like them in the way FERC has proposed  He said Southern has raised concerns about FERCs plans with Pickerings office but the staffer gets the impression that Southern thinks they are inevitable -- it is all a matter of timing  The disturbing thing is the staffer said something about perhaps staging the RTO process so there would be more of them of smaller scope now on a pre-set path to 4-5 later  I said this was a bad idea -- wasted resources to form the interm steps and likely that the final 4-5 would then never happen  Instead Congress needs to follow FERCs lead that 4-5 make sense based on natural trading markets power flows etc I was encouraged by these meetings in terms of not encountering stiff resistance -- but coming away knowing we need to fully implement our aggressive campaign plans to keep the legislative process from becoming a hindrance to achieving our RTO goals

Consumer Grps Aug 14 2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones  Company Inc This article was originally published Monday NEW YORK -Dow Jones- New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast US The Federal Energy Commission in mid-July directed operators of the power grids in New York New England and the Mid-Atlantic to merge as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the countrys transmission system in independent hands Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect but only at the request of a state regulators according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility and is therefore without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs the groups said in their filing which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization or RTOs with similar market designs transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge the filing said The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England New York and the Mid-Atlantic to meet with utilities generators trade groups state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington DC to Maine The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid at breakneck speed without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging the consumer groups said in their filing Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details Participants have said for example that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard but havent defined what that tariff and standard should be Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks said Anthony Buxton an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Mondays filing All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings Young said Next week they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day according to Young and market participants The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision as evidenced by Chairman Curt Heberts resignation last week and should therefore reconsider its order Buxton said The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast US will run Market participants including consumers will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and wont be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market as they do now Buxton said This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors In that order the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England Buxton said Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what its done Buxton said -By Kristen McNamara Dow Jones Newswires 201-938-2061 kristenmcna mailtokristenmcnamaradowjonescom 713-853-9287 888-703-0309

one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that  amount they are overearning on their stranded costs Jim -----Original Message-----From 	Hoatson Tom Sent	Monday August 13 2001 150 PM To	Steffes James D Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Nicolay Christi L Cc	Montovano Steve Subject	RE Enron ICAP Strawman In response to the issues 1  I would propose that the Reliability Tax modeled after the Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax GRFT and would be an additional line item on a utilitys bill  In this way it is not an increase in either T or D and perhaps the waiver would not be required  See related comment to issue 4 below 2  The proposal contemplates that the generators get the revenue this is their buy-in to the proposal  Taking PJM as the model they currently produce three load forecasts at varying temperatures - one at a high temperature one at a low temperature and one at a designated temperature  The  proposal would set the obligation at the high temperature forecast and the cost-recovery of the ICAP at the low temperature forecast maximizes the MWH charge  Any over-recovery would be used to pay for system improvements  Any under-recovery would be used in setting the recovery charge for the following year  Conceptually this how it is intended to work  However this needs to be thought through in a more detailed level 3  Off hand I dont know what the current ICAP revenues are but I could find out  As for the proposal the tax would be determined by the results of the ICAP auction eg PJM would go out for 60000 MW of ICAP review the bids and set the clearing price  The total cost of ICAP 60000 MW x XMW would be used to set the Tax MWH charge using the low temperature forecast 4  As a separate line item on the utilitys bill and presented as a tax the state regulators would have as much of a role in this tax as they have or had in the GRFT  I see their biggest issue at this early stage of the strawman is what share of over-recovery do the ratepayers receive  The argument that the over-recovery go to system improvements and not to the ratepayers is the efficiency improvement in the system -----Original Message-----From 	Steffes James D Sent	Monday August 06 2001 203 PM To	Hoatson Tom Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Nicolay Christi L Cc	Montovano Steve Subject	RE Enron ICAP Strawman Good start A couple of issues -1	Raising transmission rates for the PA utilities would effectively reduce their Distribution revenues the Settlements stipulated that if T went up then D had to come down  Maybe we could get everyone to agree to a one-time waiver of this and have end-users bills go up 2	Where does the  from the Reliability Tax go  Toward what purpose  If generators are not compensated in some manner maybe a passthrough directly wont they strongly oppose this model  We need to propose some reasonable uses of these funds better metering to enable load curtailment to smaller customers OR maybe pay for an RMR type arrangement 3	What is the current amount of ICAP market revenues today  What would you recommend as a total tax 4	The Reliability Tax would be FERC jurisdicitional as constructed  How are the PUCs going to view this  Will they have a role i setting the  and the use Jim -----Original Message-----From 	Hoatson Tom Sent	Friday August 03 2001 1112 AM To	Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Cc	Montovano Steve Subject	Enron ICAP Strawman In an email I sent yesterday I touched on an ICAP proposal Ive been thinking about and thought I would expand on it more The political reality of ICAP is that it is here to stay at least as long as there are energy price caps or retail rate caps  ICAP is also a most likely outcome by regulators and politicos if energy prices are perceived to be too high assuming no price caps  Therefore we need to come up with a system that is fair and doesnt prejudice any one participant especially if the participant is us  The system I have been kicking around is one in which we would concede any trading opportunity in ICAP but would relieve our load servers with the obligation The ISOs particularly PJM and others have been stating that ICAP is required for reliability reasons  While we can argue against this concept and try to convince these folks that operating reserves with a well-run energy market is sufficient for reliability I dont think we are going to win its a battle of perception and unfortunately one mans perception is another mans reality  For this reason ICAP should be the sole purview of the RTO  The RTO is the one who has all the information on load forecasts and installed resources and is the one who performs the necessary analysis to determine reserve margins and obligations  In PJM the staff  would perform all calculations and present the results to the Reliability Committee for approval which would typically be approved unanimously I would propose that the RTO determine the annual ICAP obligation and then conduct an annual auction for the necessary resources  I know that Enron does not want the RTO involved in the market but this would be no different than what the RTO does in a daily LMP market - he receives bids stacks them determines the clearing price and dispatches according to the stack  It would be the same for the ICAP auction  The RTO would not be a participant in the market as such and is only the facilitator  The total cost of ICAP  would then be allocated to the transmission owners based on a pro-rata share of their installed load and recovered from load as a part of their revenue requirements ideally it would appear as a separate line item on an end users bill and be identified as a reliability tax so they would see what it is costing them This proposal while not perfect would accomplish the following 1  It would satisfy the reliability concerns of the RTOs and politicians 2  It would assess a tax on the load for reliability since load is the beneficiary assuming there is a benefit from ICAP of reliability 3  It would relieve the LSEs of the burden and obligation of providing ICAP 4  Deficiency penalties would not be required and accompanying deficiency rates would not need to be determined 5  Generators would still receive ICAP income provided they are selected in the auction 6  Since the ICAP obligation is typically for a period in the future in PJM the ICAP requirements approved this year are for the year 2003 the much talked about price signal  for new generation is provided 7  It allows the market to set the ICAP and not some artificial deficiency rate 8  Market power issues associated with the existing ICAP markets are eliminated I kept the distribution of this proposal to a limited number to get a feel for this type of proposal  If you are in general agreement with the concept I can formalize it and send it to a larger distribution including the commercial folks  I would of course be interested in any comments or feedback you may have and would incorporate those into the document to be distributed to the larger group  I think a concept of this could be sold to other participants and after we are satisfied with it I would solicit it to others outside of Enron to get their support

track of the dollar flows through  the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR  Once the CPUC decides on the  DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generation-relat ed CTC again  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond 33102 once QF contracts are above the market   SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4 I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC  they will bill it  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 1027 cents ma king it about 1077 cents that collects the 400 million that was

follows20 SCE Recommended Approach20 This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January 1 8 2001 forward  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the gross PX receivable as billed by each utility  which would  be reversed    This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no    generationc ommodity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the 1 cent  will be applicable to Direct Access customers 20 Enron would request the following20 1 Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC20 2 SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an all owable claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p ossible 20 3 PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument20 4 Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit  Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent   level20 5 Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits if when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC20 Other consideration20 Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts 20 PGE Recommended Approach20 This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu ary 18 2001 would include an avoided cost  component  This avoided cost 20 component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDW R purchases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchase s        This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX cle aring price in the old PX formula through March 2002    If the actual CDW R purchase  costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embe dded gen costs  should be included in the calculation 20 20 Enron would request the following20 Same as above20 Other Consideration20 Enron  would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March 2002  This would h amper     Enrons ability         to hedge the positions in the retail port folio20 Hybrid Approach20 This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from Jan uary 18 2001 through September 1 2001 and that the SCE approach is        applicable from September 1st forward   This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa l20 Enron would request the following20 Same as SCE and PGE approach20 Other considerations20 Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts 20 Enron Model20 This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP15 a nd SP15 calculation methodology for the PX credit  20 Enron would request the following20 It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe r PGE and SCE   The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial  is        the probability of getting this approach approved is low   Howev er understanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value    Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti es and CPUC Other considerations20 This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk b ut this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated wit h the     actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting20 Thanks20 Wanda Curry20

for EES I worked very closely with Peter Vint Robert Gresch Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues We worked as a team and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up we all pitched in to resolve the issues Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking I have tried to respect that Prior to sending out the IL analysis I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis and had some questions I did not get a call back Taking the time

imbalance provisions are something we may have agreed to in the settlements which would make us look bad should we file a complaint  Jeff Merola has been working on how we can do physical delivery and how we can address this issue  I know he thinks it is a roadblock but not necessarily an insurmountable one  On the other hand this is another way to focus on the issue of wanting a PJM-type model and perhaps the next step would be to educate ICC Commissioners and Staff on the problem  If we approcah it as a need for a PJM - type model it should not antagonize our efforts of working with ComEd at

Commerce Commission essentially punted on the imbalance issue instead deferring to FERC  Attached is the section from our memo that discussed the imbalance issue  It is my recollection that the issue of establishing subaccounts was not addressed  We will try to confirm this tomorrow As lawyers please do not hesitate to call or email if we can be of any further assistance  Christopher J Townsend  Piper Marbury Rudnick  Wolfe  203 N LaSalle Street  Chicago IL 60601  312 368-4039 direct line  312 630-6300 direct fax  christophertownsendpiperrudnickcom Energy Imbalances 1	Jurisdictional Issues The ARES Coalition Alliant and IIEC argued that the Commission should address energy imbalances in the proceeding  Enron and NewEnergy abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly addressed within Edisons OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition the Commission would not address the propriety of FERCs asserted authority over energy imbalance issues  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at some future time 2	Factual  Policy Issues Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers containing the following provisions 	Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hours imbalances 	For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2 or less or 2 MW or less settlement is made at 100 of out-of-pocket costs OPC regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error 	Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25 of their own individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25 of OPC  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discounts applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount below  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows 	From October 1 1999 through December 31 1999 -- No adder  will apply under this provision 	From January 1 2000 through March 31 2000 -- 25 adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25 of their schedules 20 or more of the hours of the month  If the 20 of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours 	Starting April 1 2000 -- 25 adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25 of their schedules 10 or more of the hours of the month  If the 10 of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours 	Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs  If the hourly imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load excluding PPO load is within the 100 MW bandwidth no RES except those whose imbalance exceeds 25 as noted below will be subject to an adder or discount  PPO load will in aggregate be subject to the same terms and conditions as above but imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadband separately from all RES load 	Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish before applying a charge for energy imbalance  According to Edison this feature will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging overscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the same hour  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100 of Edisons OPC  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the opening of the trading window 	The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be charged an adder or discount of 10  This charge will be allocated among RESs who are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds their individual deadband  The allocation will be based on the ratio-share of the amount by which these individual RESs imbalances exceed their individual deadbands  Any such adderdiscount will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Likewise any adderdiscount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading 	Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with seasonal adjustments  Edison will not require the installation of interval demand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time 	Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth ie no addersdiscounts when the imbalances are due to 1 Edison interruptions and restorations or 2 customer force majeure events that are in each case material to the RESs schedule and of which the RES could not reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule 	Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC The IIEC opposed Edisons proposal and requested that the Commission require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution level  Blackhawk also opposed Edisons proposal and supported the IIEC proposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy imbalance service at the distribution level  Mid-American opposed any effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issue consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for such issues  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in some future FERC proceeding The

the creation of an unregulated monopoly If competition is assumed to develop very rapidly and wholesale market prices are imposed on customers without regulatory intervention and from a market that is not workably com-petitive higher prices and rates that do not meet the statutory standard of just and reasonable are likely On the other hand if a long transition is assumed and significant regulatory control continues to be exercised over prices competition and its benefits could be stifled indefi-nitely In March 2000 the PSC initiated the proceeding to examine the states progress toward competitive markets It sought information on the difficulties that have emerged lessons learned and directions for where to go next The recommended decision says that in a competitive market utilities should play no role in providing electric or gas service But before the PSC removes a utility from the market cer-tain preconditions must be met includ-ing a determination that the wholesale and retail markets are operating without the exercise of market power As a gen-eral matter the utilities should not be removed from any market until multiple suppliers offering a variety of products are available for the entire customer class throughout the utilitys service ter-ritory The PSC also should wait for state lawmakers or the courts to confirm its authority to take such action The recommended decision also says that robust fully competitive retail markets will develop at different times for different customer classes The PSC should encourage invest-ment in transmission and distribution infrastructure for both electricity and gas including if necessary ordering the franchised utilities to construct any need-ed facilities the recommended decision says Although the PSC should restate its support for retail competition and pro-ceed with deliberate speed in fostering market development the agency should maintain just and reasonable rates throughout the period of transition to competition We are confident that a flexible oversight process that encourages com-petition and allows it to develop wherev-er the economics can support it will pro-tect consumers during the transition per-mit markets to develop freely and will serve the public interest the recom-mended decision says Exceptions to the proposed decision are due tomorrow and responses are due Aug 28 The judges and the PSC official plan to present a final recommended decision to the commission this fall JCS

debate at the stakeholders c ommittee That was very positive 2 The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues 20 3 Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m ake the required transition If not alternatives would be pursued example  EISB 4 Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package as a necessary first step  These include 1 Committee Representation  The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent ation and voting to reflect the Task Forces attached Initial Sectors and  Criteria Model This Model is based on the Task Forces preference for rep resentation by sector and incorporates the Task Forces general recognit ion that an RTO sector should be included The Task Force recognizes that s ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th e criteria for belonging but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately Assumi ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode l including the new weighted voting procedures the Task Force recommends  that two ISORTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f or ISOsRTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen ted 2 Committee Participation and Voting  The Task Force recommends open part icipation in each sector subject to certain criteria and qualifications T he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure s used in several Regions ERCOT and MAAC and has incorporated features o f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures  Specifically the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac h sector similar to what is done in MAAC 3 Due Process  The new Organization Standards Process which will be pres ented to the Board in October addresses most due process issues and concer ns The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately 4 One-Stop Shop  The Task Force favors having a single organization for d eveloping Reliability Standards Market Interface Practices and Commercial Practices The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven t itself to become this organization and should take definitive steps in t hat direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings 5 Funding  The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils The Fun ding Task Group recommendations adopted by the Board in February 2001 sho uld be pursued 6 MIC Role in Standards Approval  The Task Force recommends as an immedi ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce ss and to provide a bridge until the new Organization Standards process  is implemented requiring the MIC to vote on all newproposed NERC Operatin g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board includin g consideration of any minority positions 5 Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a po ssible alternative 6 Silence on the issue of self regulating organization  No one advocati ng that position 7 Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner Jose20 From09Charles YeungENRONenronXgate on 10152001 0601 PM To09mbennettepsaorgSMTPenronXgate

some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco uver this Monday The customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting   Reps from Enron Mirant Dynegy DENA APPA and ELCON were present All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side  This may mean putting aside some internal positions  Cust omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o rganization for both reliability and commercial issues The Goulding Task F orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action Agenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues To ensure unity in appearance customers agreed to maintain discussions in  front of the Independents at a higher policy level   Many details are need ed to get individual entities on board however such details should not i mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles i e-one-stop-shop balance of membership etc  Therefore all agreed to kee p details out of the discussion ie-funding seats charter etc The actual SHC discussion was constructive and persons articulated the nee d for a package deal to the room The debate brough the expected concerns o f the transmission providers to the surface  TVA Terry Boston was most v ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side   Dominion Resources G lenn Ross supported the customers position  PJM Phil Harris was also su pportive 20 Agenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC  does not have the authourity to require corporate independence Suggestions made to perform better and more audits  Dave Penn brought up the memo fro m Roy Thilly  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu tion  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c ompetitive market structure  FRCC Wiley made arguments that the NERC sho uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples  Should deal directly and specifically with the problem20 A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions 1 NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it 2 NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci fic actions to safeguard independent judgement audits The vote was 2124  There were strong comments that this vote was not inte nded to be an industry representative vote only to show how split the indu stry is over this

and in some cases  exceeding - PJM Reserve payments compensate only those units that are not operating at the  time but have the capability of generating in less than 10 minutes The cos t for these reserves is not easily calculated due to lack of a transparent  market Yet they appear to be approximately less than 2MW-day during on-p eak periods and often less than 1MW-day This would result in costs of le ss than 115MW-day based on the Allegheny Power peak load The cost for a typical residential customer would be 012 cents per kWh The Current PJM Model The PJM model could similarly be described as pay for everything and stil l pay extra for what you need Generators receive three payments the rese rve payments mentioned above a capacity payment and an energy payment PJ M like ECAR has a need for operating reserves and purchases these in orde r to maintain reliability Additionally the PJM model provides an Unforced Capacity payment to all generators based on their historical performance  Generators receive this payment whether or not they are able to operate on  a particular day or are already being compensated for providing electricity  PJM currently compensates generators based on a 19 percent reserve margin  The overall cost of ICAP has varied considerably over the three years of  competition The average since 1999 has been 7874MW-day This results in overall costs of over 16 billion per year Residential customers have ex perienced ICAP costs ranging from about 04 to 18 cents per kWh Moreover on top of ICAP a PJM customer must purchase additional spinning reserves  costing approximately the same as the reserves in ECAR Ending the Rip-off PJM should move to a reserve-based reliability methodology similar to ECAR An Operating Reserve-based methodology used in tandem with PJMs competiti ve electricity market will furnish the same level of reliability but at gre atly reduced prices This methodology should pay for those products that ar e really needed - excess reserves to be used during peak demand periods A  strong forward energy and operating reserve market can send the right price signals to build new generation - a fact that is readily apparent as we lo ok to the Mid-west where thousands of megawatts of new generation have been built in response to clear price signals over the past few years All this tells us that ICAP has its self-interested defenders but no justif ication for raiding consumers wallets ---------------------------------E-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Auth ors are available for print or broadcast PennFuture wwwpennfutureorg with offices in Harrisburg Philadelphia a nd Pittsburgh is a statewide public interest membership organization whic h advances policies to protect and improve the states environment and econ omy PennFutures activities include litigating cases before regulatory bod ies and in local state and federal courts advocating and advancing legisl ative action on a state and federal level public education and assisting c itizens in public advocacy To unsubscribe simply reply to this email with unsubscribe in the subjec t -

swirling around  There is legislation pending right now as I write this e-mail  The outcome is uncertain  But here is what I know and what I have been working on for BOMA First the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September 6th including any DA contract signed since last January  The PUC has threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending action on the issue by the legislature  Even if the PUC were to act the legislature could override their action with a statute  But I anticipate that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September 14th The real action is in the legislature  There is a comprehensive bill -- SB 78XX the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen the Governor and the Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison  Here are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it 1 The state would securitize 29 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its debts  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or more in peak daily demand  That would translate to about 006 as in 6100ths of a penny per kW  The original proposal was to place the bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand which would have been maybe 15 cents per kW since the base would have been much smaller but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW 2 The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable  That means that Edison customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or from a DA contractor  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying 3 The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand load which exceeds supply as calculated as follows DWR contracts  IOU retained generation  IOU long term contracts  If this delta or headroom exists as of 1103 then per PUC regswhich are yet to be devloped the Calif Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount of headroom without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee  An exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a customer for the customers proportional share of the states stranded costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR but for which there is no market  If no headroom exists a customer still could go DA but pay the exit fee to do so 4 A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to 11701 to continue without penalty  It looks like contracts signed between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty but that date is not definite  Contracts signed between June and August 24th would also be permitted but may have to pay some sort of retroactive exit fee on a sliding scale depending on the date they were signed  All DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1103 schedule described in 3 above In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers and exit fees for DA customers when no headroom exists there will be another surcharge for all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since January 17th  That surcharge would be to payoff 13 billiion in state revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR bought since January Where does BOMA and the rest of the business community stand on these issues 1 BOMA has been OK with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan 17 when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market power 2 While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR long term contracts we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for them and wants to be held harmless for their costs  BOMA and other business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without exit fees 3 BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any surplus electricity revenues after the first 500 million to ratepayers based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate payments  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50 in the last few months 4 Finally BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison  But the Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone he can see including all business groups to help get it enacted  In that light BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers residential as well as business pay the debt  The legislature however did not want to pass this cost on to residential customers so then it became a fight over where the consumer threshold would be  As stated above we have suceeded in getting it as low as 20kW peak demand  NOTE  There are those that feel it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to get the state out of the energy business  You can decide for yourselves 5 It should also be noted that the Edison bond and DWR surcharges may all be covered in the existing rates you are now paying  That is to say that there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since the market price for power has come down substantially  But this remains to be seen There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes  The committee is going back in at 630 this evening and we will see what happens  I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation Les Spahnn                                                          The information contained in this communication may be confidential is intended only for the use of the

Geriann Watanabe Mika W ood Doug Yeung Charles Yoho Lisa Subject09Government Affairs Organization Announcement With the announcement of Enrons acquisition by Dynegy behind us and with  the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future  Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had  that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also  very decent and good people  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is  not easy  I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we  shared  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special  Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to  me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our  ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times  The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all  US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective  As a result  Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of  the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows  Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will  be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner   La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial  development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support  Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same  Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda  taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC  Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function  Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the non-energy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband  Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada  Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts  will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs  to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company  That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord  Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself  We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes  myself  Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of  Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future  However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through  this uncertain and troubled period for the company  We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to

PennFuture Subject	PennFutures E-Cubed - Straight to the Source PennFutures E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market ---------------------------------September 26 2001 Vol 3 No 18 Straight to the Source Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news Importantly the merger settlement provided 32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania This year the companys wholesale trading and marketing unit Power Team presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement and are not included in the 32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms two of which will be operational next month The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week Mike Freeman the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible gave us some insight into Exelons renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into Americas power grids ---------------------------------Whats in Power Teams renewable portfolio We have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage 150 MW of wind 100 MW of landfill methane 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste 20 MW of wood waste and 16 MW of scrap tires All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as new resources All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e but only 10 MW is new generation Of the hydro all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e but the biomass plant is Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio There were two principal reasons a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel emissions and cost Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business I dont think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases Part of the hands-off approach was due to I believe a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation not changing the power system in any way Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system For me thats the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable and that demand for these products could be sustaining Will this encourage new development Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location but is also willing to talk about additional new projects Over time other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same If this chain of events occurs I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter just like other energy products now How do renewables fit into Power Teams overall business strategy We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy More specifically we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards but also because of natural demand The average person may not think of it this way but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements Why Wind Theres no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998 and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand including supply-side and demand-side solutions We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal The first is probably the need for a long-term contract Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period We dont have a problem with long-term deals per se although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well We dont want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else In my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length In fact our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built Beyond the long-term contract the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating Exelon Generation is rated A- by SP so we are a natural counter-party for project financing Right now there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have Will that always will be the case No If were right about long-lasting demand I think other large companies including distribution companies will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects Weve teamed up with a retail marketer Community Energy to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it In the development of conventional generation it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built For example a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods And in some cases the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing Is there a financial advantage for wind If ones view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project outside of significant advances in technology Over a long period of time 15 or 20 years I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio With conventional generation and firm transmission paths a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets whether they are hourly daily monthly or longer Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing amount and ultimate sink of expected output The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100 of the time as possible so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesnt match scheduled energy The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio Were one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix How does intermittent generation add complexity A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency even for an experienced organization like ours because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind You dont have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand In PJM where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis and receive or pay market-clearing prices depending on actual generation wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties An obstacle and were working with PJM on this right now is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity For purposes of regulating the system PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand This will not be practical with wind generation Wed literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do In the must-run scenario wed still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators Either way wed have to predict output which is a dicey proposition Does that make wind generation unreliable Not at all Weve got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time such as a full year Those predictions underlie our contracts But its another thing to tell the wind when to blow The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what Ive described In PJM a 54000 MW system this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as negative load instead of generation Which is to say when the plant is generating electricity the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating When the plant is not generating the load will increase A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve In this unique circumstance which of the ancillary services apply to negative load and at what level Were working with PJM on these questions Im uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way Other countries and the western US transmission systems have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation and so can we Are you working on other approaches Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market to a control area that does have such a market The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment However notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach Will PJM resolve these problems Yes PJM is progressive and innovative and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the schedulingimbalance issue Its hard now because were breaking new ground I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed How big might your renewable portfolio get Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy well continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy Id like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market such as PJM to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on If we execute a contract successfully wed like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp and National Wind Power What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage Perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy ---------------------------------E-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications Authors are available

Steve 20 Sent09Monday August 20 2001 911 AM To09Steffes James D Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc09Perrino Dave Subject09RE Transmission Divesture and Tax Policy Response to your questions 1  I think it would be best if it there were transmission assets only  Gi ven the geographic scale we want to achieve adding in the distributions sy stems is unnecessary and my lead to more perpetuation of the local mentalit y  I dont think you get much of a scale benefit from adding in the distri bution systems  The distribution systems are also likely to remain as supp liers of last resort in the event of retail access which raises complicati ons  It would be equivalent to an pipeline also being an LDC 20 2  The divesting company does not get the shares its shareholders receive them as a direct distribution  As a result the old management has no con trol over the shares of the Transco  Several utilities UtilA UtilB Util C etc agree to simultaneously spin off their transmission into BigTrans  The share holders of UtilA get X shares of BigTrans in exchange for Y shar es of UtilA and how hold Y fewer shares in UtilA and X shares of BigTrans  The spin off could also be done as part of a merger  Both parties agree t o spin off their transmission into a common company  The shareholders woul d receive publicly traded hares in both UtilA-BCombine and BigTrans  The m anagements of both companies being separated from each other  There would  have to be a conflict of interest standard for the board and management of  BigTrans which prohibits any substantial benefit from market

following describes the suggestion that I made in our meeting this m orning  This is a strategy which could only be executed in legislation  20 The Problem One of the chief difficulties of forming a Transco are the tax consequences of divestiture of assets The problem was identified in 1995 when we first started talking about a Transco in the West   If the parties agree in adv ance of divesture to combine their assets with others into a new company t he divestiture creates a tax event  As a result the Transcos like Allian ce or TransConnect have adopted an LLC structure to avoid the tax consequen ces of formation  The problem with the LLC form is the reluctance of the o wners to surrender all control of their assets to the Managing Member who h as little skin in the game  Questions have also been raised by opponents about the fiduciary responsibilities of Managing Member  Are they to look out of the financial interests of the owners passive and active  All th ese issues came up when we were working with various companies in 1999-2000 on possible pipewire companies The Suggestion Create a short window during which utilities could divest their assets into a Transco without facing a tax penalty  Under such a provision current o wners would be allowed to agree in advance to combine their assets to form  a new company without taxes being levied on the spin off as long as the ne w company was a transmission only company  The shareholders of the contrib uting companies would received publicly traded shares in the new company s o there is no issue of the original company controlling the Transco  The F ederal Treasury is tax neutral since without the provision the Transco doe snt form  When the shareholders of Transco sell their shares the are tax able if the Transco becomes more valuable then the benefit accrues to Tre asury in taxes on the sale of the stock  With a two year window the compa nies would be faced with a one time opportunity to make the shift and avoid taxes  This become a trigger for breaking up the vertical integration for which a business case can be made the shareholders of todays owners are b etter off 09Thanks for listening reading Steve

but rather the scheduling advantages that the IA functions provide for must be available to every market partic ipant  Today the entities that operate a control area are advantaged by the capabilities NERC rules provide under the Interchange Authority  Unde r a contract path transmission model control areas do not have to keep day -ahead balanced schedules and can play in the energy market with unbalanc ed portfolios up until the schedule ramping times  Non-control areas can o nly get transactions approved for scheduling under specific source and sink requirements that forces them to submit balanced interchange schedules  T his is a major reason why competitive generators have sought to become NERC certified control areas  The CACTF model allows for the scheduling functi ons required of an IA to be disaggregated from the other control area fun ctions without detriment to reliability - thus levelizing the playing field for all competitive PSEs To levelize the playing field Enron supports 2 issues 1 Consolidation of control areas - to provide independence to eliminate th e market advantages20 2 Elimination of day ahead balanced schedules requirements -

with you and your staff over the past six months I truly expanded my understanding of the scope and challenges of government affairs work since our initial meeting about a year ago In particular I appreciate more the important internal role that GA plays in supporting other units at Enron the academics tend to focus more on external actions in the public policy arena I hope that I was able to contribute to the projects that I was assigned The GA Assessment more below was particularly interesting and clearly is important for decision making about GA activities I also enjoyed assisting GAs work with EIMs steel traders Please give my thanks to your employees with whom I worked My overall assessment is that they work extremely hard and are dedicated to solving Enrons GA-related problems I thank Maureen and Ginger for taking care of the logistical details and making me feel part of the GA team I also thank Gus Earleen and the other support staff Finally I want to recognize Lisa Yoho I really enjoyed working with her and feel shes an important contributor to the GA team If you need anything from Rice please do not hesitate to contact me I hope that we continue to keep in touch Cordially Doug Schuler also sent by attachment To     Steve Kean Rick Shapiro Jim Steffes From   Doug Schuler Rice University schulerriceedu 713 348-5472 Re     Government Affairs Assessment Process A Brief Analysis Date   August 2 2001 This brief analysis is based upon my assignment with Amr Ibrahim and Elizabeth Linnell to review the Accomplishments for the Period November 2000 to April 2001 reports filed by the GA professional staff It is also based upon some of the academic literature on valuation of business activities where we are interested not only on the costs side in a traditional cost center approach but also the benefits moving towards a profit center approach The importance of considering benefits is that it allows the senior GA managers to assign professional staff to areas reflecting their highest benefit considering the opportunity costs of that assignment Additionally it should allow senior GA managers to articulate more clearly GA needs eg budget requests personnel to internal constituents at Enron What I saw Data were collected from about 60 GA professionals in the Accomplishment Report for the period November 2001 to April 2001 Each individual was asked to list his or her accomplishments the unit it served the area eg deal support origination etc its value and the methodology used Regarding the accomplishments done during the period about 25 involved activities aimed at other Enron units such as improving communications between GAPA and ENA and EES in the New York market developing a GA website with EBS and working with EIM to design a risk management program for a client About 75 of activities were externally oriented although in support of internal Enron customers primarily towards regulatory and legislative bodies at various levels of government Very few individuals provided data for value and methodology Probably less than 20 of the activities were valued and the methods used varied widely For these relatively few entries GA professionals claimed a contribution of 643 billion a figure that appears to be highly overstated My analysis would be despite the considerable efforts that went into compiling and completing these reports that senior GA management has not gained significant insights as to the value of these activities or as to an accurate methodology to calculate such values What is needed If our goal is the identity and measurement of GA activities it is crucial that these be tied to the broad strategies of Enron Otherwise we run the risk of creating a system that desires A but rewards B Thus the first step needs to be the identification of the most important broad strategies of GA The Government AffairsPR Communications report appears to be a first step it identified such strategies as 1 business unit support 2 create open markets and other business opportunities and 3 regulatory and governmental risk identification and mitigation For each of these strategies some primary objectives need to be articulated For example for business unit support some objectives might be 1 information provision timeliness and accuracy 2 transaction support 3 new market development and 4 asset protection note these are just my off the cuff objectives Then we need to look a ways to assess the attainment of each of these objectives For example with information provision we might go to our users in other units of Enron to see how they would rate perhaps on a 1-5 scale such things as timeliness accuracy criticality for their transaction etc We might also count the number of projects meetings memos etc that GA produced with information for other units We would do likewise for the other objectives Note that the Balanced Scorecard Approach BSA may be used to make such linkages and measures The BSA is a strategy implementation tool where activities are measured and compared to the goals of the firm BSA gives guidelines on the types of measures that are appropriate it considers such things as leading and lagging indicators training would be a leading indicator as it occurs before the activity profits on a trade would be a lagging indicator as it is the result of various activities and financial and non-financial measures The goallike oursis to try to take into account enough measures of the activity to make a satisfactory judgment of its merits I believe if you could create such a system you would have a much better idea of how to deploy your employees across projects how much to charge other units for GA services and when to outsource GA activities In order to do what I have suggested I think that you will have to devote more resources One possibility is to assemble a small team with members from GA and one or two operating units eg a director from EES who has some GA interaction to create this systematic approach to GA evaluations You also might consider adding an outsider to this process Finally I am amenable to discussing a role for me in the process I plan to continue to work on this valuation framework in an academic way eg for scholarly journals with Marc Epstein one of my colleagues in accounting who has done much with the balanced scorecard approach Once we have developed a clearer framework we would like to create a practitioner version that might be useful for your GA analysis Doug Schuler Associate Professor of Management Rice University Jesse

IURC C Janine Below is a short response I have drafted if we choose to respond although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary to these emails  Im a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails  I think our best response to Ron Cinergy is that MISO does not serve load so MISO is not accountable to IURC  Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility  If we agree with that statement are they subject to any IURC oversight  Even if they are I dont think it should be because of the bundled retail load issue but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all public utilities perhaps for safety reasons within its state  But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility then we may need to revise the statement below I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any bundled retail load in Indiana once MISO is operating  In a prior order FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff  If this is the case one could argue that the service is no longer bundled but I dont think we want to get into that argument with these guys Here is some language that I put together  What does everyone else think The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region  MISO will not serve retail load nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers  Therefore we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers  They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers  It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC not MISO -----Original Message-----From 	Steffes James D Sent	Friday November 09 2001 1028 AM To	Migden Janine Roan Michael Stroup Kerry Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Subject	RE FW Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners Proposed Settlement Agreement -

IURC C Ron It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval but it also seems to me that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to an RTO which does have FERC approval  In other words come December 15 or January 1 or January 15 we could have Indiana utilities still being operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are today  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition If my proposition is correct then the issue becomes whether the proposed transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83 ie a public interest standard As you know I think that MISO has done a creditable although by no means perfect job in considering and balancing the interests of affected parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process     So I think that it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and load up the IURC approval process with a lot of party-specific Christmas tree ornaments By the same token I am quite concerned about a rubber stamp approach to IURC review  I think that the state-level parties and the IURC have a significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not exceed five  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects of MISO operation on Indiana retail load  I think that the state-level parties and the IURC have an interest in defining the goals or standards for MISO performance during the initial transfer period based on which an extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied  I think that the state-level parties and the IURC have an interest in the MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of accountability re at least bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission and the Indiana parties   And I do not see those interests being recognized or accommodated very much if at all in your settlement proposal  Do you disagree  If so tell me how you see those interests addressed in your proposal I want to hear what others say but as matters stand my inclination would be to pursue these issues in the hearing brief them and then let the Commission decide  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC decisional process enough to make a difference If so how much delay with what effect Thanks Mike Michael A Mullett Mullett  Associates 309 West Washington Street Suite 233 Indianapolis IN 46204 Phone 317 636-5165 Fax  317 636-5435 E-mail  mullettcacaolcom

Communication Meeting As indicated by this ex parte notice Edison is planning to meet with Bilas this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access  Edisons comments on the proposed decision say that over 6 of their load has switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame resulting in a total of over 7 of load being served by direct access over their entire system at present  While it appears Bilas is still a strong proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options should Enron or AReM get in to see Bilas and possibly Brown to try to prevent any backsliding on the 13th  We have a right to a
