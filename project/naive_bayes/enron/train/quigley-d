Ill throw my two cents in  Dutch is right Ricky is right     Ernie is right as is Kevin and everyone else who responded  We are     an extremely fortunate bunch  We tend to be extraordinarily resilient     and forgiving  I took a bunch of flak over the past three years for     my frequent absences however they were not absences because of a     flippant attitude  Law school took its toll as did accommodating Jos     set of friends  My time had to be split many ways and it can be     difficult to juggle everything as I am sure you are all aware  But     mind you I was not absent because I didnt care or found something     better to do  It was never because I didnt want to  At the risk of     this becoming even more of a love in you guys should know as this is     apparently the only opportunity weve taken you are my friends  And     I would like to keep it that way  I have to go now  Mark says that     that the keyboard placement blocks his access to my balls

friendly humor 2	Everyone is pissed bc they drove 100 miles  they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to play they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole  finish the

do you guys even think before you type I am a CFO and an accountant and I cant decipher what you are trying to confirm here From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers One upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare they couldnt rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm  This was a captive client who and needs to trade who will not show us their flow again The latest is the most disturbing we just want to do a small trade to test your system We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details not one phone call to confirm the tradenothing  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently Well clearly we failed We do not understand what is going on in the back office  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business  Is there too much turnover How are they trained  Who is in charge of the backoffice  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process who co-ordinates all their efforts  Does anyone care  Ok Ill stop For our part we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her We have to stop this before we lose clients which we will All the problems are being caused by the following 1 Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients  This has already cost us money this year Our clients do 10 trades a day they are constantly in and out of positions it is imperative that we get these right  As well this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system There are hundreds of books at Enron  We have postions on with dozens of them  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot  We have to select books one by one this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow Michelle is in charge of this process  We need a IT person on this yesterday  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates  Robyn Russell and I check it everyday there are always mistakes 2 There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them  There is no check after they have been imput  There are ALWAYS imput errors  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admins starts for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish 2a Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered what if deals are imput incorrectly the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client  Going forward confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct 2b Invoicing there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done 3 EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here we have signed Renaissance up a 10B program fund but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks 4 Credit- All of our clients are margined  If deals are in the system incorrectly the wrong MTM goes to the client another mis-match  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through again we are doing this now

Subject	Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning  Here are my notes  Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements  Watson spoke for c 10 minutes Bergstrom for 5 and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred  If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be 45 Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true  Dynegy owed Enron 50MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps 30MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the off-balance-sheet structures including the credit-linked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible  However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its 364-day facility believe this is the 3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next 6-8 weeks BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office  trading books will need to be combined at closing  EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there  The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded non-core assets  Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT 100 sure that no surprises remain in Enrons books--but that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses  Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops 35Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at 090-095 which represents a 25 haircut to Enron internal estimates  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively short-term in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5 discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices  ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better  No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker

do you guys even think before you type I am a CFO and an accountant and I cant decipher what you are trying to confirm here From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers One upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare they couldnt rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm  This was a captive client who and needs to trade who will not show us their flow again The latest is the most disturbing we just want to do a small trade to test your system We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details not one phone call to confirm the tradenothing  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently Well clearly we failed We do not understand what is going on in the back office  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business  Is there too much turnover How are they trained  Who is in charge of the backoffice  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process who co-ordinates all their efforts  Does anyone care  Ok Ill stop For our part we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her We have to stop this before we lose clients which we will All the problems are being caused by the following 1 Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients  This has already cost us money this year Our clients do 10 trades a day they are constantly in and out of positions it is imperative that we get these right  As well this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system There are hundreds of books at Enron  We have postions on with dozens of them  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot  We have to select books one by one this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow Michelle is in charge of this process  We need a IT person on this yesterday  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates  Robyn Russell and I check it everyday there are always mistakes 2 There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them  There is no check after they have been imput  There are ALWAYS imput errors  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admins starts for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish 2a Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered what if deals are imput incorrectly the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client  Going forward confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct 2b Invoicing there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done 3 EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here we have signed Renaissance up a 10B program fund but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks 4 Credit- All of our clients are margined  If deals are in the system incorrectly the wrong MTM goes to the client another mis-match  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through again we are doing this now

Sent09Wednesday October 31 2001 1154 AM To09Quigley Dutch Subject09Reduction of trading lines by Fimat Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run Johns book an d may see something in this situation I do not I wondered if you could giv e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner  Thanks Sarah09 On Tuesday Oct 30 Warren Tashnek Fimat Houston and Steve Forman Fimat  NY telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from 20 million to 11 million for Enron  This cut is irrespective of the 20 mil lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line  Soc Gen is th e bank that owns Fimat brokerage  Fimat made this decision based on the f ollowing events according to Steve Thursday 1025 ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat  The positions came from exi sting positions at ABN JP Morgan SSB and Goldman Sachs  Generally broker s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as sociated with the moving of the trades20 Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat  In this case Fimat agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook  them at the trade price  There was a 10 million variation margin associat ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send on Friday to Fimat  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade  price Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the 10 million on Friday  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for  10 million in variation margin on Thursday night   20 Friday 1026 On Friday Fimat did not receive its 10 million from ABN as agreed  When  Fimat called ABN ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to  send the money directly to ENE  This left Fimat exposed for 10 million on behalf of Enron 20 On Friday morning Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed 28  million by Fimat  Fimat sent 57 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G en margin line for Enron  This left 22 million available for ENE but Fima t wanted its 10 million  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat 20 On Friday there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal  F imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE  The numbe r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer e undisclosed 20 Very late on Friday HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada 20 Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r ight now Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer 20 Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron  Fimat is uncomfortable with these events 20 Monday 1029 Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron  Fimat wants to reassess  the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer red to them and also the positions transferred  Fimat informed Enron that  it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone  Fimat would n ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later  in the day  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by 800 am as to what cash transfers will occur  Under our current loan agre ement with Soc Gen Fimat informs Soc Gen by 1200 noon if money should mov e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di scomfort with ENE as a counter party 20 Tuesday 1030 100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN Fimat proposed solutions 3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE although ENE has alrea dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen ts on ENEs behalf My tkae on the situation Fimat is upset based mainly on Enrons handling of expitted trades and bad  press  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m argin lines to ENE  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was responsible for Fimats inconveniences   I explained that Enron is prepar ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak e payments to Fimat on our behalf  That issue should have been resolved wh en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi ne so far  As far as the confusion with ABN we were not party to the disc ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that    Fin ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no tice time  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on  an on going basis  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea rly in the morning like all the other brokers 20 We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now  I am not inclined t o
