Chris,

I have set up a tentative conference call with John cogan for 10 a.m. CDT/8 a.m. PDT tomarrow.  Is this time good for you?  If not, please let me know what time is good for you.  I think John is pretty flexible as he is hanging out in New Orleans.

thanks,

Stacy,

Where are we with the Mesa document?  They are extremely concerned - they must go through an act of congress to get anything signed.

Suz,

I say lets do it! and so does Terri.  I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.  I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!  Keep me posted on how your day is going.  I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Terri,

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the
TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit -
but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -
thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim

Or did you just sail around since you lived down there?  I've gotten my pictures back but I am waiting to see pictures from the other people that went.  I was using diposable cameras since mine was broken.  I was so disappointed that I went out and bought a new one the minute I got back!

I left Thursday for a wedding in Green Bay, and then Sunday the bride and groom and a bunch of others, went up to the bride's family cabin up in Northern Wisconsin.  It was great.  We canoed, fished, drank a lot of beer and listened to awesome guitarists jam around the campfire.    Got back at 11:30 last night.

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you will be unable to attend. Thanks.

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to
admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never
able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the
invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that
would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.
I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you
could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Mark,

I used the swap model to determine the present value of what the origination would have been.  I came up with $130,188.  Let me know if you need more details.

Thanks,

kim

That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

K.

ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!

BTW, Tom drove from 12th to 6th in his race.   Very impressive.  Also, Kramer told me yesterday that the SCCA tow fund is paying us $600 each.  Yeah!  It goes to the top 3 guys that go and there were only 3 guys from our region!  Also, did you know Jimmy won close to 10k for getting 2nd?  Spicer (winner) got something like 13k in cash and trinkets.

Cool!

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Ellen,

Palo Alto is telling me that they need Enron signatures on all of the confirms that we sent them last week.  If you could print out copies and have them sent to me, I can get Barry to sign them and overnight them to Palo.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris,

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

Kim Ward

Jeff,

Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January, 2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you need -

Thanks,

Kim

Hey Lyndon!  Very glad to finally hear from you.  Sounds like you are happy=
 back in Austrailia!  I would love to see it sometime.  Unless things chang=
e between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on Janu=
ary 6th.  We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. Ma=
rtin look fabulous.  We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before w=
e get on the boat.  I hope you are there.  Although I would understand if y=
ou stayed where you are!  Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay i=
n Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.

As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really clo=
se to me was killed.  I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night, just =
in time not to get stuck there.  One of my very good friends was suppose to=
 be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was ca=
lled back to Houston for a meeting tuesday.  Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 =
am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had=
 that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him=
.  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is ve=
ry sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are=
 doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make =
me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that th=
is thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most =
things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freed=
om were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in=
 and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be d=
one to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away =
to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that a=
ttitude! =20

Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing th=
e same - just here in ugly Houston for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba =
for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of=
 the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go=
 back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!

Take care,

Love, K2

To my lovely K2,

Sorry I haven't written in a while but life has been
passing by so fast that I rarely know what day it is.
I hope that you and any friends or family were not
hurt in any of the attacks on the USA. It's just
unbelievable that someone could hold so much hatred
for others that they would do these things. It's
beyond my realm of understanding.
I hope life is treating you well and you are safe.
As for me I am back a home and trying to decide
whether or not to leave and go back to work. I am
supposed to go back to the poly on the 7th Oct but
don't really want to leave home. It's so beautiful
here, and I am a little worried about the next war
that is going to happen. Worried for all hatred and
sadness that it is going to cause. Its really got me
thinking about living more in the present rather than
planning ahead, not that I have had much forethought
to begin with but something to think about.
I have some photos for you that should be attached to
this email.
Again I hope you are well and still loving this life.

Take Care

Love Lyndon

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Hey Kim!! I wish I could join you guys in January too!!! I definitely would
if I wasn't going in December!! I've had trouble adjusting to the "real

send you a new invitation. I just need to know which e-mail address you want
me to send it to. Just let me know and I'll send it right out!! Take care

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to
admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never
able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the
invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that
would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.
I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you
could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Kim 2

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet describing our proposal for September.  The changes are highlighted in yellow.  One of the things you guys might be interested in looking at long term is extending the current fixed price deals that you have and blending the price.  Another is a peaking option or cap.  We can talk about these things on the phone.
Give me a call when you have a chance to review the term sheet and let me know what you guys want to do.

Thanks,

Kim

I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.  Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  Don't know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?  I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.  Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?  or just my drinking goggles?

I have revised the spreadsheet I have been sending you with the fixed prices for the citizens deal.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to see additional enhancements.  As deals are done, I will continue to update this spreadsheet.

Houston has actually been nice - hasn't gone above 85 and it is great to sit outside at night.  Anyway, you work too much and need to think about getting a life!!  

We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.

I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  

Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!

Take care,

Kim

This Friday, May 11, I have four new brokers coming over from the

with them. Honestly, I'd rather be sweating in Houston and be at your party.

Did you make it to Greasewood Flats?

Art,

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Steve,

Attached is a little presentation detailing our proposal for some El Paso capacity that I previously mentioned to you.  Once you have a chance to look it over, give me a call and we can discuss your interests, what would make the proposal more attractive for Santa Clara, and any questions that you might have.

Also,  did you receive my indications for the products you were interested in?

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan, and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about $.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.  The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the people gate code is c1984.  

See you then -

Kim

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Chino plant 100% down = 80 MW
Bagdad plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw
Cerrito plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw

Basically 120 -150 MW offline due to PDs decrease in producion.  the same percentage decrease in gas demand is what we should see.  Let me know if you would like us to investigate this further.

Thanks,

Kim

Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches! 

Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.  I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Dan,

Most things here look good.  From my term sheet, page 1 under El Paso Capacity, what about selling them San Juan gas?  (B.)  And what about page three, number 8?  Let me know -

thanks,

Kim

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about.  The market it down today so they may appear to be a little high.  I am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed.  Please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs.

I would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together.  In order to do so, we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an ISDA master swap agreement in place.  One thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be in touch with the transport structure.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!

Thanks, 

Kim

Kim -

I have spoken to Stacy Dickson about what needs to happen with the whole "Australian parent/US subsidiary" guaranty issue.  I haven't heard back yet.

Attached is the BHP Copper master physical.  It's in PDF format, so they'll need Adobe Acrobat to view.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Scotty,

Long time - no email.  How are you?  As you know, things aren't so good here.  It is so sad!!!  Anyway, just wanted to put another bug in your ear - I'm still pro Atlanta.  If you know of anything going on at Mirant that would be a fit for me - please let me know.  West gas or power, origination or trading.  Give me a call sometime - I don't know how long I will be at this desk but my number here is 713-853-0685.  My cell is 713-412-4571.  That shouldn't change.  My email address at home is kward1@houston.rr.com.

I do hope all is well with you - and that you keep in touch no matter what!

Take care,

Kim

I have not talked to Sarabeth as you have the only copy of the invoice that I had.  Have you talked to Bryce about that invoice?  What do you guys need in order to pay them?

Sara,

Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have
attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan,
and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are
pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru
March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about
$.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.
The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell
significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you
the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some
reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim

Chris, 

If you have a minute, will you look at this term sheet?  His volumes are really small but if we get the Palo Alto deal it won't be that big of a deal - unless we have to schedule less than 1 MMBtu. Oh yo!  His average daily volume, for both plants is about 178/day, based on annual usage.  I have proposed basically a GD deal with a first of the month index option if he can set a BDQ.

Thanks in advance.

Kim

Kelli,

While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.

I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.

thanks,
Kim

Hey Lyndon,

It was nice to hear from you.  We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!  Things here have been changing by the day.  To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that Kim 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!

How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -

Kim

Life has been very busy back here on the poly. We have
just come out of wetdock and the ship is a mess but
will be awesome by the time you get here. Our first
cruise this week is a gay cruise, very strange!!!!!
Its not really my type of cruise. Seeing 2 guys
cuddling each other sleeping on the deck is a bit much
for me. I dont dislike it, its just I dont understand
it. Women are such beautiful creatures, why !!!
Anyway yes I will more than likely be here when you
get here, unless I get sacked or quit, but more than
likely I will be here.

Take Care
See you soon
Love Lyndon

I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.  

I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac!

Kim, 

How's the hiring climate over in Barry's world?  The future here in broadband obviously is bleak.  I'm trying to generate job leads at a company that is quickly shrinking.  Not an enviable position.  

Attached is a resume.  Any inquiries on my behalf are appreciated. As for added comments to hiring people: although I've spent my entire 2 1/2 year Enron career at EBS, I've been in trading, structuring, and origination roles the entire time. I can model and sell w/ the best of them.  I also know Jean Mrha and Tom Gros well. (If that's worth anything.)

Any help is much appreciated. 

Thanks

-Rob

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and

FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk.

I know you cannot control this.  If we can say anything to give our side of the story, we should.  Grigsby should know that the customer is a little pissed.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

It is once again about to be our Nations' bday and we can't think of any be=

lipe Jens will be cooking up some authentic Brazilian bar-b-q and we plan o=
n transferring the crowd to the top of the Rice Village Garage to put down =
some more beers and watch fireworks from downtown, Astroworld and everywher=
e else.  After that, anything can happen.

Come on over anytime after 5pm.  Bring friends, family and beer if you like=
, as well as beach chairs, footballs and frisbees (rooftop fun).  Kids are =
welcome.

Please let me know if you think you are coming so we do not radically under=
 or over feed.

See you there!

Directions:

From 59 and Wesleyan, go south through Bissonet, Rice and University lights=
.  The 3rd street after University is Byron.  Take a left.  It is the 5th h=

Terri, 

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.  Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim

Kim:

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.  Please let me know if these terms do not represent your understanding.

Hey,  did you call me this morning?  Sorry I missed it if you did.  Been running around like crazy - currently missing presentations trying to close a small (very!) deal.  If I don't talk to you, good luck with your pitch to your customer!  I hope you get the deal!

Gentlemen,

  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hi guys,

Attached is the swap picture we discussed.  I am working on some call prices as well and will send them asap.  Prices fell significantly today - probobly $.20 going one year out at the PG&E City gate.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Suzanne had previous plans so I thought that I didn't confirm the reservation.  I will be in the Grenadine Islands on the 14th - what's the occasion?  I think we will try to come in August some time.  Will that be OK?

Art, 

Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  Barry and I have discussed San Juan risks but we are willing to take it - however, the actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the Blanco Pool.  When you are ready to transact, I will update the exact price at that time.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,

Kim

Thanks Mike, we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,

Kim

You should pay me a visit this afternoon.  You might get a free watch!  come down the stairs and head towards 1oclock adn you will find me in the corner.

BTW, it turns out that the trader was just being an asshole and did not actually transact but was playing games with the structurer and caused the misunderstanding.  Although the result is the same since the trader is suddenly 'no bid'.  I guess he could even be lying about the transaction, but that would be pretty ballsy at this stage.

Gerald, 

I sent the following email to Jeff Hodge and Jason Williams on October 25th ad have heard nothing.  I reminded them this morning as we need to reply by mid next week.  Also, LDWP will be in our offices Monday afternoon.  Is this something that you can address faster than Jeff?  If so, just let him know and let me know how to proceed.  There was an article in the NGI publication this morning regarding this.

Thanks,

Kim

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Just talked to Noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared.  They want to do a 20 year, fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price.  All other gas outside the 10% swing will be priced at Gas Daily +/- $.05.  We are adding a $.25 premium on the 10% swing and the baseload is approximately 1000/day.  If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal, they would like to see what those are - that might sway them.

Jay, I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal.  And they have asked me for this credit information twice today.  It's all about you!!

Thanks a million for your help!

Will advise as to any netting benefits we may get regarding gas/power deals with Smurfit.  For now, the gas team does not want to take on any incremental risk with Smurfit from the physical gas perspective.

We can still look at case-by-case physical power deals with EPMI given the collateral that we're holding.

Tracy,
	Talked to Tanya regarding the long deal for SSCC and relayed to her your suggestion for handling gas.  She is ok with managing both gas and power through EPMI as long as legal is on board and all necessary EPMI docs are in place or amended (netting, physical gas), and that we are comfortable with the receivables risk to SSCC.  She actually mentioned that there has been discussions about merging EPMI and ENA into one entity to more properly handle net positions, so she seems to like your idea.  
	With that, I guess I'll pass this deal and legal relationship onto you unless you need or want me to help with any of this.  

Thanks,
Max

This is about credit working with HESCO right ?  IF so then we should know what ENA credit (Jason) is planning to discuss with HESCO, so I do feel that we should have that conversation with Jason prior to bringing anyone in.

The City of Glendale is ready to set up a conference call to go over the minor changes that they would like to see in the ISDA agreement.  Would you be available to do this call with them on Wednesday afternoon?  Please let me know as soon as possible if so and what time so I can set it up with the customer.

Also, they would like an electronic verson of the opinion letter.  Can you have one sent to me?

Call me if you have any questions - x30685.

Mara,

Here is the proposed revised contract with Citizens.  Could you take a look at it and see if the logic works in accordance with the spreadsheet?  sort of like how you built the original spreadsheet from the original contract.  Let me know if you have any questions and how this turns out.

Thanks,

Kim

Here is a very rough draft of the amendment that 1)  clarifies the gas pricing and 2) adds firm peaking gas.  I will call to discuss.

Mike,

I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.  It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.  (I will be out Monday)

Have a great weekend!  I hope this is helpful.

Kim

Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  

Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!



Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults. 

What do most people do on a date? 

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8 

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?  

I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age   

When is it okay to kiss someone? 

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7 

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.  
--Curt, age   

The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married? 

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8 

What is the right age to get married?  

No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6 

Is it better to be single or married?  

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them.  
--Anita, age 9 

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8

How do you decide who to marry? 

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? 

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 

What do your mom and dad have in  common? 

Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   

How would you make a marriage work?  

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10

Christopher J -

We missed you for sure!  It was a fun time.  I was glad to see everyone.  Nothing exciting took place - just a little dancing and visiting.  All went home at midnight.  Boy have we become boring in our old age!

Take care and keep in touch!

Kim,  how was Sat. night?  I didn't get finished at the Redbirds game until
10:30.  I couldn't have showered, changed and arrived before 11:45.  Didn't
think there was much of a chance anything was still going on at that time.
Hope all went well.  Bring me up to speed as to what went on.  Look forward
to hearing from you.

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help me put together the confirmation?  

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

MJ,

How are you doing?  Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!  How was your wine tour?  I thought about you guys.  It looked like so much fun!  Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!)  I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.  Let me know what you think!!  And I hope all is going well for you!

Cliff,

     For gas day December 6, 2001, Enron did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.  I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.  Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.  The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.  Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Ann,

I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:

1400 Smith Street, EB3206a
Houston, TX  77002

Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Hello again, 

Now that air travel is somewhat back to normal, Barry and I are rescheduling our trip to Southern California.  It is my understanding that the ISDA itself has been executed and required attachments are in the process of being gathered.  Therefore, you will soon have the option of transacting with Enron financially.   We are available to meet with you at any time on October 11th.  Please let me know if and when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

Again, we look forward to meeting with you and exploring new opportunities.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

The index prices are fine and may actually be lower.  I will check with my desk.  The fixed prices are only for one year.  Five year fixed price indications for Malin are $4.12 and for PG&E city Gate are $4.77.  Let me know if you need any thing else.

Hey!  Glad to hear you are well.  I have thought about our days on the 92nd floor as well.  Had some acquaintances that worked for Cantor as well as a close friend who worked for them that was called back to Houston for a meeting that very morning. Very glad he is with us today!  

It is cool that you hired Palmore.  You will have to tell him hello for me.  I did come back to Houston in January.  Enron brought me back to peddle gas in the West US.  Nothing much new in my life, just a new house and job - but I am glad to be back.  I miss the outdoor life in Portland but the people here are so much more fun and nice!  If you are ever in town - you better have a beer with me!  I will let you know if I am in Dallas -
Take care,

Kim

Hey Kim,
I just received that email about Halloween, pretty scary!
You won't believe this, but I just flew in from NY City.  My partner and I had to go there on business. I thought to myself several times over the past few weeks that you, Melissa and I worked in that building.  I wonder how many people just like you and I were lost and what that has meant to their families and friends.
So it looks like you moved to Houston. (Your email reply address had Houston in it.)  I hope everything is going well.  Is there any news in your life?
There is anotherstrangecoincidence.  I hired Palmore.  He starts Monday.  He'll bring a lot of experience with him to help us with some financial projects and operational improvements.
Let me know if you ever come to Dallas.  It would be nice to see you.

variable is all we reimburse them for - they are responsible for the demand.  Let me know if you need anything else with regards to the redwood capacity

Subject:	FW: Palo Alto Invoice

The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations.  It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas.  Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis.  In otherwords, when Palo Alto "Burns" less than we actualy schedule on the transport.  Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation.  I do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs, but I am not 100% certain.

Please let me know if ther are any other questions.

Thanks

Anne

Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

Subject:	Yuba City Cogen 5 yr gas deal

Kim,

We spoke last week about a possible 5 yr gas deal for our Yuba City plant.
Below is our RFP.  I'll call to discuss.

Thanks, Paul Cummins
916-996-2291 cell
916-447-5171 work

Request for Proposal ("RFP")
Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP
650 Bercut Drive, Suite C
Sacramento, CA  95814


Background.  Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP ("YCC") is the owner of a 49
megawatt cogeneration facility ("Facility") in Yuba City, California.  YCC
sells its 49 megawatts to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ("PG&E"), an entity
that recently filed for bankruptcy protection.  YCC recently entered into a
five-year, fixed-price electricity agreement with PG&E, and YCC desires to
enter into a long-term Natural Gas Supply Agreement ("NGSA") with an
appropriate supplier ("Seller") of natural gas.  The NGSA shall be subject to
approval of the YCC project lenders, and YCC will only be able to enter into
the NGSA after bankruptcy court approval of the five-year, fixed-price
electricity agreement with PG&E. As a result, YCC will require a daily update
to proposals it receives (to account for varying market conditions) until it
receives all necessary approvals to enter into a final NGSA.

Term. The term sheet contemplates either a three-year natural gas supply
agreement or a five-year natural gas supply agreement.  Under either term,
the starting date will be tentatively August 1, 2001, subject to the
necessary approvals.

Point(s) of Delivery.  PG&E City Gate.

Annual Volumes.  For the purposes of this RFP, it is assumed that the
Facility will consume monthly and annual gas volumes under one of three
different operating scenarios:

    Scenario        Annual Volume, mmBtu

       1                1,210,000


The typical, historical daily usage at the Facility has been 6,000 mmBtu/day,
except periods of maintenance or reduction by the Facility due to the
satisfaction of capacity requirements under its power purchase agreement
("PPA") with PG&E, and the typical, monthly historical usage has been based
upon a Monday through Friday operation.  Scenario 1 is indicative of plant
operations for the satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the PPA,
essentially 80%.

YCC would prefer a NGSA that is based upon annual volumes in a rolling
12-month period.

Monthly Balancing.  Monthly balancing on the PG&E system shall be the
Seller's responsibility, subject to the limitations of the YCC's natural gas
transportation agreement with PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules
and tariffs.  Seller shall be responsible for any gas imbalance charges
incurred on the PG&E System.

Usage Estimates.  For the purpose of assisting Seller in the Nomination
process, YCC shall make usage estimates in advance and as usage occurs.
Seller should specify requested frequency of usage estimates.

Monthly True-Up.  Actual usage at the Facility will almost certainly be of
some variance to the forecasted monthly gas volumes.  Seller shall propose a
means of "true-ing up" the actual usage to the forecasted monthly volumes.
The ideal system of true-ing up would allow for flexibility to both YCC and
Seller ("the Parties") under the following minimum circumstances:

1. True-up of variance between forecasted usage and actual, if any.

2. If gas price volatility has created daily or other market pricing that
creates financial incentive to the Parties to curtail deliveries to the
Facility and remarket the natural gas to the spot or other market.

3. Allowance for the Facility to curtail deliveries for planned or unplanned
maintenance.

Monthly true-up may incorporate resolution of the differences between price
and volume.

Day of Nomination.  The date of Nomination of daily gas volumes by the Seller
to the PG&E City Gate shall be at the option of, and as determined by Seller,
subject to the limitations of YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with
PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules and tariffs.

Maximum Daily Nomination Quantity:  YCC's natural gas transportation
agreement with PG&E allows for a maximum daily nomination quantity of 9,550
MMbtu/Day.

Price.  YCC seeks a NGSA that will provide a physical price hedge via three
alternative strategies.  The strategies are as follows:

Strategy        Price Hedge

       1            Fixed price for the term.
       2            Floating price, with a not-to-exceed cap.
       3            Floating price, with a minimum and maximum price.

YCC acknowledges that other hedging strategies exist and may be advisable for
the NGSA.  The Seller is encouraged to supply a proposal that incorporates
other strategies.

Credit and Payment Terms.  YCC can offer the following credit and payment
mechanisms for the purpose of removing credit and payment concern from the
Seller:

1. Semi-Monthly Payment. Semi-Monthly payment for gas based on expected
consumption over the first fifteen (15) calendar-day period of each month,
and the expected consumption over the balance of each month via a wire from
YCC to be made one day following the receipt of payments for electrical
energy from PG&E.

2. Priority payment.  YCC has an agreement with its lender that costs of fuel
shall have first priority in the waterfall of cash flows, i.e. the fuel
supplier shall be paid from project cash flows prior to the payment of all
other costs incurred, including repayment of debt, operations and maintenance
costs, management fees, etc.

RFP Response may be sent via fax to Paul Cummins @ 916-447-7602.  Please call
916-447-5171 for questions.

Jack,

Thanks so much for the message.  You are right, we are still a great trading organization.  Unfortunately, we had some people outside this organization make mistakes.  As for Tuesday, lets play it by ear.  I think we will continue to be a business and I still consider you a great customer.  Call me when you get into town and I will have a lot more information to share.

Thanks again for your email -

Kim

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Besides making this consistant and pretty, how does this spreadsheet look to you?  Am I leaving anything out?  According to the desk, they didn't take much during July.

Kelli,

I sold a swap to Merced for 2,040/d that goes through Feb 03 for $7.85.  Can we look at a blend & extend that starts Jan. 02 and we would extend our deal out to Dec. 05?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello again,

I talked to Mary Jo yesterday and exchanged emails with Tricia - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If Tricia didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  

I do wish you would come down here with Jeff sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  Jeff could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!

Yes - I am still hanging out with Pete.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun! 

Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!

Love, Kim

I'm glad that you're doing well. Crazy world we live in now... scary!! Tricia Tlapek sent me an e-mail... it looks like she may try and organize a girl's get together w/ Mary Jo - it would GREAT fun to meet up with you there!!!

Jeff's traveling a lot less than he was... I'm sure he'll be down to Houston again in the not-too-distant future though. I'll try and swing a weekend at some point when he's down there - it would be fun to meet up in Houston too!

I'm glad to hear from you and looking forward to meeting up with you soon. Are you still hanging out with Pete??? 

I hope you're well! Miss you!!!

Laura,

Just wanted to drop you a note to see how things are with you.  With the things that happened a couple of weeks ago, our travel has been put off for a while.  I am still trying to plan a trip to N. Cali - perhaps in October sometime.  Since my Aruba trip has been cancelled, I have a little more time.  I will keep you posted and hopefully you would still like to visit Mary Jo and perhaps the spa or wine country.  Maybe we can get Vanny out there with us!  

Is Jeff still traveling back and forth alot?  The weather here just got a big break and it is very cool outside.  How is it there?  My favorite month in Portland is October, with the trees changing colors.  Anyway - must get back to work.  Talk to you soon!

Hey,

What's been going on?  Hopefully something besides work!  Finally getting moved in - well - almost.  Still have the junk room!  Went to mexico for a few days and it rained the entire time, which wasn't much fun.  Hoefully my next trip will be better!   anyway, it looks like I will be in Phoenix June 28 - 29.  If you are around, I would love to get together!

Hope all is well -

K.

Funny - I get an email from you and Keith Aaron on the same day!  Not much going on - just settling down and staying home a while since I traveled non-stop June and July.  I have planned to go to Aruba in October (16th - 20) and then to St. Martin etal in January.Come to Aruba and bring friends.  We are staying at the Allegra Resort all-inclusive.  But we are somewhat boring - sun, san, surf, and a few suds.

Let me know what else is going on!  Oh, yeah - my home email address is kward1@houston.rr.com.  My boss is nosy and reads my emails!

Take Care,

Kimmie

Hello everyone,

I got an email yesterday from Jack confirming our meeting on Monday at 2 p.m.  In light of the recent tragic events and the chaotic state that the commercial airline industry is in, Barry and I will not be traveling to California next week.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  We do plan to come out to California to see you guys at a later date.  Once things have settled down and we are able to re-schedule, we will be in touch.  

Steve, I am working with Legal to have executable documents sent to you and will keep you posted.  Thanks again for your patience.

Please call me if any of you need anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kelli,

When you have a chance this morning, can we update the blend and extend with Merced?  Still an indication.  They will transact at some point, maybe not until next week but they will do something.  They are leaning towards this blend though.

thanks for your help,

Kim

I'm working on a toll for S. Rosman; could you provide a bid adjuster (I'm using yesterday's mid curves) for PG&E CityGate for 2 deals. Both start 6/1/02; one is for 1 year and the other is for 15 years....so ending 5/31/03 and 5/31/17. Thanks

Megan,

Mara has been terminated so I looked in our files and found a spreadsheet for November.  However, it doesn't have the volumes filled in. Shannon Groenewald should be able to provide you with the actual volumes and all you should have to do is add them to this spreadsheet.  I have copied Shannon on this email so she should expect to hear from you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Lou, 

Attached is the RFP response we discussed.  Enron has the capability of offering an array of risk management products.  We are unable to provide gas to you at Malin as we do not own firm transportation on the Redwood line.  Please call me with any questions that you might have.

Janette,

I did leave you a voice message.  The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.  Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Janette,

Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in
order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the
guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable
to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP
BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day
but have moved back up.

Megan,

Are we going to owe Pasadena money for every invoice?  If not, since we owe them so much on this one, is there a way we can offset with future invoices where they owe us money?  Can we check into that?

Let me know - 

Kim

Please see the attached website for details.   http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html << File: http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html >> 
 
If there are enough people interested I was thinking of  arranging the rental of a party van/shuttle bus for the day Sunday November  4th, from 10:00 - 5:00 leaving from my house in the Marina.  After  talking with a few limo companies, the price per person for limo/shuttle  service will probably be around $50 - $60 for the day.
 
Please let me know tomorrow if you are available and  interested in participating. 
Please forward this email to others I may have missed on the  list too!
Thanks!
MJ

I would like to change my United Way contribution to zero and it looks like Kathy is no longer with us.  Who should I send my request to at this point?

Chris,

Can you send or fax me a copy of the contract between us/Citizens and EARMS?  I don't have a copy and i need one in order to get these invoices processed.

Kim

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Kim

Chris,
The owner of an underground gas storage facility called me today asking to contact a person in Enron regarding the possibility of leasing his storage. It is a depleted gas reservoir in Antioch, near the Sacramento River. It is connected to the Calpine system, but it is not connected to the PG&E system. Its capacity is six bcf and currently contains one bcf. It is surrounded by several hundred available acres if you wanted to consider building a power plant.  

If anyone in ENA might be interested in talking to this guy, could you please refer them to Ken Beebe whose phone is 925-837-9019. Thanks!

Sara,

Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thanks for your help,

Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Would you be available to do this call with them on Wednesday afternoon?  Please let me know as soon as possible if so and what time so I can set it up with the customer.

Also, they would like an electronic verson of the opinion letter.  Can you have one sent to me?

I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!

We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!

Talk to you later -

Love,  Kim

Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!  And you thought I had a strong personality!!!  Going to Palo Alto Thursday - hope to get a management services deal.

        It's been a little while  since I last spoke to you (about the call option), but I'm checking if you have  a refreshed price for a 39 months firm gas supply at the PG&E Citygate  to run from 6/1/03-8/31/06.  The volume would be at least 5,000  dth/day.  I'd also like to see the indicative prices of a "no-cost" collar  for this time period; for example, if I'm interested in a ceiling at  $5.00, would the floor price be $3.75/dth, $4.00/dth?  The call  options premiums were just too expensive.
 
    If you have any  questions, give me a call.  And thanks again for all your  help.

chris,

Here is what is going on with Citizens right now:

1)  Mike Grigsby and Randy Gay are reviewing the revisions to the Griffith contract from their perspective.  I will have Patti review it once they are done.  I looked at your peaking language and was not able to enhance it.  However, does the new calculation address any unanticipated pipeline rate changes such that the demand margin or sales margin could be negetive?
2)  interuptible gas will flow right now to Nogales from the Waha pool, according to Pattie
3)  I am attaching a summary of the conference call we had on the 18th and would like your input before sending it out.
4) the capacity release was posted and matched successfully.

Let me know ifyou have any questions.

thanks,

Kim

Sorry guys, I need to clarify my previous request.  SMUD is looking for a financial call option at Malin (or Aeco) with the strike 10% above today's market and 20% above today's market for 5000/day.  Term is April 01 through Mar 03.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Larry,
	Yesterday I noticed a small collar executed with the above entity.  We have no legal documents with this CP so would like to send out credit in the confirm.  There is little exposure to this CP, but I'd still like to cover the bases.  Please advise if this is ok with you.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Mr. Dossett,

I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!

And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win?

Steve, 

Attached is a draft copy of our master purchase/sale contract that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will have my legal department standing by to assist.

Kelli,

When you have a chance this morning, can we update the blend and extend with Merced?  Still an indication.  They will transact at some point, maybe not until next week but they will do something.  They are leaning towards this blend though.

thanks for your help,

Kim

If the file is a small blue box with deal numbers and prices, I can open it.

Would you do a favor for me?  Were you able to (or can you now) open the attached Excel spreadsheet and read it?  When I send spreadsheets to Darla she can't open them.  She said they appear as a .dtf file extension and are unusable.  I've sent attached spreadsheets to people at more than a half dozen different companies and haven't had anyone else say they can't open them.  So I'm wondering if someone else at ENRON can open it.
Thanks,

Here is what Charlie Sanchez sent.  He said we purchased 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29 and a total of 240,000 fixed price NYMEX.  He said it looks like you missed the purchase from 12/28/00 and it seems like you only show 100,000 of the 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29.  Ask Kim what she thinks.

Craig,
 
In the month of August, EPME nominated the requested volumes to 9JZ2 (Citizen's San Juan Pool Contract).  The nomination was not confirmed by your operations group, thus the nominated volume was reduced to zero.  To answer your question, I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates.  If you have any questions about the nominating procedure, please contact Jason Kelm (713-420-6038).  In regards the month of September, the first day the gas was confirmed was 9-8-01.  So far, 10,313 mmbtus have been delivered.

I sent the message below at the end of August and the one below that at the end of July.  

The only problem is that NO gas was scheduled during August and I can't find any gas for September!  Now the imbalance has grown larger instead of smaller!!  

I also need gas for October.  What do I need to do to get this scheduled and confirmed for October?

Hello everyone, 

Attached is a spreadsheet showing all fixed price deals that I have done with Pasadena as well as my term sheet for February and March.  I am working with Patti and Anne Bike to make sure things are in the system as best they can be.  Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be glad to help you as much as I can.  I am out of the office until Monday.

Thanks,

Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?  And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?

Thanks,

Kim

I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62.  I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her.  Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August?  Again, I do not have all of the information for July and August, so I cannot give you any numbers.  If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil.  I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do.

FYI-I will be out of the office all next week.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not =
much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a=
 change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think t=
hat there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that par=
t.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice. =
 Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suza=
nne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with C=
orporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay o=
n with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this w=
ay, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES=
 gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Than=
ksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip=
 - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse =
to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out wi=
th myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?=
  I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the ho=
liday season and time for (good) cheer!

Kim,

I met with the lovely Bruno Jeider last week.  If I were to characterize him, I would have to say that he reminds me of Schultz from "Hogan's Heroes".  He sees nothing.  He knows nothing.

I asked him about SCE's impending bankruptcy.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about his gas/power positions.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about Burbank's power plant development.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him if he knew how to please a woman.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

In short, if you plan to meet with Burbank, make sure your meeting includes their traders.

Jason,

I need your help on 2 EASY things -

1)  I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.  United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.  What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?  And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.

2)  THIS IS REAL DEAL:  Merced Irrigation District.  They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.  I gave them an indication of $3.85.  I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.  Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?  They were concerned about what credit would require.  

Please let me know as soon as possible!  I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!

Thanks,

Kim

Kim -
I looked over the spreadsheet and I am available this afternoon around 2:00 PM and tomorrow afternoon.  Please let me know when you are available.  You may want to include Patti and/or Ann when we meet since they would drive any Sitara changes that will have to be made.

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Kim

Hi guys,

Could we provide a price indication to PNM for a physical call option (offer) for Cal 02 and Q3, 2002 for San Juan gas?  Let start with $.50 out of the money and $1.00 out of the money.  This would be a monthly option.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim, just for planning purposes, what would it cost to have a call option 
for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
from the San Juan basin? 
Thanks

All are seasoned clinicians.  I've had good reports from persons that have been to see them.  If the arrangment works well for you here, let me know.  In any event the sessions from this point carry a $20 co-pay.  Insurance picks up the rest.  Let me know who you schedule an appointment with and I will get the authorization for the first 6  visits.  Subsequent visits will be authorized by the provider.

I was working out at 5:30 this a.m.!  What's the matter with you?  Were you able to get the trailer off of your truck?  When I got home, Suzanne came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.  Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met Suzanne at the park for a jog.  Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City. 

Lonely, huh?  When does Lawrence move in?

I had fun with Rob.  I played horribly on what is a very short, but tight and tricky course.  88.  Then we had dinner at Champs.  I played Mr. Domestic and put Miracle Grow on all my shrubs and flowers.  My mom told me to do it a month ago and I have blown it off and some stuff died.  What an ingrate.

Hey Lyndon,

How are you?  Long time - no email!  I hope things are going well for you.  Went to Happy Hour with Kim 1, Susie, Stacy, and Melissa last night.  Susie and Stacy just got back from the Bahamas.  Kim 1 and Melissa left today for Cabo San Lucas.  As for me, I am painting the inside of my house.  Not nearly as much fun.  But with this economy combined with my company's 3rd quarter earnings - my net worth is the worst it has been in YEARS!!!!  In other words - I am poor!  

Anyway, we were talking about our upcoming trip on the Poly in January and we were all wondering (especially me) if you had decided to remain in Austrailia or rejoin Casey on the boat.  I think we all hope we see you in Jan! 

Gotta go back to work and try to get this stock price back up - take care, keep in touch, and let me know what fun things you have been up to!

Love, K2

el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?

Art, 

We have priced these at the money puts and they are kind of expensive.  For the monthly put, Strike of $2.72, premium would be $.495.  For the Daily put, the premium would be $.535.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Prices might be lower tomarrow given the downturn since AGA's came out.  If you are willing to look at out of the money puts, the price would be better as well.

Thanks,

Kim

Thanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -

Kim

Heya.  Hope things are good.  How are you looking with the buyout?  I
haven't heard any screams from Midtown so I'll take that as a good sign.
Thought this might put a smile on your face.

Darla, 

As far as I can tell, Craig's requests are ok.  Also, the NSP and gelber invoices you sent me look ok.  I am attaching my manual spreadsheet for the deals I have done from August forward.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Remember to use this spreadsheet in conjunction with what is in the system.

Mara,

I am just sending you this spreadsheet.  This has nothing to do with the Griffith deal.  We can discuss later.

Thanks,

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this?

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice?

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

So do we have a special agreement in place for the full requirements gas deal?  I think that you did that deal before I came to the gas desk.  How can I get a copy of the penalty language?

Darla,

Attached is a spreadsheet we prepared that details August business with Citizens regarding the Griffith deal.  Please use this to prepare your invoice.  Also, please inform me if they do not pay us by the due date.  John Cogan should not be paid until we get paid by Citizens.

Please call me and we can discuss the spreadsheet as there are cells that must be verified against the TW invoice as well as Sitara.  In addition to billing Citizens, the following entries need to be made each month:

1)  payment to John Cogan
2)  origination to Kim Ward and Chris Foster (50/50)
3)  payment to EARMS for the $.02 insurance Chris negotiated

These amounts are dealed in the last three columns of the spreadsheet.

There may be some updates to the spreadsheet that will create some prior adjustments but these should be ironed out soon.  Call me when you get a chance.

Thanks,

Kim

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Would the contract be with Citizens or Gelber?  I have tried numerous times in the past to get an ISDA with Citizens but their corporate leaders have always been hesitant to enter into derivative transactions.

Hey Chris,

I don't know what these gelber guys have in mind but I thought You might be interested.  I have been working on an ISDA for about 3 weeks.  what do you think they want to do with power?  Call me when you have a minute and let me know if you want to be involved.

Kim,
 
We are very interested in putting in place  an ISDA for weather derivatives, power, and natural gas transactions in regards  to Citizens Communications.  Please get with me as to Enron's interest no  later than Monday, April 23rd.  There is also some opportunity to do  physical power purchase and sales with Citizen's.  It might be worthwhile  for you to set up a meeting with you, me, and the appropriate power guy (Mike  Grigsby?).
 
Hope all is well.
 
Sincerely,

Sara,

I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Thanks for looking at this for us.  When do you think you will have a chance to review it?  I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.  Also, do we need to have credit re-review?  Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.
 
Thanks,

VERY Cool!  I will keep you posted on the structure that we are focusing on.  Right now it is Nymex + physcial basis.  They will lock in basis but not Nymex.  We can talk about the potential risks there if you want.

Chris,

Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans. the main issue is as follows:

1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.

I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.  I am working with Darla and Ann to get the orig granted.

thanks,

Kim

Jay,

Attached is the GTC that El Paso Electric took to the top for approval.  As discussed yesterday, we would prefer to put a Master in place instead of just GTC.  Can we send them a master with the EXACT language?  Please let me know ASAP.

Hey Steve,

     I'm still waiting on info from Stacy regarding adding language to your contract.  Just wanted to keep you posted.  If I don't talk to you, have a great long weekend and I will talk to you on Tuesday.

Thanks,

Kim

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - 

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!

Keep in touch -
K.

k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....

Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.

Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Thanks so much for sending the CDs.  I really didn't think I would ever see them again!  I take it that you are still considering coming back to windjammer.  I guess it will depend on what happens when you get home.  Kim 1, Stacy, Susie and I are considering the Poly trip in January.  I haven't been to those islands (St. Martin, St. Barts, etc.) yet so I might have to go.

I can't imagine a place better than the caribbean - I would love to see it!  So if you're not serious - don't tease me!

Take care and thanks again for the CDs -
Love,
K2

Thanks, Beth.  Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any questions.  I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new contracts.  If you guys need anything   while we are waiting on those, please let me know!  Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.  

Thanks,

In light of the recent events here at enron and the uncertainty surrounding all of our employment, I would like each of you to have my home email address so that you can keep in touch.  No matter what happens, the work email address will change, whether I stay at Enron and we are aquired or I change companies.  Who knows what will happen or what the timing will be!  Donations can be made to - just kidding!  Hope all is well with all of you!

Kelli,

I sold a swap to Merced for 2,040/d that goes through Feb 03 for $7.85.  Can we look at a blend & extend that starts Jan. 02 and we would extend our deal out to Dec. 05?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

J.,  Sorry, I sent the other email before I got this one.  The contact that I would recommend at NCPA is Dean Park, 916-781-4224.  He will either help you or can direct you to someone else.  You can reference the RFP if you would like.

You are right, NCPA is a consorsium of Munis.  The ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the Cities of Roseville, Lodi, Lompoc, and Alameda.
The transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 5000/day at city gate for 2002-2004.  We would be buying back $3.37 Physical BASIS for 2002.  This would be a sort of blend and extend.

Our deal would be Physical Basis.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim -

Do you have a contact at NCPA that I could call to discuss credit issues?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think NCPA is simply an operating agency for numerous California communities' utilities, and I need to investigate how obligations flow from NCPA to the member municipalities.

Also, is the deal that you are considering with them a financial or physical deal?

Gerald & Stacy,

I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Don,

Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?

Thanks,

Kim Ward

H. & C. were suppose to get back from Hawaii on Saturday.  H had to leave on Sunday for Maine but was suppose to return last night or today.  I don't have Mrs. Mauney's number but I think my mom has it if you want to call her - 901-396-0399.  Still trying to figure out this weekend.  I would love to play golf instead of go to that dumb picnic.  One problem is that I pulled the daylights out of my left hamstring and it is affecting my game.  I will keep you posted.

Hello everyone,

I got an email yesterday from Jack confirming our meeting on Monday at 2
p.m.  In light of the recent tragic events and the chaotic state that
the commercial airline industry is in, Barry and I will not be traveling
to California next week.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may
have caused.  We do plan to come out to California to see you guys at a
later date.  Once things have settled down and we are able to
re-schedule, we will be in touch.

Steve, I am working with Legal to have executable documents sent to you
and will keep you posted.  Thanks again for your patience.

Please call me if any of you need anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Dynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise' (Update5)

Dynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise' (Update5)

     (Updates share prices in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. Chairman Chuck
Watson said he's convinced Enron Corp.'s trading operations are
sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that
helped drive Enron's stock down 67 percent in three weeks as
``financial noise.''
     Dynegy agreed Friday to buy Enron for at least $23 billion,
including at least $8 billion in stock and $15 billion in assumed
debt. Dynegy shares rose as much as 16 percent today. Enron rose
as much as 20 percent.
     In an interview after the merger announcement, Watson and
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay discussed how the Houston-based
companies reached agreement less than three weeks after Enron's
shares began plunging.
     ``All the financial noise about the partnerships, maybe it
has damaged the Enron brand a bit,'' Watson said. ``But I'll tell
you what it hasn't impacted, and that's the high regard that the
industry places on'' Enron's trading business, he said.
     Enron last week restated earnings for four years to include
losses from three affiliated partnerships, reducing earnings by
$586 million.
     Six employees, out of Enron's 20,000, may have improperly
benefited from the partnerships, Lay said.
     ``I'm sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over
the edge in their dealings or transactions, but you can't be
absolutely protected from that in any business,'' he said.

                        Lost Effectiveness

     Lay didn't specify which six people he was referring to. He
removed Andrew Fastow, who helped set up and ran many of the
affiliated partnerships, as chief financial officer on Oct. 24. An
Enron securities filing says Fastow made more than $30 million off
two of the partnerships.
    Fastow ``had lost his effectiveness because of all the press
coverage'' on the affiliates, Lay said.
     Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing
director and a corporate counsel for an Enron division, also were
fired, Enron said in a corporate filing on Thursday. Former
employees Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager were in a
position to profit from partnerships, the filing said.
     ``You trust people, you accept their representations and
proposals,'' Lay said. ``Sometimes when you do that, you get
surprised and disappointed.''
      Both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to
approve the merger because the two companies own different types
of assets and won't dominate any market.
    ``There really isn't anything that lays on top of each
other,'' Watson said Friday night. ``We're not in the pipeline
business and they are. We're in the generation business, and
they're really not.''
     Dynegy shares rose 6.2 percent on Friday after terms of the
Enron purchase leaked to the press. Watson expects the acquisition
to add 90 cents to 95 cents a share, or 35 percent, to Dynegy's
2002 earnings. Enron is selling for $10.41 a share, one-fifth the
average price over the past 12 months.
     Enron stock climbed 97 cents, or 11 percent, to $9.60 in late
morning trading. Earlier, they touched $10.38. Dynegy rose $4.54,
or 12 percent, to $43.30 after touching $45.

                            Cash Crunch

     The rapid decline of Enron threatened to bankrupt the company
and disrupt energy markets. Enron handles an estimated one-quarter
of U.S. electricity and natural-gas trades. A falling credit
rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed
to back trades.
     As part of the purchase, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion.
     ``What we found when looked under the hood is that the core
of Enron was still there and working as well as ever,'' Watson
said. ``That business was pristine and had nothing to do with the
partnerships.''
     Dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late
October, when Watson called Lay to offer assistance with Enron's
growing financial crisis, the two men said. That led to a Saturday
morning meeting in Lay's kitchen.
     ``He even made me a breakfast roll,'' Watson said.
     ``He didn't eat it,'' Lay said.
     Lay said he won't be an active manager in the new company.
Watson said Friday that he and Lay hadn't discussed a severance
package.
     As head of Enron, Lay had refocused the Houston operator of
U.S. natural-gas pipelines on trading and international expansion,
boosting reported revenue 20-fold since 1995 to $100.8 billion
last year. He said he doesn't regret the strategy.
     ``Clearly, Enron has gotten involved in business that hasn't
turned out well,'' Lay said, pointing to money-losers Azurix Inc.,
created to supply water and build related projects around the
world, and NewPower Holdings Inc., a seller of electricity to
homes and small businesses. ``But you have to keep in mind, too,
that 12 years ago we weren't in the wholesale merchant (trading)
business. Today that's an incredibly valuable franchise.''
     The trading business, which accounts for about 97 percent of
Enron's revenue, buys electricity, gas and other commodities from
producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and
industrial customers. It also advises big business customers on
energy use and sells them gas and electricity.

                     Reassessing Steel, Lumber

     Watson said the new company will keep trading coal, gas,
power and petroleum products, and plans to expand by buying assets
and using them to develop trading. ``We'll just have to reassess
over time whether we stay in'' trading of steel, lumber and other
non-energy commodities, he said.
     Enron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power Co.
in India, which is owed $64 million in overdue bills from a state
government agency that has refused to pay the power prices Enron
was promised in contracts.
     ``We have strong legal remedies and we're heading down the
path toward arbitration, but we'd still very much like to work out
a settlement with the government,'' Lay said. Potential buyers
have balked at Enron's $1 billion asking price for Dabhol.
     Neither man would comment on whether Dynegy plans to cut jobs
after the merger, or what will happen to the naming rights to
Enron Field. The Major League baseball stadium is home to the
Houston Astros, and Enron paid $100 million to have its name on
the ballpark.
     ``The name of the company is now Dynegy,'' Watson said.
     Dynegy's acquisition requires approval from U.S. securities,
antitrust and energy regulators. Watson expects soon to share
details of the new Dynegy with regulators from the European Union
and U.K., where Enron operates a trading desk and owns a water
company and two power plants.
     ``I don't know if we are required to do so, but we will talk
to them anyway,'' Watson said.
     ``We don't think there are going to be any problems,'' Lay
said.

Sure enough, natural gas rallied over 20% the  following week. This may be no more than a short covering rally, as double  bottomsare always to be viewed with suspiciously. Thus far, in the month of  August, natural gas has taken out both the July lows and the July highs forming  an outside bar on the month. Will need to monitor the 2nd  qtr close of 2001closely to gauge whether the July and August double bottom  is going to hold or not. At the very least, the double bottom makes a   fantastic momentum low, if not the actual intermediate bear market price  low.

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Terri,

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the
TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit -
but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -
thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
Let's get together for a beer soon -

They are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from Noresco as soon as they can.  They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.  Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?  Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.  
what do you think?  I will keep you posted on discussions.

Thanks!

Kim

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination

I understand the need to find cheap flights. this whole enron meltdown has forced us all to take a closer look at our personal balance sheets. i imagine it might be pretty hard to take monday off, but one option would be to catch a morning flight home on monday. i'd be very inclined to do so, but it may be hard for you guys. maybe you have some work to do in California?? i will probably stay through sunday night. check with southwest airlines-- they may have a cheaper fare to oakland, and i can definitely get you to that airport. any thoughts on who else from houston might want to come down?

Debra,

A couple of weeks ago, Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet to you to prepare an Enfolio agreement for Imperial Irrigation District.  I will be forwarding an RFP response to them Friday which is required to include our draft contract.  I haven't received a copy of this draft.  Could you forward this to me at your earliest convenience?

Steve,

I need your help with something.  I want to look at Pasadena's load profile and am having trouble obtaining this.  Is it possible for you to send me your actual daily burns for up to the past two years?  This would be helpful in assisting you with your risk management needs and with structuring products specifically for Pasadena.

Let me know if you can help.

Thanks,

Kim

We did have fun - Camille was interested in the other Chris and wouldn't leave - I think we were loaded too. 

 Sorry for flirting a little too much - I don't know if you told Stanton that I hit on you until 5 in the morning or if he just read that into your story - but it drove him crazy. He called my house at 2:30 am Sunday morning very drunk and being very wierd!  

Anyway, it was a great party - thanks for the invitation.  Until next time -

I don't know if any of their changes will include the credit annex or not.

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.  I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

I have been wondering all week whether you got on the boat.  I looked at continental's specials and their weren't any for this weekend.  But if you plan ahead or are flexible on flight times, you can definitely get here for less than $200!

HOw was the rest of your trip?  Anything exciting to report?  How was your time with Turbo?  

I wish it were last wednesday!  I think I am going to sell all of my belongings and live on a beach somewhere!!

Let me know what's going on!

Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?  And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?

I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her.  Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August?  Again, I do not have all of the information for July and August, so I cannot give you any numbers.  If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil.  I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do.

FYI-I will be out of the office all next week.

Chris,
I have arranged for Janie and Patti to be available for a conference call at 11:30 CDT, 9:30 PDT.  I will get Patti and Janie on the phone and then call you.  Let me know if you have a conflict.

Thanks,

Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.  Funny how things can change in just one week!  Suzanne is awesome - don't know what I would do without her.  We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.  Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.  (See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)

Take care and keep in touch.

Good to see you....sorry it was a bad time for you.  Things will get better.
It was nice meeting Suzanne and Elizabeth.  Suzanne seems like a really neat
person.  Did ya'll hang out late?  I didn't want to run off but I thought
you probably needed some quality "girl time".

It is right behind 3112.  There are only 3 garden homes inside the gate -
and 3110 is real big on my double green doors.  Call if you get lost -

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

See you then -

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Willis,

I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.

Thanks,

Kim

Kelli,

Can you help me price up a call option structure for Pasadena?  They want to Buy a Nymex Call with a strike of $3.50  for July - September 02 and they want to reduce the premium by selling us a $5.50 call for the same period.  Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks,

Steve,

These are some examples of the blend and extend deals that we discussed earlier.  Like I said, these are just some examples that we came up with but we can look at different terms and volumes for each of them.  Let me know if you have questions and we can go over this any time.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

I met with the lovely Bruno Jeider last week.  If I were to characterize him, I would have to say that he reminds me of Schultz from "Hogan's Heroes".  He sees nothing.  He knows nothing.

I asked him about SCE's impending bankruptcy.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about his gas/power positions.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about Burbank's power plant development.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him if he knew how to please a woman.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

In short, if you plan to meet with Burbank, make sure your meeting includes their traders.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

But Oregon would be eaten alive by Miami - they haven't played anyone this year.  Just got a call about a power originator job in Denver.  Interesting!

I looked over the spreadsheet and I am available this afternoon around 2:00 PM and tomorrow afternoon.  Please let me know when you are available.  You may want to include Patti and/or Ann when we meet since they would drive any Sitara changes that will have to be made.

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Kim

Bob, 

I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.

Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,
 
Thanks for forwarding the Collateral Assignment document this  morning.  Our counsel has given it his blessing and we are ready to proceed  with execution of the Agreement with on exception.
 
The only change needed from our perspective is the  following:
 
                 SECTION 6, Paragraph (g).
 
                 Upon termination of the Master Agreement and  confirmation from the Secured Party that all obligations                           thereunder have been satisfied in full in the form  attached as Exhibit B hereto, the Escrow Agent shall remit                  to  the Secured Party any funds remaining in the collateral  account.
 
 
                 We think that the last sentence contains a typographical  error, and that it should read ...the Escrow Agent shall remit to                  the  Grantor any funds remaining in the collateral account.
 
Please let me know if your attorneys agree after their  review.
 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I don't know what to do.  Boss says I don't need to look for a job and they will have to find some $$ to keep people. don't know that I want to be among the 7000 enron employees beating the streets.   Any suggestions?  there have been no formal announcements of layoffs but Logically, I feel like about 50% of my friends here will loose their jobs.  Especially the ones not associated with gas or power.  The world is in turmoil!  Wish I had my sailboat and 6 mos. $$ to live on - I would go to the caribbean and stay for a while.

Hello all, 

	I am sorry to send this bad news.  Yesterday Susie's father had a massive coranary.  I took Susie home around 2:00 yesterday so that she could pack and take off to Louisianna.  It is my understanding as of right now that he is/was brain dead and they were going to pull the plug yesterday.  I am going to get the information and send flowers.  Do any of you want in?  Please let me know.  Thanks all, I hope to be the bearer of good news next time.  Stacey

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Hi Jeff,

Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:

Q4, 2001                			    $11.70
2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80
5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85
Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38

I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.

Regards,

Kim Ward

Kim:

It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume.

Can you please check and get back to John?

Chris,

Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there
are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send
SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the
delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon
is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the
additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon
received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due.

It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the
volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In
any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's
review.

Best regards,
John Ewing

I just heard from the Hesco guys and they would like to set up a meeting or conference call to discuss the master and collateral assignment documents.  I think that they have some questions and comments.  Please let me know when you are available and  your preference, meeting or conference call, and I will set it up.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a "material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," it warned.

19:23 19Nov2001 RSF-Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.
    The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week.   That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.
    If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash.
    The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat.
    Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said.
    On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported.
    It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.
    Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," the company wrote.
    Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.
    CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER
    Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to "Baa3" and "BBB-minus," just one notch above "junk" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects  commercial paper, to "Not Prime," a junk rating.
    In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.
    All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner.
    Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.
    The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock.
    In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of "the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures."
    Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

A 10 year fixed price indication at the PG&E City Gate out of Jan. 02 is approximately $3.32.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know how I can help facilitate the blend with Merced.

Let me know if there is any thing else that you need.

Kim,  can you help Merced out with a 10-year PG&E city-gate price assuming a  1/1/2002 start (see message below).  I'll get them the electricity  price.  Indicative price is fine.  We are not going to  transact.
 
Got  your message too about gas prices moving up.  We are still looking at the  blend/extend versus an outright swap of the last almost 3 years.  I'll be  in touch.
 
Thanks  for your help.

Hello everyone,

I got an email yesterday from Jack confirming our meeting on Monday at 2
p.m.  In light of the recent tragic events and the chaotic state that
the commercial airline industry is in, Barry and I will not be traveling
to California next week.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may
have caused.  We do plan to come out to California to see you guys at a
later date.  Once things have settled down and we are able to
re-schedule, we will be in touch.

Steve, I am working with Legal to have executable documents sent to you
and will keep you posted.  Thanks again for your patience.

Please call me if any of you need anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hello again,

Attached is a worksheet showing price indications for Calls that are $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00 out of the money.  I priced the puts that you would sell to me as 25% and 50% of the call premiums.

I did this for Aeco, Permian, and San Juan.  Let me know if there is another way that you would like to look at them.

Thanks,

Kim

Craig,

I agree with Charlie.  I wasn't here until January so I was not aware of the Dec. 28 deal.  I think that when we do August, my information should be complete.  Sorry for all of the inconveniences.  Thanks for your help.

Kim

p.s.  I will tell Darla.

Here is what Charlie Sanchez sent.  He said we purchased 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29 and a total of 240,000 fixed price NYMEX.  He said it looks like you missed the purchase from 12/28/00 and it seems like you only show 100,000 of the 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29.  Ask Kim what she thinks.

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Subject:	September Nominations


Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-
 
The total nomination for month of September 2001 is 17,027MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the following:
 
1. 4,027MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses 4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa@ $7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
8  2,500MMBtu/day under a Q3 contract @ $8.925/MMBtu that we had forgotten about earlier...
 
 
Losses on the PG & E line have increased from August 2001 to 2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect, temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit (Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during the month.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve

Good morning Kim, 
You mentioned yesterday that Enron had some EP capacity to sell.  Well,  
Citizens is wanting to know if Enron could make firm sales to it for gas to  
its electric generating facility, Valencia, located in Nogales, AZ.  As I  
recall the gas requirements are in the range of 1 to 2 MMcf per day.   
I have the following questions which I would like to discuss with you on this  
subject: 
1) Is there sufficient available capacity on the pipeline that will allow the  
gas to flow? 
2) Could you make deliveries for the month of August and possibly September? 
3) What would be the delivered price? 
4) What is the expectation of this gas showing up everyday? 
Give me a call on my cell phone to discuss>

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?

John,

Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.  I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of Stephanie Miller who is the tport expert in our group.  Then you can decide how you would like to persue.  Stephanie will be available in the morning before 11:00 am CDT.

Please give me a call when you can -

Thanks,

Kim

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does not take it out on us in the furture.

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were "gone," the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

The physical basis offer indication for Dec - March at the City Gate is about $.32.  The fixed price indiation for the 38 month period you mentioned is approximately $4.39.    We need to discuss this structure in detail if you are serious about buying physical gas from us and we also need to get contracts in place. 
Let me know if there is anything else you need.

thanks,

Kim

Kim: 
        I'm checking into a  PG&E citygate basis differential for the 4-months Dec.thru March off the  NYMEX for United Cogen in San Franscisco.  Right now, the 4-month  strip is about $3.03/dth. Whoops, make that $3.26/dth.
 
    Also, I'm checking  into a price for a 38 months firm gas supply at the Citygate to run from  6/1/03-7/31/06.  The volume would be in the 5,000-5,500 dth/day  range.  Everything at United was put on hold following the 9/11  disaster.  If you have any  questions, give me a call.  Is now a good time to buy Enron stock?   Hope you're all doing well.

Hey,  just heard from the girls that you are now a tv star.  They saw you on some E! Entertainment special.  I am sorry to say that I missed it!  How are you and where are you?  I am assuming that you have now left the boat and are wondering your way to Austrailia.  Hope you are enjoying yourself.  I just spent the weekend in Memphis - visiting family and friends.  It was a lot of fun!

If the show runs again and I am able to see it, perhaps I will record it for you!  Have fun and keep in touch!

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

we should get financials from Knauf friday morning in the over night mail - I will keep you posted.  I think we can get this deal.  Also, we are three more deals and $100,000 closer to Pebble Beach - I sold gas to Palo Alto yesterday.

Hi Joan - yes it is me, your long lost cousin!  You probobly got my address off of something that my mom sent around.  How are things with you?  As you probobly knew, I am back in Houston - which is very good as my company just announced a merger on Friday.  Worried about many of my friends but I am not so worried about loosing my job.  The world is certainly in turmoil!  Hope all is well with you and your family.  Keep in touch -

Kim

I know that Kim Ward is a common name, but as I was  scanning the addresses of mail forwarded to me, your name was on the list.   Are you the Kim Ward native of Memphis and  daughter of Jerry? If so, this is Joan-reply.  If not, trash  this.

Palo Alto asked me to refax the confirms that we recently sent because they had problems with their fax machine.  Also, do we need to have them sign the confirms and send them back to us?  If so, I need to l let them know.

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for 
gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call 
options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call

Dan, 

El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.

Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help.

Kim

Steve,

It appears as though the outside council opinion is no longer keeping us from completing the ISDA.  If you guys are ok with the current language, we can send you an executable copy and you guys can sign and send back with all of the documents that are required according to the ISDA.  We are prepared to provide you with our documents and will send them with the executable copies of the ISDA.

Call me when you get a chance and let me know what your status is.  I think Barry and I will be in So. California the 17th and 18th.  If you have some time, we would like to stop by and see you guys.  Just let me know when you are available. 

Thanks,

Kim

what kind of breakdown?  when did I ever have a breakdown?  A mini mid-life crisis maybe (hence the belly ring).  Nothing new - stayed in town this weekend and had a fun relaxing time.  Theresa just called and wanted to know if I was going to COGA.  I had to break the bad news!  When Lisa and her current boyfriend break up - (gerald met him too) I will let you know!

So what is going on the weekend Barry is making us go up to Denver?  Should I come in on Sat - since I can't go to NYC for the US open!!

You may not believe in this but the advice is great!
Read all the way down, you might learn something
THE FOLLOWING IS A CHINESE GOOD LUCK TANTRA TOTEM.

This tantra totem has been sent to you for good luck. It has been sent
around the world ten times so far. You will receive good luck within four
days of relaying this tantra totem.

Send copies to people you think need good luck. Don't send money as fate
has no price.

Do not keep this message. The tantra totem must leave your hands in 96
hours. You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is true, even if you are
not superstitious.

ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.

TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their
conversational skills will be as important as any other.

THREE. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you
want.

FOUR. When you say, "I love you," mean it.

FIVE. When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.

SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married.

SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight.

EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't
have much.

NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only
way to live life completely.

TEN. In disagreements, fight fairly. Please No name-calling.

ELEVEN. Don't judge people by their relatives.

TWELVE.   Talk slowly but think quickly.

THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile
and ask, "Why do you want to know?"

FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great
risk.

FIFTEEN. Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.

SIXTEEN. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others;
Responsibility for all your actions.

EIGHTEEN. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.

NINETEEN. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to
correct it.

TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your
voice.

TWENTY-ONE. Spend some time alone.

Now, here's the FUN part!  ["FUN"!!?!!]

David,

I got a phone call from Summit energy, through whom I supply full requirements gas to Smurfit Stone Container Corporations plants in southern California.  Smurfit has a couple of plants in El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Union System, that Summit is looking to obtian bids for.  The contact at Summit is Jason Ramsey and his number is 502-429-3800.  Their load is about 100,000 MMBtu annually.  Is there someone at EES that would be interested in working on this transaction?  Let me know if EES is not interested and I will let Jason know.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Lyndon,

I finally got my CDs back yesterday and I was so happy!  Thanks again for making sure that they were sent to Miami.  How are you?  Where are you?  where have you been?  Since I have to sit in this office everyday staring at a computer screen, I must live vicariously through people like you!  I'm actually not traveling until mid september.  I go to Denver on sept. 8 - 10 and then to Southern California the following week.  October brings Arizona, Aruba, and perhaps northern california.  Looking forward to Aruba - don't really care about the rest since they are work!!  Anyway - hope all is well with you and that you are enjoying yourself - wherever you might be!

Take care,

K2

Stacy,

I just extended a deal with the City of Pasadena for September.  The previous deal was for April thru August and the confirm was prepared by Dan Hyvl.  Could you help me prepare the confirm for the extension?  The term sheet is attached as there are minor changes.  Please let me know if you have any questions or if you are unable to work on this for me.

Thanks,

Kim

Sean,

I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is "assuring me" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Jane,

The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.

thanks,

Kim

Subject:	RE:

Mara;

I am wondering why the basis shown on the indicatives is much higher than
basis shown on Enron Online?  For example, basis to PG&E citygate on
EnronOnline is about $0.88 for Nov01-Mar02 and $0.78 for Nov02-Mar03, but
the indicative shows about $1.18 and $0.92 respectively.  Are these
different products?  Is the difference attributable to the indicatives being
for physical products?  Just trying to learn something.

Jane.

New VERY IMPORTANT deal.  I promised parent guarantee requirements and credit and collateral term probobly in the form of an Enfolio by Thursday.  This is a power generator that we do services for in Portland.  Tracy is very familiar with this company and has reviewed their credit.  She should have all the infor you need.  If not let me know.

customer:  Wheelabrator, a subsidiary of Waste Management.  

They need gas for their Lassen, California plant and HAVE to close something by next week.  I am showing them a basic structure with a baseload volume with swings being priced at gas daily.  9,000/day baseload @ Malin.  Today the fixed price is about $4.10

Is there anyway to get this done?  Please let me know so that i can pursue.  Also, can we do physical gas deals under the EEI?  We have an EEI with them.

THANKS,

Kim

Megan,

Mara has been terminated so I looked in our files and found a spreadsheet for November.  However, it doesn't have the volumes filled in. Shannon Groenewald should be able to provide you with the actual volumes and all you should have to do is add them to this spreadsheet.  I have copied Shannon on this email so she should expect to hear from you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Hi David,

I got your name from Don Black as the replacement for Roger Ponce.  I am on the West Gas Origination desk for ENA in Houston and often run across customers looking for gas supply, particularly in California, that would be considered retail customers.  I am forwarding a request I received this morning that EES might be interested in.  I will continue to forward such information to you unless you let me know you are not the person I should be contacting.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim -

You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now.  Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them.  As you know, this is not a quick endeavor.

I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though.  Do you have updated financial info from them?

Jack,

Attached is a graph showing storage year by year.  We are expecting another rather large injection this week.  Cal 02 Nymex is up about $.0125 but the balance of 01 is down about a penny.  There is no weather to speak of and therefore,  no demand for physical gas - this is what is driving prices down.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Am still working on the option pricing.

Thanks,

Kim

The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.

Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

Kim

You seem to be up on current affairs associated with power.

 

Reference to the power crisis in California, did the whacko environmentalist have anything to do with it???  I am hearing that California has not built any power plants in the last 10 years due to environmentalist putting on too many restrictions.

 

One other question about the environmentalist trying to get rid of the hydroelectric dams in Washington State, will this lead to more power problems for California if they accomplish their goal?

 

Let me know? jp

guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable
to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day

Hello again, 

Now that air travel is somewhat back to normal, Barry and I are rescheduling our trip to Southern California.  It is my understanding that the ISDA itself has been executed and required attachments are in the process of being gathered.  Therefore, you will soon have the option of transacting with Enron financially.   We are available to meet with you at any time on October 11th.  Please let me know if and when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

Again, we look forward to meeting with you and exploring new opportunities.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

No, we need to change the price to be confirmed at a weighted average price of $3.90.  I put this on  the deal sheet.  Don't know if they noted it in the system.  Please change and let me review again.

Thanks,

Steve,

Attached are two copies of the revised ISDA - one is redlined and one is not.  If you are ready for an executable copy, please let me know and I will have them printed out and sent to you.  Sara Shackleton is on vacation this week but Marie Heard is trying to start the process for outside counsil opinion. I will keep you informed as I know more about this.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything at all from me.

Thanks!

Kim

Lou,

Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:
    I appreciate  receiving the pricing updates from you last week for 5 yr. and 3 yr. gas  strips.  Henwood is working for several generation clients doing  gas/electric consulting, so I'll probably be contacting you again for an  indicative price, or you might receive an RFP for gas that we're helping a QF  write.
  
    One question that  I have now is, do you have an idea on what the premium would be for a 5 yr. gas  supply that was 5x13 or 5x16 rather than a base-load 7x24 at the PG&E  Citygate?   Thanks, Kim.

Darla,

I did run across some missing NSP deals for June and July and some price mismatches for a couple of NSP deals for July.  

For June, 3000/day priced at $4.70 and fior July. 3,100/day priced at $4.79.  Also, I am resending you July and the Yellow highlights show the two deals that I don't agree with the price.

Call me with quesitons

Thanks,

Kim

Attached is the new contracts by which Los Angeles Department of Water and Power intends on entering into natural gas purchases and sales.  Is there any hope of getting in on some of this action?  Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Contract.doc)

Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems.  All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have.  I have no idea what flows.  I hope Patti can help you soon.  Let me know if you don't hear from her today.

If I can get all of the information today, I can tell you this afternoon.  It doesn't take long to create the calc sheets.  I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need.  If necessary, I can come pick it up.  I have sent Patti a list.

For payment, we have to forecast the money two days out.  So, if I know today, I can pay on Friday.

Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?  And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?

Thanks,

Kim

I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62.  I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her.  Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August?  Again, I do not have all of the information for July and August, so I cannot give you any numbers.  If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil.  I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do.

FYI-I will be out of the office all next week.

I know - I am so inconsiderate!  But, if you want, I will promise NEVER to do it again.  

Just a little tired today- thanks goodness for the opportunity to sleep late yesterday.  How about yourself?

I usually get here between 7:30 and 8.  Today - exactly 8 o'clock!  Not much going on in the market today - I might finally go get my car tags and driver's license - but I've been saying that for 5 months now!

Hello.  sorry I missed you last night ( and Saturday night!)  That football game I watched had 7 (a record) Overtimes!  The game lasted until about 10:30 and my team lost.  Very sad.  JDA and I went to Berryhill to meet Matt last night and I thought you would be there.  Is everything OK with you?  

K.

I am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa Clara, also known as Silicon Valley Power.  We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.  Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda? 

Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Thanks,

Kim

Jay, 

A couple of weeks ago I asked you to review the City of Las Cruces and let me know if we have an enfolio or if we have sent them a draft.  Could you let me know where we stand with that?  I need to respond to them by Monday, the 8th.

thanks,

Kim

PS  Also, I know you sent Debra a request for an Enfolio for IID but I never received a copy.  Did you?

Dan,

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti=
ces.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  =
The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or=
der.

=09I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order,=
 please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signatur=
e by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available=
 to handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of i=
ncumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a=
 fully executed contract for your files.
=09Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers =
of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  =
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your=
 transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for gi=
ving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for i=
ts actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if=
 Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto an=
d Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notific=
ation, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.=
  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their r=
eceipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes. =
   I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  the OF=
O provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I can=
 verify with the transport group.

I am assuming you're looking at the "daily" tab.  The first column reflects
actual usage.  The second column is a 30 day rolling average.

Could I get price indications from you today for a customer of ours.  Their
load is pretty small, ~ 200 MMBtu/day.  I need monthly prices at Malin and
Citygate starting July 2001 through June 2003.

Thanks,

Monica

Monica,

What is the difference in the volumes in the first column and those in the
second column?  I am working on this today and must discuss with the desk -
who will be managing the extra risk.  I hope to have something back to you
by tomarrow.

   Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our
   potential
   natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and
   would
   like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.

   As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid
   daily
   price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing
   market
   warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in
   the
   form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
   constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years
   of
   daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information
   when
   submitting your final proposal.

   Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.

   Regards,

   Monica V. Padilla

Mike,

We still haven't heard from Dave - he may be wondering who Jason Williams from Enron is.  If you guys could work him from you end, it could speed things up.

Thanks for your help,

How Enron Blew It

Texas Monthly

November 2001

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p=
hp>

THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

=20

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20

You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.

"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.

"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."  <outbind://13/Image2.gif>

Subject:	NOAA Update for Winter Outlook

U.S. STILL ON TRACK FOR ANOTHER COOL WINTER
November 15, 2001 - Don't let the recent short-sleeve temperatures fool you: The U.S. remains on track for a repeat of last winter, NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> forecasters said Thursday. In an update to its official winter 2001-02 outlook <http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s794.htm>, NOAA's National Weather Service <http://www.nws.noaa.gov/> said it still expects the coming winter to bring abrupt swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South and the potential for Nor'easters <http://www.noaa.gov/questions/question_010901.html> along the East Coast. (Click NOAA image for larger view of snowfall in Long Island, New York, on March 5, 2001.)
Forecasters said the winter outlook update, which covers December 2001 - February 2002, is missing the influences of either a strong El Ni?o <http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/> or La Ni?a <http://www.elnino.noaa.gov/lanina.html> climate pattern, and paves the way for a winter of weather extremes.
"When neither climate pattern is present, other climate factors can play a significant role in the day-to-day winter weather we experience," said James Laver, acting director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center <http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/>.
Laver said the other climate factors include: the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest.
Regional Outlooks
?	In the Northeast, colder-than-normal temperatures are expected. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation; 
?	The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation; 
?	The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have a slightly enhanced chance of averaging above normal; 
?	In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal; 
?	The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures; 
?	In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely; 
?	Expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation; 
?	Southwestern Alaska can expect a wet winter. The rest of Alaska and all of Hawaii can expect equal chance of above normal, normal, or below normal temperatures and precipitation. 
The 2001-02 winter outlook will be updated on Dec. 13, 2001, at 3 p.m. EST.

Ann & Darla,

I am attaching a spreadsheet that details what should be booked and billed to Citizens under the NEW gas daily call option/transport deal to serve the Griffith plant.  It is somewhat complicated but don't be scared - I will help both of you understand what needs to be done.  Hopefully, we can set up a procedure whereby this deal can be taken care of each month.

I think we should set up a meeting to discuss.  Let me know when you guys are available - hopefully sometime monday.

Thanks,

Kim

Ann,

Can you check on the palo alto confirms for deals that were done around the 20th of July?  I think there are about three confirms they have not received and Karla at Palo Alto is going to get in trouble internally.

thanks,

Jay,

We have been short listed on an rfp for Noresco, a power plant developer.  Attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project.  They plan to refresh prices and perhaps transact this week.  they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.  I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.  I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.  It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.

CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??  PLEASE?  I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!)  

Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!

thanks,

Kim

Guys, has there been any arrangements made for a send off for Phil.... 

We need to get him a card and a wedding gift ( I assume you would agree).

I would also be more than happy to take the group out for lunch 11:30 - 1:00  if people are interested. 

Pls advise.

Art,

We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions -

1)  Is this physical or financial
2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be?

Thanks,

Kim

ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying to work around some meetings etc.

Kim

In addition to reviewing our Q3 gas and power portfolios, we are currently
assessing various new local generation resources.

As part of our assessment, it would be quite helpful to have a relatively
current forward curve for NYMEX gas, CA Border gas, and SP15 electricity.
Could you provide monthly data for 12-18 months and annual data for 5-10
years for forward transactions?
This doesn't necessarily need to be today's curve, as long as it is recent
and the prices are from the same point in time.

Also, please provide current SP15 and Border gas quotes for Q3 and 12-month
strip.

Thanks!

Art,

The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day delivered @ San Juan would be $.48.  For Q3 only, the premium would be $.49.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have questions or need anything else.  I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest.

Thanks,

Kim

We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions - 
1)  Is this physical or financial 
2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call 
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of 
the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be? 
Thanks,

for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
from the San Juan basin?

Attached is our physical firm Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for Natural Gas Transactions.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  Once we get this in place, we will be able to enter into any gas transactions and we won't have to worry about contracts.

What's up with this?  they are looking to lock in 12-16 months of gas prices.  We have been selling to them month to month for 6 months.  Have there been any problems?  Are we going to let them go to Amoco?

Will advise as to any netting benefits we may get regarding gas/power deals with Smurfit.  For now, the gas team does not want to take on any incremental risk with Smurfit from the physical gas perspective.

We can still look at case-by-case physical power deals with EPMI given the collateral that we're holding.

Tracy,
	Talked to Tanya regarding the long deal for SSCC and relayed to her your suggestion for handling gas.  She is ok with managing both gas and power through EPMI as long as legal is on board and all necessary EPMI docs are in place or amended (netting, physical gas), and that we are comfortable with the receivables risk to SSCC.  She actually mentioned that there has been discussions about merging EPMI and ENA into one entity to more properly handle net positions, so she seems to like your idea.  
	With that, I guess I'll pass this deal and legal relationship onto you unless you need or want me to help with any of this.  

Thanks,
Max

Stacy,

I left you a message but wanted to send you a note too.  I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?

Let me know how things look for you as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kim

Art, 

It looks like I won't be able to make it.  I have some meetings set up that I seem to be unable to re-arrange.  I really appreciate the invite though.  Maybe next time.  However, I am going to try to make it to Albuquerque before the end of the year.  I will let you know what my plans are.

Thanks again for the invitation.  Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.

We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions -

2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call 
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of 
the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be?

Sara,

Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Frank,

I just spoke to Jan Kennedy and they are going out for an RFP for their gas supply once our contract with them runs out.  She "recommended" that I tak e a look at your response to the last RFP because it was so good - far surpassing any of the other responses!!  If you still have a copy or a file of that response, would you mind if I took a look at it? 

thanks,

Kim

Janette,

Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day but have moved back up.

Thanks,

Kim

I'm still holding on by a thin thread here in Portland, but I wanted to send you my vitals as I'm experiencing advanced symptoms of the travel bug. Needless to say, you're one of the major reasons I have no regrets about having worked at Enron. Definitely stay in touch.

Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

Kelli,

While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.

I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.

thanks,
Kim

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for 
gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call 
options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call 
option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

check out the following websites for airfare:

www.orbitz.com - the best so far.  
www.cheaptickets.com
www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer

register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform

Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.  Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.  Don't forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter)

p.s.  If you want to see how UN attractive my friends are - we are going to be a the wine bucket (new place - W. Alabama just east of Kirby) at 6 pm tonight.  Suzanne, Camille, Jeanie, Lori, Elizabeth.  You can check Camille out for yourself.  Bring others along.

It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume.

Can you please check and get back to John?

Chris,

Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there
are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send
SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the
delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon
is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the
additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon
received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due.

It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the
volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In
any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's
review.

Best regards,
John Ewing

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hi Steve,

Just wanted to update the status with the ISDA.  I believe that you have received a copy of the new draft with all of the changes that we've agreed to.  If you guys approve of this draft, we can have an executable copy drawn up and sent to you.  As for the outside council opinion, Sara Shackleton is out of the office until next tuesday and her assistant doesn't know how to proceed with this process.  We will have to wait for Sara's return in order to facilitate that process.  I have sent her an email so that we can get started right away.

Let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or if you have any questions.  I do hope you are able to enjoy the long weekend!

Thanks,

Kim

Suz,

I say lets do it! and so does Terri.  I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.  I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!  Keep me posted on how your day is going.  I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.  

K.

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Terri,

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the
TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit -
but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -
thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim

Or did you just sail around since you lived down there?  I've gotten my pictures back but I am waiting to see pictures from the other people that went.  I was using diposable cameras since mine was broken.  I was so disappointed that I went out and bought a new one the minute I got back!

I left Thursday for a wedding in Green Bay, and then Sunday the bride and groom and a bunch of others, went up to the bride's family cabin up in Northern Wisconsin.  It was great.  We canoed, fished, drank a lot of beer and listened to awesome guitarists jam around the campfire.    Got back at 11:30 last night.

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you will be unable to attend. Thanks.

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to
admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never
able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the
invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that
would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.
I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you
could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Kim 2

That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

BTW, Tom drove from 12th to 6th in his race.   Very impressive.  Also, Kramer told me yesterday that the SCCA tow fund is paying us $600 each.  Yeah!  It goes to the top 3 guys that go and there were only 3 guys from our region!  Also, did you know Jimmy won close to 10k for getting 2nd?  Spicer (winner) got something like 13k in cash and trinkets.

Cool!

Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -

We could meet at my house and sit on my patio.  I should stick around until 5:30 or so.  I could be home by 5:45 or 6.  Is that cool?

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Ellen,

Palo Alto is telling me that they need Enron signatures on all of the confirms that we sent them last week.  If you could print out copies and have them sent to me, I can get Barry to sign them and overnight them to Palo.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris,

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

Kim Ward

Jeff,

Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January, 2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you need -

Thanks,

Kim

Hey Lyndon!  Very glad to finally hear from you.  Sounds like you are happy=
 back in Austrailia!  I would love to see it sometime.  Unless things chang=
e between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on Janu=
ary 6th.  We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. Ma=
rtin look fabulous.  We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before w=
e get on the boat.  I hope you are there.  Although I would understand if y=
ou stayed where you are!  Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay i=
n Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.

As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really clo=
se to me was killed.  I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night, just =
in time not to get stuck there.  One of my very good friends was suppose to=
 be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was ca=
lled back to Houston for a meeting tuesday.  Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 =
am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had=
 that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him=
.  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is ve=
ry sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are=
 doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make =
me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that th=
is thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most =
things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freed=
om were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in=
 and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be d=
one to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away =
to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that a=
ttitude! =20

Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing th=
e same - just here in ugly Houston for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba =
for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of=
 the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go=
 back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!

Take care,

Love, K2

To my lovely K2,

Sorry I haven't written in a while but life has been
passing by so fast that I rarely know what day it is.
I hope that you and any friends or family were not
hurt in any of the attacks on the USA. It's just
unbelievable that someone could hold so much hatred
for others that they would do these things. It's
beyond my realm of understanding.
I hope life is treating you well and you are safe.
As for me I am back a home and trying to decide
whether or not to leave and go back to work. I am
supposed to go back to the poly on the 7th Oct but
don't really want to leave home. It's so beautiful
here, and I am a little worried about the next war
that is going to happen. Worried for all hatred and
sadness that it is going to cause. Its really got me
thinking about living more in the present rather than
planning ahead, not that I have had much forethought
to begin with but something to think about.
I have some photos for you that should be attached to
this email.
Again I hope you are well and still loving this life.

Take Care

Love Lyndon

Jason is available at 3:30 and I agree we should get together before - do you want Jason involved?  We could meet at 3:30 and bring Hesco in at 4:00.  Let me know your thoughts.

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Hey Kim!! I wish I could join you guys in January too!!! I definitely would
if I wasn't going in December!! I've had trouble adjusting to the "real
world" too. My productivity is quite low...to say the least!! Anyway, I can
send you a new invitation. I just need to know which e-mail address you want
me to send it to. Just let me know and I'll send it right out!! Take care
and keep in touch! Linda

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to
admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never
able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the
invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that
would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.
I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you
could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Kim 2

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet describing our proposal for September.  The changes are highlighted in yellow.  One of the things you guys might be interested in looking at long term is extending the current fixed price deals that you have and blending the price.  Another is a peaking option or cap.  We can talk about these things on the phone.
Give me a call when you have a chance to review the term sheet and let me know what you guys want to do.

Thanks,

Kim

I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.  Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  Don't know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?  I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.  Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?  or just my drinking goggles?

I have revised the spreadsheet I have been sending you with the fixed prices for the citizens deal.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to see additional enhancements.  As deals are done, I will continue to update this spreadsheet.

Houston has actually been nice - hasn't gone above 85 and it is great to sit outside at night.  Anyway, you work too much and need to think about getting a life!!  

We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.

I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  

Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!

Take care,

Kim

with them. Honestly, I'd rather be sweating in Houston and be at your party.

Did you make it to Greasewood Flats?

Art,

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Attached is a little presentation detailing our proposal for some El Paso capacity that I previously mentioned to you.  Once you have a chance to look it over, give me a call and we can discuss your interests, what would make the proposal more attractive for Santa Clara, and any questions that you might have.

Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan, and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about $.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.  The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the people gate code is c1984.  

See you then -

Kim

We could meet at my house and sit on my patio.  I should stick around until
5:30 or so.  I could be home by 5:45 or 6.  Is that cool?

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Chino plant 100% down = 80 MW
Bagdad plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw
Cerrito plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw

Basically 120 -150 MW offline due to PDs decrease in producion.  the same percentage decrease in gas demand is what we should see.  Let me know if you would like us to investigate this further.

Thanks,

Kim

Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches! 

Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.

K.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.  I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Most things here look good.  From my term sheet, page 1 under El Paso Capacity, what about selling them San Juan gas?  (B.)  And what about page three, number 8?  Let me know -

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about.  The market it down today so they may appear to be a little high.  I am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed.  Please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs.

I would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together.  In order to do so, we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an ISDA master swap agreement in place.  One thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be in touch with the transport structure.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!

Thanks, 

Kim

Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful.

I have spoken to Stacy Dickson about what needs to happen with the whole "Australian parent/US subsidiary" guaranty issue.  I haven't heard back yet.

Attached is the BHP Copper master physical.  It's in PDF format, so they'll need Adobe Acrobat to view.

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Scotty,

Long time - no email.  How are you?  As you know, things aren't so good here.  It is so sad!!!  Anyway, just wanted to put another bug in your ear - I'm still pro Atlanta.  If you know of anything going on at Mirant that would be a fit for me - please let me know.  West gas or power, origination or trading.  Give me a call sometime - I don't know how long I will be at this desk but my number here is 713-853-0685.  My cell is 713-412-4571.  That shouldn't change.  My email address at home is kward1@houston.rr.com.

I do hope all is well with you - and that you keep in touch no matter what!

Take care,

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

I have added Socal to the worksheet.  The prices listed are as of last night.  Nymex is up $.04 - $.05.  Basis is pretty much the same.  Let me know if you need anything else and I will let you guys know as soon as I get the option information.

Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have
attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan,
and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are
pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru
March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about
$.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.
The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell
significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you
the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some
reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim

Chris, 

If you have a minute, will you look at this term sheet?  His volumes are really small but if we get the Palo Alto deal it won't be that big of a deal - unless we have to schedule less than 1 MMBtu. Oh yo!  His average daily volume, for both plants is about 178/day, based on annual usage.  I have proposed basically a GD deal with a first of the month index option if he can set a BDQ.

Thanks in advance.

Kim

Kelli,

While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.

I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.

thanks,
Kim

Hey Lyndon,

It was nice to hear from you.  We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!  Things here have been changing by the day.  To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that Kim 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!

How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -

Kim

Life has been very busy back here on the poly. We have
just come out of wetdock and the ship is a mess but
will be awesome by the time you get here. Our first
cruise this week is a gay cruise, very strange!!!!!
Its not really my type of cruise. Seeing 2 guys
cuddling each other sleeping on the deck is a bit much
for me. I dont dislike it, its just I dont understand
it. Women are such beautiful creatures, why !!!
Anyway yes I will more than likely be here when you
get here, unless I get sacked or quit, but more than
likely I will be here.

Take Care
See you soon
Love Lyndon

Rob, 

I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.  

I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac!

Kim, 

How's the hiring climate over in Barry's world?  The future here in broadband obviously is bleak.  I'm trying to generate job leads at a company that is quickly shrinking.  Not an enviable position.  

Attached is a resume.  Any inquiries on my behalf are appreciated. As for added comments to hiring people: although I've spent my entire 2 1/2 year Enron career at EBS, I've been in trading, structuring, and origination roles the entire time. I can model and sell w/ the best of them.  I also know Jean Mrha and Tom Gros well. (If that's worth anything.)

Any help is much appreciated. 

Thanks

-Rob

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will

Thanks

FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Sure you can stay at my house!  I will try to join you Thursday nite as well.  Things have been pretty shitty lately - with work, with the love life, and a huge sinus infection.  Hopefully things will be looking up by then!  Please make yourself at home!  You can come and go as you need.

some more beers and watch fireworks from downtown, Astroworld and everywher=
e else.  After that, anything can happen.

Come on over anytime after 5pm.  Bring friends, family and beer if you like=
, as well as beach chairs, footballs and frisbees (rooftop fun).  Kids are =
welcome.

Please let me know if you think you are coming so we do not radically under=

Terri, 

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.  Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim:

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.

Hey,  did you call me this morning?  Sorry I missed it if you did.  Been running around like crazy - currently missing presentations trying to close a small (very!) deal.  If I don't talk to you, good luck with your pitch to your customer!  I hope you get the deal!

Talk to you later,

Kim

Gentlemen,

  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination

Hi guys,

Attached is the swap picture we discussed.  I am working on some call prices as well and will send them asap.  Prices fell significantly today - probobly $.20 going one year out at the PG&E City gate.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Suzanne had previous plans so I thought that I didn't confirm the reservation.  I will be in the Grenadine Islands on the 14th - what's the occasion?  I think we will try to come in August some time.  Will that be OK?

Art, 

Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  Barry and I have discussed San Juan risks but we are willing to take it - however, the actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the Blanco Pool.  When you are ready to transact, I will update the exact price at that time.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,

Kim

Thanks Mike, we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,

Kim
