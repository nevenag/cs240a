flourish  I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now---sch Is Enron the New Drexel By Michael Lewis the author of Liars Poker and The New New Thing Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg -- Enron Corp is rapidly expanding the American business journalists notion of what is possible No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true The boss Kenneth Lay was a friend of the current president of these United States an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers The company itself was rated strong buy by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms and plugged endlessly by the business press Six years running as Fortunes most innovative company And all the while this same operation was at the very top a lie Understandably people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation but really there isnt a good one Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management Michael Milkens junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay Alumni Will Flourish True in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them And in both cases the core business -- Drexels junk bonds and Enrons energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didnt go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc and Duke Energy Corp Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell the energy trading business will return to normal But the morality of the cases are entirely different Whatever you think of Milkens junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones He paid himself huge sums of money but he also made huge sums for his firm He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him and they loved him for it The Enron bosses by contrast pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was Milken created an operation which was if anything much more profitable than it looked What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses This is something I still dont understand and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines Indian power plants and the like Why did Enron which made its money as an intermediary invest in this stuff in the first place The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel In Drexels case it took a multiyear investigation by the US government together with a smear campaign in the press to bring down the business In Enrons case all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out among other things that senior executives were profiting at the companys expense In Drexels case the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story In Enrons the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top Anything is possible Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg -- Enron Corp is

mailtoJhadams69aolcom Sent Monday October 08 2001 836 PM To Williams III Bill Subject Homework Hi Bill -I read through the stuff you gave me and I do have a few questions First did you get my resume and letter and did they download OK  I am looking forward to the interview and assuming I do well am anxious to get started  So let me know about a timeline when you can please What kind of affect will a west-wide RTO have on Enron  I saw in a couple of the newsletters that FERC is pushing hard for it  -A west wide RTO is very good for Enron as it would facilitate moving energy around the grid and contribute to marketing efficiency Wood also proposes FERC initiate a rulemaking on market design and structure to translate the eight RTO functions in Order No 2000 into concrete protocols for the RTO organizations  Is there anywhere I can find out what the 8 RTO functions are  You should be able to find more information regarding RTOs on the nerc and ferc websites national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision A lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost  Do you do any trading in gas  We do not trade gas on real-time but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side Canada -- New Alberta Power Plant  Do you move any Canadian electricity  We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently though we do not schedule the energy into Canada We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border The CPUC has suspended direct access switches  What kind of impact does this have on trading  How does Californias Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA  This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here Northwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted 500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices  A judge said they were just and fair  Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor  Yes it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades In short its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW Enron and PGE There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN  Will this have any effect on you  To put it bluntly will you still be able to hire from the outside  Will the sale do anything to the 100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron   The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price How close are we to having BPAs transmission system under FERC jurisdiction  What does Enron think of that or do they care Dynegy Exelon Entergy Cinergy -- who are these guys    Dynegy and Exelon are power companies like Enron-Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon Exelon said  it would reduce its  2001 estimates due to power market volatility and  it would cut an additional 450 positions   Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market or did Exelon just do a shitty job  That would be the latter SoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money  What happens if it goes bankrupt  How does that affect Enron overall and would it change the daily trading process  -Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is I believe it is minimal on the trading desk Tell me about Qualifying Facility QF suppliers This will take a while How will green power enter into your mix  It doesnt yet Green power just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good Cal-ISOs director of grid planning  testified that the cost  of 1500 MW of new capacity is justified as a way to prevent power sellers market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production  Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CAs energy crisis  As California creates new capacity will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do or will they just have more power to deal with A long or short market is just a part of trading For example the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have All for now  Thanks for the information The acronyms are incredible  It was like these things were written in a foreign language  Looking forward to hearing from you   The acronyms are incredible but they all make sense after a while John

enjoy NewportMy friend lives down there in Huntington Beach watch out for him he moved down there about 3 months ago  I have been planning on visiting him for a while  I wouldnt mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down  Last time I was in LA I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home  Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--Steven Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end the guy was NOT good--which was nice  Also one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show I think  So I definitely need to go down there for a visit  I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July 16th thru 18th and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off  So whatever if I make it down there it should be a decent time Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland hope you can make it though the deck seems stacked against you this time around  I will plan for you to be here so you wouldnt be stuck in a hotel but dont worry if you cant get here on the 3rd  Plenty of time for that as the sun should be out for a while til October anyway I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday get a few runs in before 10 but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt St Helens on my bike instead  Its supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you cant pass such weekends up  St Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains  Well see though either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains So work was solid today got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to  No one brought me lunch after working the night shiftbut what can you do Anyway hope the funeral goes well you knowas it can and keep me posted on whenif you might get up to Portland  Oh  And as for a picture Ill see what I can do  Brendans got a couple but I dont have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you  I admit I have been called an Ogre before I am a bit of a taller bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it butwellBrendan should be able to fill you in  Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture Enjoy your time in LA And take care Bill -----Original Message-----From 	nikki cole -nikoleexcitecomENRON

sorry I couldnt write you yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients  But Im writing you now  I just pray that I wont get too busy today  That probably wont work all that well since Im here and not at church where I should be  Catholics are funny about that stuff  Yep  Im the good little Catholic girl  My moms a first grade Catholic private school teacher my dad used to teach CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and confeesion on Saturdays  It doent always work out so well if you know what I mean  I took a Sunday shift today didnt I Anyhow the POrtland trip  Let me share with you the dilemma  Ok I set aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation  That money is currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral in LA  Also my family members the son of the one who died was coming up to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive restraunts etc  So that probably wont happen  But basically its the first reason  I dont know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane ticket plus any other details food funeral flowersgifts etc and still get to go to Portland Plus Im moving in a month so Im going to have moving expenses as well Ughhh  I want to go soooo bad But things all happen for a reason  It looks like I may not be able to go but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket Aprox 3 hours later Well I just got off the phone with you so you actually know all about the about issues above  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour  WOW I dont think I can send my picture on this computer  Ill try but it may not work  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think Im an ogre is that spelled right  I tell you what Ill send you one if you send me one  Deal  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the other person looks like that you are talking to  Then again some people look better in pictures than in real life  Im not fortunate enough to be one of those Geez we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I dont really have anything to say  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to reference this  Oh well saved by the bella co-worker of mine has just bought me lunch He really is a sweet guy  Im not sure but I think hes a little slow Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do the filing and patient transport for me  He is such a nice guy  then today he knows Im moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in to bring me lunch  Awwwh  I am going to miss alot of people out here You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit  Any ideas when that might be  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you that oyu have extended to me  If you are in my vicinity you are more than welcome to stay with me and Ill show you around  Unless of course you are coming out soon then it would be more like ok we are two lost tourist I would love to see alot of the LA things  Sunset BLVD Universal Studios all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area  I hear they are fabulous  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around Ill be well versed in the places to be  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the Wishire Regency Hotel  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet  Complete with chocolate covered strawberries  Yummm Oh I am a fanatic about desserts I better not keeping Lee waiting  Hes figitty  Talk to you soon Nikki Send a cool gift with your E-Card httpwwwbluemountaincomgiftcenter

devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias power-buying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer ChaosInexperience Hobbled Power Buyers State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L RABIN Times Staff Writers August 12 2001 It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis when Californias first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening trying to figure how to keep the lights on when a speeding tractor-trailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising said Ray Hart head of the energy planning team The symbolism was not lost on him The next day with the states electricity supply on the line and the governors political career on the blink Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West purchasing electricity for 10 million customers whose utilities were going broke Now seven months and billions of dollars later the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry Even Gov Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch Its like the Yankees playing a stickball team he said in a recent interview Were totally out of our league The administrations new long-term contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future Making matters worse nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companies--a fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements Five were hastily fired and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations How an agency could forget conflict-of-interest codes or ignore them is beyond me said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica This is the way people lose faith in government Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in including one from Davis Republican political rival Secretary of State Bill Jones Amid all the controversy of recent days Hart said the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed Frankly said Hart a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources its kind of disconcerting we arent getting the credit we should be getting Patching Together a Team on the Fly The states new energy-buying organization was a beg borrow and recruit operation A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project The agency received an immediate infusion of 22 million to create its expanded trading arm of 88 employees and consultants On the fly Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas  Electric Southern California Edison and the energy industry Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand From the start the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day a state budget document said It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively Professionals in this business are highly compensated Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February They said Can you be up here Tuesday  said Mead a 55-year-old former Edison engineer from Duarte I said For a job interview And they said No bring enough stuff for several months  They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume Mead said He worked six weeks he said before he finally got a contract to sign In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage 2 on the verge of blackouts he said There was no focus other than to keep the lights on One day Mead said he bought 10 of all power consumed on the states electricity grid during his 12-hour shift But unlike Mead most of the new crew had never bought power before according to their resumes Most worked at the now-defunct California Power Exchange an energy trading floor similar to a stock market reconciling sales and purchases made by others Before that one worked at a freight-forwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group Theyre just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast said Mark Palmer spokesman for Houston-based Enron Corp one of the nations largest energy marketers Its like someone who flies a kite one day and then is told to go fly a 747 the next One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings You dont just come out to someone and say Whats your price and then pay it But thats what some of them have done A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them Palmer said California for the salaries its paying could have done better A particular lightning rod for criticism is the 480000 two-year contract of chief trader Susan T Lee 30 who was hired in April for 120 an hour With barely a years experience in the energy industry she leads a 16-person crew that buys electricity the day before its needed or for nearly immediate use State records show that Lee was paid more than 30000 a month including overtime as she began her new duties That ladys got one years experience and shes getting 500 grand Palmer said An experienced trader in private industry he said might make 80000 to 120000 in a good year plus bonuses Shes certainly making double what I am but shes worth it said Hart who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the once-obscure Department of Water Resources Although Lee could not be reached for comment Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of todays evolving trading market California energy deregulation began only in 1996 and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year he said I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody regardless of experience Lees team members meanwhile have been signed to lucrative short-term contracts worth a maximum of 15000 to 21000 a month including housing rental cars per diem pay and flights home on days off State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didnt think they were qualified Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete They know more than me theyve seen it all said state trader Bernard Barretto a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in 1998 In their own defense the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost Our job was to buy whatever we could buy former trader Elaine Griffin said California was truly a captive market Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higher-ups Do the traders go out and start the deal Yes Hart said Do they cut the final deal No Far from the trading trenches the governor sees things differently The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources he said These are very sophisticated operations Davis said They have several meteorologists and banks of media people To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias power-buying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills Some traders however saw through the guise The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tip-off that California had weighed in I knew it and Im pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it too said one trader who like others asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state But it worked for a while It helped keep the short-term prices down Controversy Over Stock Holdings The state traders were powerless however to protect themselves Just as they were settling into their new jobs and energy prices were falling the administration was stung by the disclosures that 11 of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firm--San Jose-based Calpine Corp--in which they had owned stock The highest-ranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira who was hired on a 500000 contract in January to negotiate long-term power contracts The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng Elaine Griffin who had resigned just days before the firings also held Calpine stock while trading for the state Most of the traders who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares Mead said traders on his state team--such as Cheng Leung and Louie--had no ability to influence Calpines stock price because their purchases of the companys electricity were infrequent and small Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because hed made so much money on it He said his investments of 20000 in 1999 and 134000 last fall brought him about 400000 when he was ordered to sell last month You want to know how I picked Calpine he said Investors Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his 2000 worth of shares on Jan 22 while still at the Power Exchange which had a conflict-of-interest policy barring ownership of energy stock I didnt know I would have an opportunity like this at the time Leung said of his briefly held state job I bought it just because Im interested in the market all the time I follow it Today shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings The big boys the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention Mead said Theyre the ones who knew how things worked Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story For information about reprinting this article go to httpwwwlatscomrightsregisterhtm

Novosel Sarah Subject	RE California ISO Market Re-Design 2002 MD02 All A more detailed version  of CAISOs MD02 proposal was released on Wednesday  Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SCs to go short or long in the RT market ie final schedules do not need to be balanced  Thats good I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement ACAP akin to ICAP will affect our trading GAC What is CAISO proposing First off there are target price and intra-zonal congestion management FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC  The comprehensive package would build off that In essencence CAISO is proposing a capacity market similar to what IEP proposed at the CPUC Procurement OIR that has an available capacity obligation ACAP on the load-serving entities LSEs aka the utilities and electric service providers  This is the solution to the all spot all the time design that was associated with the CPUCs mandatory buysell requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the utilities  The LSEs would be required to show  specify to CAISO the ACAP resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least 115 of the coming months peak demand  ACAP resources can be the LSEs own generation generation under contract etc  Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would lead to penalties  Also CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would penalize the supplier for failure to be available operate as dispatched etc  That wrinkle seems like it calls for 3 party contracts or some element of complexity that shouldnt necessarily be required  Its not clear from the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to other SCs particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity but CAISOs running it to cover someone elses short energy schedule It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix there seems to be a contradictory statement in the paper  However CAISO is proposing a two-year transition mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP resources based on their stellar creditworthiness or DWR resources There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding Also it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the terms of AB 1x CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism similar to the PJM type of design  It is based on a 3000 bus network model with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas  Dispatch will be on an optimized basis that on resource constraints that appears to be dynamic including transmission capacity changes increased ATC when ETC rights are freed up etc and generation availability  There will be some degree of node aggregation in the form of demand locations and trading hubs  It appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach although that is not completely clear Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization effectively removes the need for the balanced schedule requirement  Under the proposal CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets CAISO calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market FERC has called for that  CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO but that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help shape resource needs CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not already scheduled by the LSE  They speak in terms of a residual unit commitment requirement  something akin to the long lead time proposal under the must-offer requirement  Their start and min load payment proposal would be continued subject to loosing it for unavailability or participation in the market Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to locational market power particularly in relation to congestion  I thought that locational market power was addressed via RMR  This raises the black box issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the problem so were mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy pricing mechanism  To some extent in a nodal system CAISO could argue that more folks have locational market power  Well need to review other markets treatment of this issue The future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper and theres the specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if ACAP is put into place  This is probably the largest hole in the paper because theres a clear implication that something should happen and presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue ie kill AS have AS markets but alter products have one AS product but expect low volume etc One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response  In many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market save the extraordinary conservation last summer  There is a suggestion that the ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response but presumably that would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO and those resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side design  While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP and others suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR  Based on a lone comment by a CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday the CPUC is very far behind the curve on these issues and there is absolutely no coordination on this issue  Given that the same solution is popping up in both venues there is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together while avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to coordinate the venues is proposed ABB

Williams III BillSent Items X-Origin WILLIAMS-W3 X-FileName Due to the relatively weak real-time market during morning hours we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buying-back generation that youve sold forward  We want to stress that this is a relatively short-term strategy  As the weather turns cold during the late-Autumn and Winter months the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real-time market Lately HE1-10 have been very weak real-time ranging between 25 and 40  We have two strategies that we would like to suggest Group We have two important items regarding the services and asset management side of our business First The CAISO has been calling repeatedly regarding outages  We will continue to call the CAISO for every outage including when Black Hills goes down 200 kWh  Donna has worked closely with the CAISO regarding their new tariff and her information appears below  It is very important that we do not expose ourselves to charges by not notifying the CAISO of an outage Second We will be working with the generators to execute buy-backs or supplemental dec bids when market conditions warrant  Stan has written an email to the generators also detailed below  Stan and Chris will be contacting the generators over the next few days to review this email with them  Afterwards the Real-Time group will contact the generators and initiate one of the two strategies when profitable  Real-Time will retain 50 of the profits over the generators day ahead profits  Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback Thanks Bill I have reviewed documents from the ISOs website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following 1 During a System Emergency a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage and 2 During a Non-System Emergency a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour If you have any questions at all I can be reached at extension 7733 Thanks Donna 1  Decremental Supplemental Bids We can submit dec bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate  Basically we would be letting the ISO know that were willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mws from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity  You are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it from the ISO  For example if your cost to generate is 40 and you sell day-ahead for 50 you make 10MWh  If the ISO takes the decremental bid and the price is 30 then you make 20MWh Advantages - A relatively large upside the price the ISO charges could actually go negative as large as negative 9187  Also you would actually be buying from the ISO as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk Disadvantages - Ten minute dispatch  When we submit decremental bids the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes  In addition to the physical problems this might create the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow 2  Buying-Back Blocks in the Bi-Lateral Market This strategy calls for our real-time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market for below your cost to generate  This would call for you to reduce your generation and the energy we buy-back in the real-time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity  Once again you are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it at the price paid to buy-back the energy   As in the previous example if your cost to generate is 40 and you sell day-ahead for 50 you make 10MWh  If we can buy-back the energy for a price of 30 then you make 20MWh   Additionally if we do buy-back the energy we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order  Then if the ISO takes the incremental bid you can generate the power and sell for additional profit Advantages - No 10 minute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced  Also the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage Disadvantage - Not as large of an up-side as decremental bidding At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy 2 buying-back blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market  Once you and our real-time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO  We propose a 5050 profit split above your day-ahead profit earned from either of these two strategies If you have any questions or comments please call myself or Chris Foster Stan Cocke

with an ax to grind These guys filed a bunch of complaints against Sempra too back when Sempra owned the plant---sch Dukes Calif Whistleblowers Have History Of Grievances  Updated Wednesday June 27 2001 0736 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones--Three former employees who last week told California lawmakers Duke Energy DUK investmentsquotessymbolDUK news investmentsnewssymbolDUK msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolDUK ramped down its South Bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination the men told Dow Jones Newswires Most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plants previous owner Sempra Energy SRE investmentsquotessymbolSRE news investmentsnewssymbolSRE msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolSRE unit San Diego Gas  Electric for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Dukes profit-centered management style in the deregulated market Duke has called the employees allegations about its operating procedures baseless Duke has said the employees have an ax to grind because they werent hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDGEs workforce The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers who are locked in a high-stakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives Glenn Johnson 52 a mechanic at the South Bay power plant alone filed 30 complaints On one occasion Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos He also has a harassment complaint against SDGE regarding an employee who now works for Duke but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it Aside from the formal complaints Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business he said One of the other employees Jim Olkjer 56 a former assistant control room operator at the power plant filed three complaints against SDGE while Duke operated the plant because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision The grievances were either turned down or settled he said Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldnt be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April Im on a fixed income now Olkjer said in an interview I cant afford my utility bills on a fixed income The third employee Ed Edwards 42 a certified power plant mechanic said he filed one complaint against three SDGE employees in 1999 for racial discrimination One of the employees was hired by Duke That case is still pending Edwards an African-American said Duke didnt hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less-qualified white employees Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDGE were replaced with white employees when Duke took over Edwards who stopped working at the plant in February said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson I knew I wouldnt be hired he said Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDGE with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission SDGE spokesman Art Larson wouldnt comment on the allegations Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and always hires the most qualified employees In 1999 Duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the US Department of Labor for 769700 in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions Dissatisfaction With New Priorities The former employees said they werent motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state Johnson first alerted the media about Dukes behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers The employees each earned about 1000 a week All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down tossing out spare parts and operating machinery when it was broken Olkjer said he saw the plants output reduced during the worst power emergencies at least 50 times When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him Its none of your business The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant I was paid to twist wrenches Johnson said The last raise I got two years ago was 225 Thats an insult to my skill Duke said it is bringing the former SDGE employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 The workers were previously represented by another local and Duke wanted a single contract Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the companys gluttony and greed He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant Johnson Edwards and Olkjer said in the old days the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down But as soon as deregulation became law in the state things started to change SDGE would also vary the plants output but not as dramatically as Duke did they said To the best of my recollection we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time Edwards said Once Duke took the reins that changed We were no longer a family Duke has said that it adjusted the plants output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator manager of the states power grid The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid and the employees who testified werent in a position to know the whole picture said Bill Hall vice president of Dukes western operations Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan 16-18 the period cited from the control-room logs to keep supply in balance A copy of the ISO control-room logs obtained by Dow Jones Newswires shows that the ISO did make such orders during a Stage 3 emergency because it didnt need Dukes capacity which it thought too expensive -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jasonleopolddowjonescom mailtojasonleopolddowjonescom Embedded Picture Metafile

Important insight into our crisis  -----Original Message----- From TPElieaolcom mailtoTPElieaolcom  Sent Monday September 17 2001 451 AM  To SnagIt6391aolcom  Subject a rare bit of intelligence on the coming war        This is from an Afghani-American scholar Tamim Ansary whom friends of  friends at the World Bank and in the academy respect immensely  This is his  take on  Afghanistan and the whole mess we are careening into and I think it merits  serious thought  Pass it along if you know folks who might want to ponder  this addition to the national conversation  Tim    Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan  back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that  this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do  with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral  damage What else can we do  Minutes later I heard some TV pundit  discussing  whether we have the belly to do what must be done    And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard  because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for 35 years  Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell  anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing    I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden  There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the  atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those  monsters    But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan  Theyre  not even the government of Afghanistan  The Taliban are a cult of ignorant  psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997 Bin Laden is  a political criminal with a plan  When you think Taliban think Nazis  When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people  of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps    Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity  They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult  if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the  rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country    Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the  Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated  suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are  500000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy  no food There are millions of widows  And the Taliban has been burying  these widows alive in mass graves  The soil is littered with land  mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets  These are a few  of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban    We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to  the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of  it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level  their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done  Eradicate  their hospitals Done  Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off  from medicine and health care  Too late Someone already did all  that    New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs  Would  they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan  only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd   slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled  orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But  flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against  the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only  be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people  theyve been raping all this time    So what else is there What can be done then Let me now  speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is  to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly  to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the  belly to kill as many as needed  Having the belly to overcome any moral  qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand  Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because  some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan  to Bin Ladens hideout  Its much bigger than that folks Because  to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would  they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be  first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going  Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West    And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly  what he wants Thats why he did this  Read his speeches and statements  Its all right there  He really believes Islam would beat the  West It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world  into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers  If the West wreaks  a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing  left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view  Hes probably wrong in the end the West would win whatever that would  mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just  theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else    Tamim Ansary    Max Harris Executive Director  Wisconsin Humanities Council  222 S Bedford Street  Madison  WI 53703  Phone 608262-0706  Fax

management lacked an honor among thieves but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish  I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now---sch Is Enron the New Drexel By Michael Lewis the author of Liars Poker and The New New Thing Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg -- Enron Corp is rapidly expanding the American business journalists notion of what is possible No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true The boss Kenneth Lay was a friend of the current president of these United States an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers The company itself was rated strong buy by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms and plugged endlessly by the business press Six years running as Fortunes most innovative company And all the while this same operation was at the very top a lie Understandably people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation but really there isnt a good one Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management Michael Milkens junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay Alumni Will Flourish True in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them And in both cases the core business -- Drexels junk bonds and Enrons energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didnt go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc and Duke Energy Corp Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell the energy trading business will return to normal But the morality of the cases are entirely different Whatever you think of Milkens junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones He paid himself huge sums of money but he also made huge sums for his firm He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him and they loved him for it The Enron bosses by contrast pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was Milken created an operation which was if anything much more profitable than it looked What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses This is something I still dont understand and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines Indian power plants and the like Why did Enron which made its money as an intermediary invest in this stuff in the first place The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel In Drexels case it took a multiyear investigation by the US government together with a smear campaign in the press to bring down the business In Enrons case all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out among other things that senior executives were profiting at the companys expense In Drexels case the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story In Enrons the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top Anything is possible Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg -- Enron Corp is rapidly expanding the American business journalists notion of what is possible No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true The boss Kenneth Lay was a friend of the current president of these United States an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers The company itself was rated strong buy

sscott3enroncom Pharms Melinda Subject09Summary- Judges Recommendation re Retroactive Refunds Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that  you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink  Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at 449  PM today  Attached is the complete work 20 The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- While the amount of such refunds is not 89 billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum  At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California  Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller   The Chief Judge thinks not  Another notable quote  it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated 20 The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5 which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also  rejected20 20 Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2 2000 for sales  in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX  The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date  Spot market sales are sales that a re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery20 Evidentiary Hearing- The differences between what the State of California  believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what  the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds  involve factual disputes  Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to  the methodology set forth below  Because of the urgent need for an answer  to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule   It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding  However such a methodology may not be  appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an  after-the-fact refund calculation    In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund  period Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order  to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober 2 2000 through May 28 2001 20 Heat Rate- The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based  upon a daily spot gas price  In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP15 North of Path 15 the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the  marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour  If  the marginal unit is located in SP15 South of Path 15 the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour   The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the  refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays20 OM Adder-  An adder of 6MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price 20 Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January 5 2001 when PGE  and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea l-time imbalance energy market  Adjustment bids would also be treated the  same as set forth in the June 19th Order20 Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear  The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 non-emergen cy requirement of the June 19th Order  To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets-  Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated  Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

Subject09Summary- Judges Recommendation re Retroactive Refunds Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that  you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink  Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at 449  PM today  Attached is the complete work 20 The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- While the amount of such refunds is not 89 billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum  At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California  Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller   The Chief Judge thinks not  Another notable quote  it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated 20 The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5 which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also  rejected20 20 Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2 2000 for sales  in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX  The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date  Spot market sales are sales that a re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery20 Evidentiary Hearing- The differences between what the State of California  believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what  the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds  involve factual disputes  Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to  the methodology set forth below  Because of the urgent need for an answer  to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule   It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding  However such a methodology may not be  appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an  after-the-fact refund calculation    In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund  period Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order  to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober 2 2000 through May 28 2001 20 Heat Rate- The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based  upon a daily spot gas price  In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP15 North of Path 15 the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the  marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour  If  the marginal unit is located in SP15 South of Path 15 the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour   The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the  refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays20 OM Adder-  An adder of 6MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price 20 Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January 5 2001 when PGE  and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea l-time imbalance energy market  Adjustment bids would also be treated the  same as set forth in the June 19th Order20 Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear  The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 non-emergen cy requirement of the June 19th Order  To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets-  Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated  Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

Yoder Christian Sanders Richard B Subject	As the CAISO Turns  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs long-term contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought  I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention 1  According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions 2  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy Real-Time auction first  CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section 862 d  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy  If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as 000  Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR 3  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as 000  Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it 4  While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis  Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers  The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low  Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts  Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO 5  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of 000 expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to 000  These SCs are in for a big surprise  According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as 400MWh for imbalance energy  Where is the price mitigation here 6  Who benefits under this scam  Davis and CDWR  Who loses under this scam  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy 7  Sources  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also 8  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no real-time price transparency We may see an hourly ex-post price of say 15 but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets 9  Here is the

Cc	DL-Portland Volume Mgmt Subject	487 Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487 487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds 15000mwh 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO  His response was this  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS  In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS -Kit

Implementation of Revised Target Price Methodology MARKET NOTICE October 24 2001 Implementation of Revised Target Price Methodology ISO Market Participants SC Settlements Contacts Effective Monday October 29 2001 the California Independent System Operator Corporation ISO  will revise its methodology for calculating the Target Price TP Provided below is a background on TP a brief description of the ISOs current thinking about a long-range solution and potential implementation schedule and the ISOs current short-range TP methodology to be implemented on October 29 2001 Background The ISO operates a Real-Time Market for Imbalance Energy IE  based on bids submitted by Market Participants seeking to sell incremental andor decremental Imbalance Energy  In many cases bids have a price overlap which occurs when some Scheduling Coordinators SCs are willing to buy real-time energy ie they have submitted decremental IE bids to reduce their generator output at prices higher than the prices at which other SCs are willing to sell real-time energy ie they have submitted incremental IE bids to increase their generator output In March 1998 the ISO instituted the TP to eliminate the price overlap described above The TP is a calculated price between the highest decremental bid and the lowest incremental bid  All incremental bids above the TP are adjusted down to the TP and all decremental bids below the TP are adjusted up to it Though designed to resolve the price overlap there are certain difficulties with the TP as it was implemented  The major problem was that the ISO cannot clear the overlap ie accept all overlapping bids and require the bidders to actually buy and sell at these prices  SCs can and do use the inability of the ISO to clear the price overlap to manipulate the TP by submitting unrealistically high offers to buy and unrealistically low offers to sell knowing that the ISO can not require the bidders to fulfill their bids In April 2000 the ISO sought to eliminate this gaming opportunity by changing the formula f74or calculating the TP  As a result there were many hours when the TP -- and the published price for Real Time Energy transactions - was zero  Thus while the revised methodology reduced gaming opportunities it also produced unrealistic real-time prices that distorted incentives for SCs to bid into the ISOs Real-Time Market Long-Range Solution After extensive internal review and discussion with Stakeholders the ISO has concluded that the best solution is to accept overlapping bids thus entirely eliminating the need for the TP  At its September 20 2001 meeting the ISO Governing Board approved this concept  This long-range solution will require an ISO Tariff and certain computer software changes and will not be implemented until approximately Summer 2002   Detailed below is the ISOs interim short-term TP methodology that will become effective three business days after this Market Notice on October 29 2001 Short-Range Solution Also described in the ISO staff memorandum presented at the September 20 2001 ISO Governing Board meeting and as discussed at the October 3 2001 and 11 2001 Market Issues Forum meetings the ISO will implement an interim solution to address some of the difficulties with the current methodology until the ISO can implement the longer-range solution  Thus by this Market Notice Market Participants are noticed that the ISO will implement the TP methodology described herein effective Monday October 29 The revised methodology is similar to the original TP methodology but features several important enhancements to limit gaming opportunities by incorporation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC orders for price mitigation limiting the ability of Participating Generators and Participating Loads to set the TP and permitting only feasible bids to be eligible to set the TP Under the original TP methodology as established in March 1998 a TP replaced all bid prices within the incremental - decremental price overlap The TP was calculated as the market-clearing price MCP that would result if the overlapping incremental and decremental bids were matched with one another and Dispatched in merit order through BEEP  Graphically this Target Price can be calculated as the intersection between the incremental supply curve and the mirror image of the decremental supply curve over the price axis as shown in Figure 1 OLEObj Figure 1 Price overlap elimination by Target Price The interim or short-range TP methodology differs from the original TP methodology in the following ways 	Only bids from Generating Units under Participating Generator Agreements PGA or Loads with Participating Load Agreements PLA will be eligible to set the TP  This restriction is needed to ensure compliance with FERC requirements that only participating resources are eligible to set the MCP  When the ISO does not Dispatch Imbalance Energy the TP will become the MCP  Thus only Generators with PGAs and Loads under PLAs will be eligible to set the TP  For this reason inter-tie transactions will not be eligible to set the TP 	Only capacity that can be Dispatched within 10 minutes will be eligible to set the TP  This requirement ensures that the TP can only be set by Generating Units that actually can be Dispatched to meet Californias Load  This capacity will be based on the total of all Energy and Capacity products and services bids submitted by each Generating Unit    For example a Generating Unit with a 1MWminute ramp rate can only increase or decrease its output by 10 MW within a 10-minute interval regardless of the combination of Ancillary Services capacity and Supplemental Energy bids it has submitted  Thus its qualifying capacity would be 10 MW  Priority in allocating bids to the qualifying capacity will be based first on lowest bid price and then on increasing qualities of service  Although only qualifying capacity will be considered in the TP calculation all bids within the price overlap will be adjusted to the resulting TP 	As a final adjustment the TP will not be higher than the lowest available gas-fired resource proxy price as calculated for the corresponding hour unless such a proxy price is below the bottom of the price overlap  In any such case the TP will be set to the lowest incremental Energy bid The Target Price will also not exceed the applicable Price Cap  This provision will ensure that bids dispatched under the TP will conform to the FERCs requirements on market mitigation pricing The short-term TP methodology will use the following equation TP  max0 minTP LPP PRC  LIP	1 where TP	is the adjusted Target Price TP	is the Target Price that clears the price overlap LPP	is the lowest proxy price applicable to gas-fired resources LIP	is the lowest incremental price PRC	is the applicable Price Cap Please direct questions regarding the TP methodology and this Market Notice to Greg Ford at gfordcaisocom mailtogfordcaisocom  or Telephone 916 351-2144 Client Relations Communications CRCommunicationscaisocom mailtoCRCommunicationscaisocom

flourish  I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now---sch Is Enron the New Drexel By Michael Lewis the author of Liars Poker and The New New Thing Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg -- Enron Corp is rapidly expanding the American business journalists notion of what is possible No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true The boss Kenneth Lay was a friend of the current president of these United States an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers The company itself was rated strong buy by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms and plugged endlessly by the business press Six years running as Fortunes most innovative company And all the while this same operation was at the very top a lie Understandably people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation but really there isnt a good one Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management Michael Milkens junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay Alumni Will Flourish True in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them And in both cases the core business -- Drexels junk bonds and Enrons energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didnt go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc and Duke Energy Corp Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell the energy trading business will return to normal But the morality of the cases are entirely different Whatever you think of Milkens junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones He paid himself huge sums of money but he also made huge sums for his firm He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him and they loved him for it The Enron bosses by contrast pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was Milken created an operation which was if anything much more profitable than it looked What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses This is something I still dont understand and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines Indian power plants and the like Why did Enron which made its money as an intermediary invest in this stuff in the first place The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel In Drexels case it took a multiyear investigation by the US government together with a smear campaign in the press to bring down the business In Enrons case all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out among other things that senior executives were profiting at the companys expense In Drexels case the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story In Enrons the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top Anything is possible Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg -- Enron Corp is

mailtoJhadams69aolcom Sent Monday October 08 2001 836 PM To Williams III Bill Subject Homework Hi Bill -I read through the stuff you gave me and I do have a few questions First did you get my resume and letter and did they download OK  I am looking forward to the interview and assuming I do well am anxious to get started  So let me know about a timeline when you can please What kind of affect will a west-wide RTO have on Enron  I saw in a couple of the newsletters that FERC is pushing hard for it  -A west wide RTO is very good for Enron as it would facilitate moving energy around the grid and contribute to marketing efficiency Wood also proposes FERC initiate a rulemaking on market design and structure to translate the eight RTO functions in Order No 2000 into concrete protocols for the RTO organizations  Is there anywhere I can find out what the 8 RTO functions are  You should be able to find more information regarding RTOs on the nerc and ferc websites national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision A lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost  Do you do any trading in gas  We do not trade gas on real-time but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side Canada -- New Alberta Power Plant  Do you move any Canadian electricity  We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently though we do not schedule the energy into Canada We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border The CPUC has suspended direct access switches  What kind of impact does this have on trading  How does Californias Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA  This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here Northwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted 500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices  A judge said they were just and fair  Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor  Yes it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades In short its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW Enron and PGE There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN  Will this have any effect on you  To put it bluntly will you still be able to hire from the outside  Will the sale do anything to the 100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron   The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price How close are we to having BPAs transmission system under FERC jurisdiction  What does Enron think of that or do they care Dynegy Exelon Entergy Cinergy -- who are these guys    Dynegy and Exelon are power companies like Enron-Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon Exelon said  it would reduce its  2001 estimates due to power market volatility and  it would cut an additional 450 positions   Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market or did Exelon just do a shitty job  That would be the latter SoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money  What happens if it goes bankrupt  How does that affect Enron overall and would it change the daily trading process  -Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is I believe it is minimal on the trading desk Tell me about Qualifying Facility QF suppliers This will take a while How will green power enter into your mix  It doesnt yet Green power just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good Cal-ISOs director of grid planning  testified that the cost  of 1500 MW of new capacity is justified as a way to prevent power sellers market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production  Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CAs energy crisis  As California creates new capacity will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do or will they just have more power to deal with A long or short market is just a part of trading For example the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have All for now  Thanks for the information The acronyms are incredible  It was like these things were written in a foreign language  Looking forward to hearing from you   The acronyms are incredible but they all make sense after a while John

enjoy NewportMy friend lives down there in Huntington Beach watch out for him he moved down there about 3 months ago  I have been planning on visiting him for a while  I wouldnt mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down  Last time I was in LA I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home  Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--Steven Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end the guy was NOT good--which was nice  Also one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show I think  So I definitely need to go down there for a visit  I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July 16th thru 18th and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off  So whatever if I make it down there it should be a decent time Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland hope you can make it though the deck seems stacked against you this time around  I will plan for you to be here so you wouldnt be stuck in a hotel but dont worry if you cant get here on the 3rd  Plenty of time for that as the sun should be out for a while til October anyway I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday get a few runs in before 10 but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt St Helens on my bike instead  Its supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you cant pass such weekends up  St Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains  Well see though either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains So work was solid today got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to  No one brought me lunch after working the night shiftbut what can you do Anyway hope the funeral goes well you knowas it can and keep me posted on whenif you might get up to Portland  Oh  And as for a picture Ill see what I can do  Brendans got a couple but I dont have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you  I admit I have been called an Ogre before I am a bit of a taller bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it butwellBrendan should be able to fill you in  Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture Enjoy your time in LA And take care Bill -----Original Message-----From 	nikki cole -nikoleexcitecomENRON

sorry I couldnt write you yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients  But Im writing you now  I just pray that I wont get too busy today  That probably wont work all that well since Im here and not at church where I should be  Catholics are funny about that stuff  Yep  Im the good little Catholic girl  My moms a first grade Catholic private school teacher my dad used to teach CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and confeesion on Saturdays  It doent always work out so well if you know what I mean  I took a Sunday shift today didnt I Anyhow the POrtland trip  Let me share with you the dilemma  Ok I set aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation  That money is currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral in LA  Also my family members the son of the one who died was coming up to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive restraunts etc  So that probably wont happen  But basically its the first reason  I dont know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane ticket plus any other details food funeral flowersgifts etc and still get to go to Portland Plus Im moving in a month so Im going to have moving expenses as well Ughhh  I want to go soooo bad But things all happen for a reason  It looks like I may not be able to go but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket Aprox 3 hours later Well I just got off the phone with you so you actually know all about the about issues above  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour  WOW I dont think I can send my picture on this computer  Ill try but it may not work  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think Im an ogre is that spelled right  I tell you what Ill send you one if you send me one  Deal  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the other person looks like that you are talking to  Then again some people look better in pictures than in real life  Im not fortunate enough to be one of those Geez we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I dont really have anything to say  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to reference this  Oh well saved by the bella co-worker of mine has just bought me lunch He really is a sweet guy  Im not sure but I think hes a little slow Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do the filing and patient transport for me  He is such a nice guy  then today he knows Im moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in to bring me lunch  Awwwh  I am going to miss alot of people out here You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit  Any ideas when that might be  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you that oyu have extended to me  If you are in my vicinity you are more than welcome to stay with me and Ill show you around  Unless of course you are coming out soon then it would be more like ok we are two lost tourist I would love to see alot of the LA things  Sunset BLVD Universal Studios all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area  I hear they are fabulous  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around Ill be well versed in the places to be  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the Wishire Regency Hotel  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet  Complete with chocolate covered strawberries  Yummm Oh I am a fanatic about desserts I better not keeping Lee waiting  Hes figitty  Talk to you soon Nikki Send a cool gift with your E-Card httpwwwbluemountaincomgiftcenter

devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias power-buying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer ChaosInexperience Hobbled Power Buyers State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L RABIN Times Staff Writers August 12 2001 It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis when Californias first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening trying to figure how to keep the lights on when a speeding tractor-trailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising said Ray Hart head of the energy planning team The symbolism was not lost on him The next day with the states electricity supply on the line and the governors political career on the blink Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West purchasing electricity for 10 million customers whose utilities were going broke Now seven months and billions of dollars later the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry Even Gov Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch Its like the Yankees playing a stickball team he said in a recent interview Were totally out of our league The administrations new long-term contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future Making matters worse nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companies--a fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements Five were hastily fired and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations How an agency could forget conflict-of-interest codes or ignore them is beyond me said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica This is the way people lose faith in government Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in including one from Davis Republican political rival Secretary of State Bill Jones Amid all the controversy of recent days Hart said the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed Frankly said Hart a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources its kind of disconcerting we arent getting the credit we should be getting Patching Together a Team on the Fly The states new energy-buying organization was a beg borrow and recruit operation A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project The agency received an immediate infusion of 22 million to create its expanded trading arm of 88 employees and consultants On the fly Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas  Electric Southern California Edison and the energy industry Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand From the start the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day a state budget document said It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively Professionals in this business are highly compensated Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February They said Can you be up here Tuesday  said Mead a 55-year-old former Edison engineer from Duarte I said For a job interview And they said No bring enough stuff for several months  They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume Mead said He worked six weeks he said before he finally got a contract to sign In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage 2 on the verge of blackouts he said There was no focus other than to keep the lights on One day Mead said he bought 10 of all power consumed on the states electricity grid during his 12-hour shift But unlike Mead most of the new crew had never bought power before according to their resumes Most worked at the now-defunct California Power Exchange an energy trading floor similar to a stock market reconciling sales and purchases made by others Before that one worked at a freight-forwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group Theyre just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast said Mark Palmer spokesman for Houston-based Enron Corp one of the nations largest energy marketers Its like someone who flies a kite one day and then is told to go fly a 747 the next One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings You dont just come out to someone and say Whats your price and then pay it But thats what some of them have done A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them Palmer said California for the salaries its paying could have done better A particular lightning rod for criticism is the 480000 two-year contract of chief trader Susan T Lee 30 who was hired in April for 120 an hour With barely a years experience in the energy industry she leads a 16-person crew that buys electricity the day before its needed or for nearly immediate use State records show that Lee was paid more than 30000 a month including overtime as she began her new duties That ladys got one years experience and shes getting 500 grand Palmer said An experienced trader in private industry he said might make 80000 to 120000 in a good year plus bonuses Shes certainly making double what I am but shes worth it said Hart who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the once-obscure Department of Water Resources Although Lee could not be reached for comment Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of todays evolving trading market California energy deregulation began only in 1996 and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year he said I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody regardless of experience Lees team members meanwhile have been signed to lucrative short-term contracts worth a maximum of 15000 to 21000 a month including housing rental cars per diem pay and flights home on days off State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didnt think they were qualified Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete They know more than me theyve seen it all said state trader Bernard Barretto a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in 1998 In their own defense the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost Our job was to buy whatever we could buy former trader Elaine Griffin said California was truly a captive market Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higher-ups Do the traders go out and start the deal Yes Hart said Do they cut the final deal No Far from the trading trenches the governor sees things differently The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources he said These are very sophisticated operations Davis said They have several meteorologists and banks of media people To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of Californias power-buying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving They used Lees old Long Beach firm Mieco Inc and Allegheny Power to camouflage the states identity as the buyer The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills Some traders however saw through the guise The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tip-off that California had weighed in I knew it and Im pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it too said one trader who like others asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state But it worked for a while It helped keep the short-term prices down Controversy Over Stock Holdings The state traders were powerless however to protect themselves Just as they were settling into their new jobs and energy prices were falling the administration was stung by the disclosures that 11 of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firm--San Jose-based Calpine Corp--in which they had owned stock The highest-ranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira who was hired on a 500000 contract in January to negotiate long-term power contracts The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng Elaine Griffin who had resigned just days before the firings also held Calpine stock while trading for the state Most of the traders who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares Mead said traders on his state team--such as Cheng Leung and Louie--had no ability to influence Calpines stock price because their purchases of the companys electricity were infrequent and small Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because hed made so much money on it He said his investments of 20000 in 1999 and 134000 last fall brought him about 400000 when he was ordered to sell last month You want to know how I picked Calpine he said Investors Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his 2000 worth of shares on Jan 22 while still at the Power Exchange which had a conflict-of-interest policy barring ownership of energy stock I didnt know I would have an opportunity like this at the time Leung said of his briefly held state job I bought it just because Im interested in the market all the time I follow it Today shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings The big boys the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention Mead said Theyre the ones who knew how things worked Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in
