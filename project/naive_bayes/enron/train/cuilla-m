Wasssup.  I just got back from vacation so still trying to catch up.  I would love to go to lunch but I have not been allowed to go to lunch for two years.  I work on the trading floor - trading natural gas - and thanks to the lovely invention of EnronOnLine (our online trading program) we have lunch delivered in everyday and aren't allowed to leave.  It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it.  Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon.  Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour.  x35933

Hey Martin this is Vassigh Willy D's friend.
I just started a project here at Enron this week.

I am working with the Global Settlements group on the 18th floor.

My phone extension is 5-8679 just thru tomorrow.  I am out of the office Thur and Friday and will get my permanent seat next week.

This project is going thru at Least Next August - so we should go to lunch sometime.

Let me know

Late
Brian

I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.  
 
Thanks,

 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/head_god_gives_shout-out.gif>


      SOUTH BRONX, NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

 	   <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out.jpg>	
Above: Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset). 	

      "Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years," said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. "I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."

      "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.

      As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

      "Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."

      Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

      In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

      God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

      "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."

  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	
Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	

      As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

      "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."

      Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

      "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. Cornell West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."

      The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."

      "God is the Original," Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."

      Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

      Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

      "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."

      "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat."

If I would have kept my whole EOG position it would be worth 80,000 right now.  If I would have kept half - 55,000 or a brand new bmw 540.  Instead we have an IS 300.

Martin,

Coral Energy Canada is billing ENA for 3 deals for the production month of Sep-01.  However, I cannot find anything in the system which matches these deals.  Upon contacting Coral, they have stated that you are the trader on each of these deals.  The Coral Energy Canada trader is Shane Lee.  The detail for these deals is below.  Please advise as to where they might be in the system or what my next step is to be so that I may settle this account.

Dates		Pipeline	Volume	Price		Total
Sep 13		Union		100,000mm	2.74000		$274,000.00
Sep 12		Union		201,000mm	2.80000		$562,800.00

Do you want to make a wager on the Horn's record this year?

I am proposing that we will not lose more than two games this year (regular and bowl).

 	 Scientists kill mice with dance music
  <http://images.thisislondon.com/img/spacer.gif>
by Danielle Demetriou 

Scientists who forced drugged mice to endure fatal doses of loud dance music have been accused of " despicable" cruelty by animal welfare campaigners. 

The study by Cambridge University examined how loud music strengthens the harmful effects of methamphetamine, the drug commonly known as speed. 

Wendy Higgins of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: "These sick experiments are absolutely despicable. Just because people choose to take drugs and go to raves doesn't justify subjecting animals to suffering and death in a laboratory." 

The scientists, who used a total of 238 mice in the experiment, concluded that loud music strengthened the toxic effects of methamphetamine in animals.

Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Janikowski Allegations Getting
More Serious


I reported on our message boards Monday night about the "Janikowski
Shenanigans" with him falling down at a night club resulting in a cut to his
head requiring stitches.   Chris Mortensen reported the Raider brass were
simply calling it "Sebastian being Sebastian".   Coach Jon Gruden joked that
he was just "glad he fell on his head and not his leg".   Most sort of
shrugged it off as "those crazy Raiders".

But now it's getting a little more serious with this CNNSI article:
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/10/09/raiders_janikowski
_ap/

Janikowski Hurt in Fall After "Apparent Drug Overdose"

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a
nightclub due to "an apparent drug overdose," cutting his face and requiring
five stitches a few hours after the Raiders' game against Dallas, police
said Tuesday.

Janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar
reported he had collapsed early Monday morning, police spokesman Dewayne
Tully said.

Janikowski, 23, who attended team meetings later Monday, was not arrested,
Tully said. A police report indicated the club's doorman told officers that
Janikowski was "possibly overdosing on GHB" -- the so-called date-rape drug.

Last April in Florida, Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug
possession and evidence tampering after being accused of possessing GHB.

In the police report Monday, officers wrote they "found Janikowski
incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor. As a result of the
uncontrolled flailing, Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut
over his right eye."

Janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him, and he was placed in
soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital, the police report
said.

Janikowski's roommate, Jay Hoffman, told police the kicker was not taking
drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who
may have slipped something into his drink.

Other witnesses at the club told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily
taking what appeared to be GHB earlier in the evening.

Paul Healy, the kicker's agent, said Janikowski needed stitches for a head
wound. He said his client had been drinking, and said reports of a drug
overdose were "totally false."

"I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and slipped and
fell. At a lot of these clubs, people spill their drinks, and he slipped and
whacked his head," Healy said. "You don't have a drug overdose Sunday night
and go to practice Monday morning."

Asked about the police report, Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said Tuesday
the team would have no comment.

Raiders coaches said Janikowski appeared fine Monday. The kicker, who has
made all eight of his field goals this season, was not in the locker room in
the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games.

Janikowski, a native of Poland, was Oakland's first-round choice in the 2000
draft after starring at Florida State.

In June 2000, Janikowski was acquitted on a charge he offered a Tallahassee
policeman $300 to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who
wouldn't let him into a local nightclub.

His contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about $25,000
for every game he misses due to suspension. The clause was added because of
his run-ins with the law.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


First thing - nothing has been proven.   It's important to note we're
talking about allegations here.   But clearly, this isn't as funny now.   He
likely skates here without too much trouble but it's probably a sign that
you need a "plan B" if Janikowski is your kicker.   Just to be safe.   More
as we hear it.

Subject:	Weekend Events.........

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?

About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).  

On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.  

On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.  

The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.  

Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.  

Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.

In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.

Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?  

Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

Regards

Bharat

There is a very good website for getting information regarding current
events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you
want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade
Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming
evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind
and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that
gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before
(embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this
year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of
terror by ending his life!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of
Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the
suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the
conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the
sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used
a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another
group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the
Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the
speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very
much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were
briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that
Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But
the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one
connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated
the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who
could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration
appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in
the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting
Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the
Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet
determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination
would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism
campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested
allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are
so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to
be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the
government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause
added tension between the two countries!

Don't be so ignorant!  It's UN-American!

Whoever is responsible will be taken care of - we don't need to take it
upon
ourselves.

I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and mic=
helle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to =
it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be =
bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the be=
tting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept askin=
g are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn'=
t say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool=
 about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are =
going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I wal=
k in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we =
had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts l=
eaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to =
email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls=
.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like an=
d she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you coul=
d say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs. =
 It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that=
 i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weeke=
nd.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it =
is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20

I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing
earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably
is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is
14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average
of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a
$2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are
going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which
would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to
wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then
maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from
trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or
more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the
bottom.

Men Using Viagra With 'Club Drugs'

Doctors say gay and straight men who are getting Viagra and combining it with "club drugs" like ecstasy may be risking their lives.

Large numbers of homosexual men, and a smaller number of heterosexuals, are combining Viagra with illicit drugs to achieve a potentially deadly "sexual high," a new study finds. 

The men combine the popular impotence drug with illicit "club drugs" such as ecstasy, ketamine, amphetamines, GHB, and "poppers." 

The study, discussed last week at the Centers for Disease Control's HIV ( news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22HIV%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=HIV>) Prevention Conference, focuses on high-risk behavior among gay men who use Viagra to heighten their sexual experience. 

San Francisco epidemiologist Andrea Kim, who conducted the study, says it and other studies in California and London have shown that "gay men are combining Viagra with other drugs much more frequently when compared to heterosexual men" and that puts them at higher risk. Her sa common side effect of club drugs is loss of erection. 

"We know that ecstasy and methamphetamines reduce sexual function, so the men are using Viagra to enhance their sexual ability," Kim says. 

Partygoers often combine Viagra with amyl nitrite, an inhaled stimulant commonly referred to as "poppers." 

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Chief of Toxicology and emergency room physician Dr. Daniel Keyes says that "amyl nitrite makes the heart race and combining these drugs can cause cardiac events." 

Like Viagra, amyl nitrite causes blood vessel dilation and a drop in blood pressure. Combining two blood pressure lowering drugs can be fatal if a person has a heart attack or stroke. 

Although rare, another medical condition that can occur is priapism, a severely painful problem that can result in permanent damage caused by the penis being erect for many hours.

Police follow naked man to pot crop

CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday. 

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island. 

The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out. 

When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana. 

According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed. 

In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation." 

Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants. 

Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer. 

In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people." 

The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo. 

Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything. 

Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles. 

The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

Now you can enjoy the benefits of convenient online ordering and home 
delivery for medications that you take on an ongoing basis - even if 
you currently fill these prescriptions at your local retail pharmacy.

Recent enhancements to merckmedco.com now make it even easier for you 
to see which of your prescriptions can be filled through Merck-Medco's 
Home Delivery Pharmacy. 

When you choose to refill a prescription through home delivery, you can:
* Enjoy at-home prescription delivery and the convenience of online 
  ordering anytime, from any computer with Internet access. 
* Receive a larger days' supply of medication -- usually up to 90 
  days -- which saves you trips to the drugstore and in some cases, 
  saves you money.
* Check prescription order status, pricing and coverage online.
* Receive e-mails notifying you of your prescription order status. 

To see which prescriptions may be eligible for home delivery, simply:
* Click on this link or copy it into your browser window:
  https://host1.merck-medco.com/cgi-bin/Br.cgi?-PW-MyRxRtTb 
* Then log in using your email address and password.
* After you click on the "login" button, you'll be presented with our 
  "Retail Prescriptions" area, where you can see a detailed history of 
  recent prescriptions you filled at a retail pharmacy. 

Any medication with a little blue house next to it indicates that the 
prescription is eligible for home delivery. When you click on the blue 
house, you can compare your current co-payment with the savings you would 
receive if you choose home delivery.  If you decide that you would like 
to take advantage of home delivery savings, we contact your healthcare 
provider and keep you informed every step of the way via e-mail.

anywhwere and will be here next summer and the one afeter that and the one 
after that....  Don?t know when you need to use your vacation time by, but 
maybe we can go sking this winter.

Like I said, I will be in Texas from the 21st to the 1st of October or so, 
then off to Maine to see my aunt.  Hopefully we?ll see each other ( I need 
to get my shit out of your closet and into my storage place anyways!!, 
Thanks and sorry about that!)

Say hi to Zooey for me and see you in a few weeks hopefully.

I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woman she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  After several other uses of fuck she hung up.  I switched our service to att (never thought i would be happy to be an att customer again) and called back and got another manager who claims she is taking care of it.

Jason,
Hey man just wanting to see what's going on. From what I've heard you've 
been doing an okay job with my P&L. Only been able to check the market a 
couple of times-it doesn't look like too much has happened. How's the Mid 
Continent? Can't wait to get back-I hope you didn't take my job back. I'm 
here at the London School of Economics and their sytems won't aallow me to 
get on enrononline. Well, have a fun trip down to Beaurevage(sp?) see you I 
guess on Tues.(I'll be there Mon) Tell Martin not to lose all of that P&L 
you made me seeing how he is trading on triple coupon day.

Later,
Denver

I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.  They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check for the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the Lexus from Dorland.

	Yeah - already gave everyone the lowdown on the price break.
Apparently, that is purely an internet special because Nicole tried to call
and they were quoting $340.00.  Either that, or we just got lucky as hell

Hey I want to check with you about pulling $750 from our checking account to deposit into my gambling account.  No I have not lost $1,000 but I am following a model and I take all the games it says and there are more than 20 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided.  I know the next question and so far I have lost $150 but I didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and I would have won $150.  Anyway, I would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise I am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend.  On a side note, the furniture people called and said the furniture is coming in in pieces and they should have it all by November which means it would ship to us between the 1st and 3 week of November but definitely before Thanksgiving.

I called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95.  After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax.  I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.  Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month.

How much is the Montefeltro and the Legacy - I assume they can shoot 2
3/4 to 3 inch.  Which would you recommend (between Montefeltro, Legacy
and Super Black Eagle) - I mainly hunt pheasant and quail but would also
like a gun that I can hunt ducks and geese with.  Since I plan to hunt
some ducks and geese should I get a camo gun?  Any other suggestions or
recommedations?

There is a very good website for getting information regarding current events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the
government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause
added tension between the two countries!

Don't be so ignorant!  It's UN-American!

Whoever is responsible will be taken care of - we don't need to take it upon

Martin,
Apparently you live right next door to friends of mine.  Dana Welsh and Gerald King were neighbors of mine when I lived in Houston in 1998, and my wife and I still keep in contact with them.  As a matter of fact, we'll be staying with them on November 11 & 12 before their wedding, and might knock on your door to meet you.  Funny, Dana mentioned in the past you worked for Enron, but it's such a big company I didn't think I might know you.

There is a very good website for getting information regarding current
events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you
want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade
Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming
evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind
and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that
gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before
(embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this
year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of
terror by ending his life!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of
Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the
suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the
conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the
sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used
a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another
group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the
Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the
speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very
much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were
briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that
Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But
the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one
connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated
the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who
could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration
appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in
the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting
Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the
Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet
determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination
would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism
campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested
allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are
so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to
be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the
government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause
added tension between the two countries!

Don't be so ignorant!  It's UN-American!

Whoever is responsible will be taken care of - we don't need to take it
upon
ourselves.

Martin - 

Do you think that we are finished with intra-day Chicago call?  There is no need to settle up until we are finished.  When we are done, lets create an annuity into my book and I'll take care of PGL's share.  Thanks

Hey is your car a LS or GS, how many miles and what year?  There is a quy selling a Lexus IS 300 (entry level four door sedan below) because he is moving back to Canada - might be able to pick it up on the cheap.  Probably could sell yours payoff your note and buy this one with a new 5 year note for around $450/month

We got home too late last night to call you, but I wanted to tell you what a
wonderful evening we had and thank you for being such a thoughtful son.
Drillion was just great.  I have never seen anything like it!  After seeing
Drillion a regular circus would be dull and boring.

The Old Warsaw was everything you described and more.  Fur coats and big
diamonds are still in style and I saw plenty of them at the Warsaw.   The
service was impeccable, the music was soothing and relaxing, and I've never
eaten a better meal.  Dad had the lobster thermador and I had the
tenderloin.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  The young man at the table
next to us proposed to his girlfriend and the ring was hidden under grapes
in a silver goblet.  It was very romantic and the staff made a big
production of it so we all enjoyed it.

I wanted to call you this morning to thank you but I know things are in
turmoil at work and I didn't want to disturb you.  We will call this
evening.

Your wonderful gift was very much appreciated and enjoyed by both Dad and I.

Love,

Mom

He said he would probably sell it around 28K which is probably $3,000-$4,000 below what you would pay new.

I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary. Let me know if you want to see it. I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day.

Police follow naked man to pot crop 
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>
By Brian Kelly 
Herald Writer 


CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday. 

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island. 

The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out. 

When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana. 

According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed. 

In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation." 

Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants. 

Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer. 

In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people." 

The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo. 

Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything. 

Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles. 

The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

see below - I still have to find someone whose email we can send the requests but I will do that by tomorrow

During weeks 1 through weeks 10 we will conduct free agent drafts.  Each team will start with 100 fantasy points to use for bidding on free agents and will be awarded points each week based on your finish that week.  The highest scoring team will receive 1 point and the lowest scoring team will receive 10 points.  Each Thursday at 12pm we will conduct a free agent draft.  You must submit a list of the players you want to bid on with the points you bid on them to an email address yet to be determined.  After 12pm the highest bidder for each player will we awarded the free agent.  You can bid 0 points for a player but will lose if anyone else bids at least 1 point.  

If you have a Defense or Kicker on a bye week, you can pick up a bye week replacement from the free agent pool for free.  After the bye week is over, you must drop the replacement player.  Bye week replacements must be submitted via email to mcuilla@enron.com and will be awarded based on lowest YTD points scored.

Martin,
Apparently you live right next door to friends of mine.  Dana Welsh and Gerald King were neighbors of mine when I lived in Houston in 1998, and my wife and I still keep in contact with them.  As a matter of fact, we'll be staying with them on November 11 & 12 before their wedding, and might knock on your door to meet you.  Funny, Dana mentioned in the past you worked for Enron, but it's such a big company I didn't think I might know you.

Kayvan,
 
Attached is a copy of my resume.  Things are very volatile over here so I am not sure what to expect for the next three months, but if possible (and if Enron isn't banktrupt) I would like to stay here until Febuary 5.  If we are around until then, I would like to try to make a choice on a potential job by early January.  Of course if we go bankrupt everything could change.  I would like to come up sometime soon and see what options exist and how I could fit into AEP's plans.  It was good talking to you and I hope to hear from you soon.
 
Thanks,
 
Martin

When does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid.  I thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe I am confused.  Also, since the raise was effective starting Sept. 1, will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary?  
 
Thanks,

I've thought about you a few times in the last few months, didn't want to intrude upon an already bad situation with my bullshit questions.  I'm hearing some pretty depressing stuff from the people I know at ENE.
 
I wish I had the capital to open my own shop?there will be talent and opportunity a plenty on the market soon.  I'll ask around?I've got some friends at Duke and Dynegy from B-school, the Gianoucous (spelling??) brothers (John and Dimitri?from elementary school) started their own outfit a while back, and my old man is at Schlumberger and has good contacts in general (if you aren't married to a trading environment).
 
Give me a few days, and I'll be in touch.

I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and mic=

it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be =
bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the be=
tting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept askin=
g are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn'=
t say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool=
 about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are =
going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I wal=
k in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we =
had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts l=
eaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to =
email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls=
.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like an=
d she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you coul=
d say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs. =
 It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that=
 i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weeke=

is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20

I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing
earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably
is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is
14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average
of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a
$2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are
going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which
would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to
wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then
maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from
trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or
more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the
bottom.

Looks like new ones are going for $31,000 - what is your real offer.  My wife is looking for a new car so I am seriously interested.

Martin,
	This Sitara deal #270180 ends in June 2001.  However, I received an invoice from KCS for July production at meter #36381.  At Edwards #2-19 they are invoicing me for a total of 62 MMBtu, and at Russell #1-20 they are invoicing me for 124 MMBtu.  Should this deal have been extended to include July, or is there another deal out there?  These deals do not show up in Unify.  Please advise.  Thank you.

Storey and I were talking about different places to look for coverages and insurance for death (regarding his father).  Were are some of the non standard (ie not life insurance) coverages that he should make sure he has checked.  His dad was on a business trip from Houston to NY.

Hello Mr. Cuilla,

Per our conversation on yesterday, I am sending you this email with the
information that I am needing to update. I am attaching a sheet that would
be very helpful if you could fill it out. In filling this out, this will
help us in finding the right opportunity for the right candidate. If you

Wasssup.  I just got back from vacation so still trying to catch up.  I would love to go to lunch but I have not been allowed to go to lunch for two years.  I work on the trading floor - trading natural gas - and thanks to the lovely invention of EnronOnLine (our online trading program) we have lunch delivered in everyday and aren't allowed to leave.  It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it.  Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon.  Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour.  x35933

Hey Martin this is Vassigh Willy D's friend.
I just started a project here at Enron this week.

I am working with the Global Settlements group on the 18th floor.

My phone extension is 5-8679 just thru tomorrow.  I am out of the office Thur and Friday and will get my permanent seat next week.

This project is going thru at Least Next August - so we should go to lunch sometime.

Let me know

Late
Brian

I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.  
 
Thanks,

 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/head_god_gives_shout-out.gif>


      SOUTH BRONX, NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

 	   <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out.jpg>	
Above: Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset). 	

      "Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years," said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. "I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."

      "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.

      As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

      "Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."

      Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

      In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

      God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

      "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."

  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	
Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	

      As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

      "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."

      Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

      "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. Cornell West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."

      The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."

      "God is the Original," Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."

      Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

      Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

      "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."

      "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat."

If I would have kept my whole EOG position it would be worth 80,000 right now.  If I would have kept half - 55,000 or a brand new bmw 540.  Instead we have an IS 300.
