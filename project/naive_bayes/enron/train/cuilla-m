httpwwwtheonioncomonion3731indexhtml 	5 September 2001 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731headgodgivesshout-outgif SOUTH BRONX NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731godgivesshoutoutjpg Above Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God inset Right about now I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga whos shown Me love through the years said the Lord His booming voice descending from Heaven I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz Yall real niggaz out there you know who you are Yall was there for me and its about time Im-a give some love back to Gods true crew All yall niggaz yall be My niggaz the Lord added As of press time God has thanked nearly 7000 of His niggaz including those in New Yorks Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin it down in New Orleans Nelly and the whole St Lunatics crew Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad His peeps from back in the day and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School as well as to Lil Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up Mad props to P Diddy Jay-Z DMX Lil Kim Mystikal Eve Ja Rule Jadakiss Trick Daddy and Xzibit And one love to Meth RZA GZA Ghostface and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan the deity said These My beloved niggaz with whom I be well-pleased Now nearing the 48-hour mark the Lords first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week In addition to raps current stars God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash Busy Bee Melle Mel Jazzy Jay Kool Moe Dee Afrika Bambaataa DJ Red Alert the Cold Crush Brothers Fab 5 Freddy Kurtis Blow Kool Herc and the Funky 41 God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs record labels magazines TV shows and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years Among them are Def Jam Tommy Boy Jive Roc-A-Fella Rap Pages The Source Right On The Box Funkmaster Flex Ed Lover and Dr Dre WBLS 1075 KISS-FM and Hot 97 For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully I say thank you God said All praise to Devante Harrell Wanda Simmons LaShell Thomas and everybody else at UptownMCA for making this possible httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731godgivesshoutoutjumpjpg Above A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community God assured the nations rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven Tupac Notorious BIG Eazy-E Scott LaRock-some of yall niggaz are already up in this bitch the Lord said For those of you who were left behind know that the Lord has got your dead homies backs Faith Evans I promise Im taking real good care of your Biggie He resting in crazy peace no doubt Thus far God has not played favorites thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic DJ Phreek Malik and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them All rappers God explained are equal in His sight and none are too small to escape His notice God sees even the smallest sparrow fall said Dr Cornell West Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion The same is true of MCs Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown all rappers are His children and He loves them all The sheer volume of names notwithstanding the nations rappers are deeply touched by Gods gesture of tribute and appreciation with many stating that they feelin Him God is the Original Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word nigga On Mondays Larry King Live conservative activist Rev Calvin Butts a longtime ally of the Lord blasted Him for His shocking unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word Some concerned parties including decency crusader C Delores Tucker Sen Orrin Hatch R-UT and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children Foundation are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology Reacting to the controversy many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lords defense The word nigga means different things depending on how its used and whos saying it rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said Judging from context God obviously wasnt being derogatory He was using nigga as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene At one point He said I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock MC Serch and my man Dan The Automator-all yall is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish and the Automator is Asian-American its clear God isnt talking about race here Hes just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him Gods the ultimate playa so naturally Hes going to have some haters rapper Ice Cube said But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs you will get your ass smote True dat httpwwwtheonioncomcgi-binemailemailthiscgi

Janikowski Allegations Getting More Serious I reported on our message boards Monday night about the Janikowski Shenanigans with him falling down at a night club resulting in a cut to his head requiring stitches   Chris Mortensen reported the Raider brass were simply calling it Sebastian being Sebastian   Coach Jon Gruden joked that he was just glad he fell on his head and not his leg   Most sort of shrugged it off as those crazy Raiders But now its getting a little more serious with this CNNSI article httpsportsillustratedcnncomfootballnews20011009raidersjanikowski ap Janikowski Hurt in Fall After Apparent Drug Overdose SAN FRANCISCO AP -- Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a nightclub due to an apparent drug overdose cutting his face and requiring five stitches a few hours after the Raiders game against Dallas police said Tuesday Janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar reported he had collapsed early Monday morning police spokesman Dewayne Tully said Janikowski 23 who attended team meetings later Monday was not arrested Tully said A police report indicated the clubs doorman told officers that Janikowski was possibly overdosing on GHB -- the so-called date-rape drug Last April in Florida Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug possession and evidence tampering after being accused of possessing GHB In the police report Monday officers wrote they found Janikowski incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor As a result of the uncontrolled flailing Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut over his right eye Janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him and he was placed in soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital the police report said Janikowskis roommate Jay Hoffman told police the kicker was not taking drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who may have slipped something into his drink Other witnesses at the club told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily taking what appeared to be GHB earlier in the evening Paul Healy the kickers agent said Janikowski needed stitches for a head wound He said his client had been drinking and said reports of a drug overdose were totally false I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and slipped and fell At a lot of these clubs people spill their drinks and he slipped and whacked his head Healy said You dont have a drug overdose Sunday night and go to practice Monday morning Asked about the police report Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said Tuesday the team would have no comment Raiders coaches said Janikowski appeared fine Monday The kicker who has made all eight of his field goals this season was not in the locker room in the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games Janikowski a native of Poland was Oaklands first-round choice in the 2000 draft after starring at Florida State In June 2000 Janikowski was acquitted on a charge he offered a Tallahassee policeman 300 to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who wouldnt let him into a local nightclub His contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about 25000 for every game he misses due to suspension The clause was added because of his run-ins with the law               OUR VIEW                  First thing - nothing has been proven   Its important to note were talking about allegations here   But clearly this isnt as funny now   He likely skates here without too much trouble but its probably a sign that you need a plan B if Janikowski is your kicker   Just to be safe   More as we hear it Joe Bryant Analytics Inc   All Rights Reserved 1999-2001 To unsubscribe from this group send an email to cheatsheets-unsubscribeegroupscom Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to httpdocsyahoocominfoterms

wwwdrudgereportcom  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the real scoop about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind andor financier  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year and it would be in Americas best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------US focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah Arafats Fatah SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNECOM Friday September 14 2001 WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington US defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat the sources said Another group being examined for a link to the US attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah Middle East Newsline reports Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden Sen Charles Grassley the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee said But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah Fatah and other Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by US intelligence agencies since the bombing A US official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups But the official said no determination has been made We want to be sure we understand all the connections not just one connection the official said As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime as we find out who theyre connected with as we find out who could be considered harboring them I think itll come clear Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the US attacks They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon The administration has requested 20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack I dont think we know the breakdown yet partly because the needs are so enormous Wolfowitz said A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness -----Original Message-----From Frank Laura mailtolfrankvignettecom Sent Friday September 14 2001 1002 AM To Michael Wilkes Christine Finch astephenscrushinteractivecom daxcypressmailcom austinassistantclausmancom isaacpradnet Frank Laura lydteryahoocom jmilbrandtsouthwestartcom mucearthlinknet marktasseelnetiqcom mcuillaenroncom tinaobaniongtenet toddgatoryahoocom strangle2000yahoocom zwhartondawraycom Subject RE New WTC A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the government proves he is responsible rather than send hate mail  cause added tension between the two countries Dont be so ignorant  Its UN-American Whoever is responsible will be taken care of -

Afghanistan by a UC Berkeley professor A sobering essay forwarded by a UC Berkeley professor Dear Friends The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary Tamim is an Afghani-American writer He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life When he writes I read When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in -Gary T Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for 35 years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997 Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are 500000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary Get your FREE

epidemiologist Andrea Kim who conducted the study says it and other studies in California and London have shown that gay men are combining Viagra with other drugs much more frequently when compared to heterosexual men and that puts them at higher risk Her sa common side effect of club drugs is loss of erection We know that ecstasy and methamphetamines reduce sexual function so the men are using Viagra to enhance their sexual ability Kim says Partygoers often combine Viagra with amyl nitrite an inhaled stimulant commonly referred to as poppers University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Chief of Toxicology and emergency room physician Dr Daniel Keyes says that amyl nitrite makes the heart race and combining these drugs can cause cardiac events Like Viagra amyl nitrite causes blood vessel dilation and a drop in blood pressure Combining two blood pressure lowering drugs can be fatal if a person has a heart attack or stroke Although rare another medical condition that can occur is

httpwwwheraldnetcomgraphicsspacergif httpwwwheraldnetcomgraphicsspacergif By Brian Kelly Herald Writer CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living police said Wednesday Deputies from the Island County Sheriffs Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old mans home on Maple Tree Lane a dead-end road on the south end of the island The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theaters courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living and he allegedly said he grew marijuana According to a police report the man then asked for the officers help in harvesting the crop The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the mans operation and the naked man agreed In the outbuilding behind the mans mobile home police found what they described as a sophisticated hydroponic grow operation Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants Police said the man seemed proud of his operation telling them that the system used no dirt just lava rock and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer In a written statement to police the man allegedly said I grow marijuana for fun and profit to support myself and my family to help bring us a better life He also said he was growing marijuana for his father who had a disease and for other medically ill people The mans wife told police she had never been inside her husbands shed but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden and the man said he didnt expect them to do anything Police however confiscated the plants and growing equipment The man was cooperative they said even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance but he is not named because charges have not been filed You can call Herald Writer Brian Kelly at 425-339-3422 or send e-mail to kellyheraldnetcom

wwwdrudgereportcom  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the real scoop about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind andor financier  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year and it would be in Americas best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------US focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah Arafats Fatah SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNECOM Friday September 14 2001 WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington US defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat the sources said Another group being examined for a link to the US attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah Middle East Newsline reports Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden Sen Charles Grassley the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee said But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah Fatah and other Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by US intelligence agencies since the bombing A US official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups But the official said no determination has been made We want to be sure we understand all the connections not just one connection the official said As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime as we find out who theyre connected with as we find out who could be considered harboring them I think itll come clear Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the US attacks They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon The administration has requested 20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack I dont think we know the breakdown yet partly because the needs are so enormous Wolfowitz said A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness -----Original Message-----From Frank Laura mailtolfrankvignettecom Sent Friday September 14 2001 1002 AM To Michael Wilkes Christine Finch astephenscrushinteractivecom daxcypressmailcom austinassistantclausmancom isaacpradnet Frank Laura lydteryahoocom jmilbrandtsouthwestartcom mucearthlinknet marktasseelnetiqcom mcuillaenroncom tinaobaniongtenet toddgatoryahoocom strangle2000yahoocom zwhartondawraycom Subject RE New WTC A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the government proves he is responsible rather than send hate mail  cause added tension between the two countries Dont be so ignorant  Its UN-American Whoever is responsible will be taken care of -

wwwdrudgereportcom  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the real scoop about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind andor financier  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year and it would be in Americas best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------US focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah Arafats Fatah SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNECOM Friday September 14 2001 WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington US defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat the sources said Another group being examined for a link to the US attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah Middle East Newsline reports Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden Sen Charles Grassley the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee said But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah Fatah and other Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by US intelligence agencies since the bombing A US official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups But the official said no determination has been made We want to be sure we understand all the connections not just one connection the official said As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime as we find out who theyre connected with as we find out who could be considered harboring them I think itll come clear Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the US attacks They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon The administration has requested 20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack I dont think we know the breakdown yet partly because the needs are so enormous Wolfowitz said A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness -----Original Message-----From Frank Laura mailtolfrankvignettecom Sent Friday September 14 2001 1002 AM To Michael Wilkes Christine Finch astephenscrushinteractivecom daxcypressmailcom austinassistantclausmancom isaacpradnet Frank Laura lydteryahoocom jmilbrandtsouthwestartcom mucearthlinknet marktasseelnetiqcom mcuillaenroncom tinaobaniongtenet toddgatoryahoocom strangle2000yahoocom zwhartondawraycom Subject RE New WTC A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the government proves he is responsible rather than send hate mail  cause added tension between the two countries Dont be so ignorant  Its UN-American Whoever is responsible will be taken care of -

crop httpwwwheraldnetcomgraphicsspacergif httpwwwheraldnetcomgraphicsspacergif By Brian Kelly Herald Writer CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living police said Wednesday Deputies from the Island County Sheriffs Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old mans home on Maple Tree Lane a dead-end road on the south end of the island The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theaters courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living and he allegedly said he grew marijuana According to a police report the man then asked for the officers help in harvesting the crop The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the mans operation and the naked man agreed In the outbuilding behind the mans mobile home police found what they described as a sophisticated hydroponic grow operation Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants Police said the man seemed proud of his operation telling them that the system used no dirt just lava rock and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer In a written statement to police the man allegedly said I grow marijuana for fun and profit to support myself and my family to help bring us a better life He also said he was growing marijuana for his father who had a disease and for other medically ill people The mans wife told police she had never been inside her husbands shed but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden and the man said he didnt expect them to do anything Police however confiscated the plants and growing equipment The man was cooperative they said even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance but he is not named because charges have not been filed You can call Herald Writer Brian Kelly at 425-339-3422 or send e-mail to kellyheraldnetcom

httpwwwtheonioncomonion3731indexhtml 	5 September 2001 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731headgodgivesshout-outgif SOUTH BRONX NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731godgivesshoutoutjpg Above Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God inset Right about now I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga whos shown Me love through the years said the Lord His booming voice descending from Heaven I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz Yall real niggaz out there you know who you are Yall was there for me and its about time Im-a give some love back to Gods true crew All yall niggaz yall be My niggaz the Lord added As of press time God has thanked nearly 7000 of His niggaz including those in New Yorks Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin it down in New Orleans Nelly and the whole St Lunatics crew Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad His peeps from back in the day and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School as well as to Lil Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up Mad props to P Diddy Jay-Z DMX Lil Kim Mystikal Eve Ja Rule Jadakiss Trick Daddy and Xzibit And one love to Meth RZA GZA Ghostface and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan the deity said These My beloved niggaz with whom I be well-pleased Now nearing the 48-hour mark the Lords first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week In addition to raps current stars God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash Busy Bee Melle Mel Jazzy Jay Kool Moe Dee Afrika Bambaataa DJ Red Alert the Cold Crush Brothers Fab 5 Freddy Kurtis Blow Kool Herc and the Funky 41 God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs record labels magazines TV shows and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years Among them are Def Jam Tommy Boy Jive Roc-A-Fella Rap Pages The Source Right On The Box Funkmaster Flex Ed Lover and Dr Dre WBLS 1075 KISS-FM and Hot 97 For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully I say thank you God said All praise to Devante Harrell Wanda Simmons LaShell Thomas and everybody else at UptownMCA for making this possible httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731godgivesshoutoutjumpjpg Above A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community God assured the nations rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven Tupac Notorious BIG Eazy-E Scott LaRock-some of yall niggaz are already up in this bitch the Lord said For those of you who were left behind know that the Lord has got your dead homies backs Faith Evans I promise Im taking real good care of your Biggie He resting in crazy peace no doubt Thus far God has not played favorites thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic DJ Phreek Malik and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them All rappers God explained are equal in His sight and none are too small to escape His notice God sees even the smallest sparrow fall said Dr Cornell West Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion The same is true of MCs Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown all rappers are His children and He loves them all The sheer volume of names notwithstanding the nations rappers are deeply touched by Gods gesture of tribute and appreciation with many stating that they feelin Him God is the Original Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word nigga On Mondays Larry King Live conservative activist Rev Calvin Butts a longtime ally of the Lord blasted Him for His shocking unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word Some concerned parties including decency crusader C Delores Tucker Sen Orrin Hatch R-UT and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children Foundation are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology Reacting to the controversy many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lords defense The word nigga means different things depending on how its used and whos saying it rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said Judging from
