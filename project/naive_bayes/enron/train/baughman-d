displayed on city fire trucks because they didnt want to offend anyone in the  community In an act of tolerance the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all Proud to be an  American signs removed so as to not offend international students I for one am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American citizens and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture  Since the terrorist attacks on September 11 we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the majority of Americans However the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington DC when the  politically correct crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was offending others I am not against immigration nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a  better life by coming to America In fact our countrys population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants however there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our country and  apparently some native Americans need to understand First of  all it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you  in any way This idea of America being a multi-cultural community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity As  Americans we have our own culture our own society our own language  and our own lifestyle This culture called the American Way has been  developed over centuries of struggles trials and victories by millions  of men and women who have sought freedom Our forefathers fought bled  and died at places such as Bunker Hill Antietam San Juan Iwo Jima  Normandy Korea Vietnam We speak English not Spanish Arabic  Chinese Japanese Russian or any other language Therefore if you  wish to become part of our society --learn our language In  God We Trust is our national motto This is not some off-the-wall Christian Right Wing political slogan -- it is our national motto It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency We adopted this motto because Christian  men and women on Christian principles founded this nation and this is  clearly documented throughout our history If it is appropriate  for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools God is in our pledge our National Anthem  nearly every patriotic song and in our founding documents We honor His  birth death and resurrection as holidays and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis If God offends you then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your new home because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms We celebrate Independence Day Memorial Day Veterans Day and Flag Day We  have parades picnics and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag  As an American I have the right to wave my flag sing my national  anthem quote my national motto and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose If the Stars and Stripes offend you or you dont  like Uncle Sam then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet The American culture is our way of life  our heritage and we are proud of it We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change and we really dont care how you did things  where you came from We are Americans like it or not this is our  country our land and our lifestyle Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government culture or society and we will allow you every opportunity to do so But once you are done complaining whining and griping about our flag our pledge our national motto or our way of life I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom the  right to leave Barry Loudermilk If you agree pass this  onto other Americans It is time to take a  stand
