chose Wed  Not that disappointed though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the ML  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than with winning the game  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs at all  If you ask me they dont deserve it and the mgr should be fired It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning  Im sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games Anyway whats up on your front  Are you still going out to Cali to visit Hop and Denise  Hows flying KR -----Original Message-----From Conway Frank P mailtoConwayFPnavairnavymil Sent Friday October 05 2001 812 AM To Ruscitti Kevin Subject RE Last night was the game to catch  Where your seats near where the homer dropped I think the 330 is the better call  You really dont want a BMW as a family car anyway until the kids are much older  I dont know what the prices are but the 330ic is pretty sweet Capt Frank P Conway Sissy USNTPS Class 121 3017575079 conwayfpnavairnavymil -----Original Message-----From Ruscitti Kevin mailtoKevinRuscittiENRONcom Sent Friday October 05 2001 903 AM To Conway Frank P Subject RE Thanks for the advice  Much appreciated  We plan on test driving this weekend  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -I heard its pretty sweet  I have a feeling were going to lean toward the 330i just bc everything Ive read rates it the best in its class I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now wo kids but we should get a better feel this weekend  Ill keep you informed Thanks again KR -----Original Message-----From Conway Frank P mailtoConwayFPnavairnavymil Sent Thursday October 04 2001 227 PM To Ruscitti Kevin Subject RE Drive em both but at least for the older ones the 8 cyl was MUCH smoother  It really comes down to what you want   Unless youre really pushing it you wont notice much of a difference  However what you will notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder ie louder Once you jump into the 5 youre in the luxury market and you probably want a smoother car with plenty of torque 8 cyl  Especially the way you drive not winding the engine out in every gear youll feel more low end power in the 540  Again it comes down to the pax  If youre hauling 2 most of the time the 530 is probably fine hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit Remember when youre on a test drive the car isnt configured the way it will be in real life  The tires will be under inflated the gas tank large in that car like 14 gal 90 pounds and no passengers so your performance will seem better  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range is to insist on an extended overnight or over a weekend test drive of both  You dont want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of weeks later  Finally think about long term kids etc if you plan on hanging onto it as long as the Miata  Its not uncommon for a bimmer to go 2-300000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a while if you stay up on the maintenance  Give me a buzz at home 3017375366 tonight if you want to yap about it Capt Frank P Conway Sissy USNTPS Class 121 3017575079 conwayfpnavairnavymil -----Original Message-----From Ruscitti Kevin mailtoKevinRuscittiENRONcom Sent Thursday October 04 2001 123 PM To Conway Frank P Subject RE What do you think about the 530  Isnt it basically the same thing as the 330 except its bigger  If so does it handle as well with the added size and weight -----Original Message-----From Conway Frank P mailtoConwayFPnavairnavymil Sent Thursday October 04 2001 946 AM To Ruscitti Kevin Subject RE Kev Real quick on the cars  The beamer is real tight in the back seat Think about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people  If you think its a factor spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back Id still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo it might surprise you Capt Frank P Conway Sissy USNTPS Class 121 3017575079 conwayfpnavairnavymil -----Original Message-----From Ruscitti Kevin mailtoKevinRuscittiENRONcom Sent Thursday October 04 2001 1016 AM To Conway Frank P Subject RE I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section 154 It was one of the most disappointing games ive ever attended  the astros dont even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play  the managers an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd with 2 outs Anyway in terms of the Miata the dealer recommended abt 1300 worth of work Of course i told him to just get the thing running 450  The problem is the blue book value is only 2500 so i cant see putting another grand into it Ill probably just sell it to someone who races miatas which is really big in Texas or donate it to charity and take the tax write off We havent test driven anything yet but it looks like were leaning toward the BMW 330i  It seems to get great reviews the main downside is that its a little small - but still sporty  Well go for test drives this weekend and should buy or lease still undecided something in the next couple weeks Hows everything on your front  Less classroom time and more flying time That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend  I dont expect him to call of course but it shows how easily he couldve gotten to Houston while he was working for 8 mos in Dallas Later kevin -----Original Message-----From Conway Frank P mailtoConwayFPnavairnavymil Sent Thursday October 04 2001 840 AM To Ruscitti Kevin Subject RE Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly  I guess its just as well Id hate to find them at 3000 Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata  What happened to it  Cant it be fixed or are you just abandoning it  Where are you leaning in terms of a new car  On my end the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a complete blast to drive Whats with the faggot Astros walking your boy  At least he pocketed one record I dont have TJs email w me but Im sure he never expected you to actually show up in the first place Capt Frank P Conway Sissy USNTPS Class 121 3017575079 conwayfpnavairnavymil -----Original Message-----From Ruscitti Kevin mailtoKevinRuscittiENRONcom Sent Tuesday October 02 2001 903 AM To Conway Frank P Subject RE Conway Do you have TJs new email address  I want to let him know I wont be out there in Oct  Give me a shout  Hows everything going My miata broke down this past weekend  I didnt think it would be that soon  It looks like Im forced to buy a new car  Im not looking forward to the process although the internet should make it less painful than it was 95 years ago  Wow I cant believe Ive owned the Miata for over 9 yrs Im going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night  Hoping hell be going for the record that night either a tie or to break it  I scored tix in section 154 -

section 154 It was one of the most disappointing games ive ever attended  the astros dont even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play  the managers an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd with 2 outs Anyway in terms of the Miata the dealer recommended abt 1300 worth of work Of course i told him to just get the thing running 450  The problem is the blue book value is only 2500 so i cant see putting another grand into it Ill probably just sell it to someone who races miatas which is really big in Texas or donate it to charity and take the tax write off We havent test driven anything yet but it looks like were leaning toward the BMW 330i  It seems to get great reviews the main downside is that its a little small - but still sporty  Well go for test drives this weekend and should buy or lease still undecided something in the next couple weeks Hows everything on your front  Less classroom time and more flying time That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend  I dont expect him to call of course but it shows how easily he couldve gotten to Houston while he was working for 8 mos in Dallas Later kevin -----Original Message-----From Conway Frank P mailtoConwayFPnavairnavymil Sent Thursday October 04 2001 840 AM To Ruscitti Kevin Subject RE Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly  I guess its just as well Id hate to find them at 3000 Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata  What happened to it  Cant it be fixed or are you just abandoning it  Where are you leaning in terms of a new car  On my end the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a complete blast to drive Whats with the faggot Astros walking your boy  At least he pocketed one record I dont have TJs email w me but Im sure he never expected you to actually show up in the first place Capt Frank P Conway Sissy USNTPS Class 121 3017575079 conwayfpnavairnavymil -----Original Message-----From Ruscitti Kevin mailtoKevinRuscittiENRONcom Sent Tuesday October 02 2001 903 AM To Conway Frank P Subject RE Conway Do you have TJs new email address  I want to let him know I wont be out there in Oct  Give me a shout  Hows everything going My miata broke down this past weekend  I didnt think it would be that soon  It looks like Im forced to buy a new car  Im not looking forward to the process although the internet should make it less painful than it was 95 years ago  Wow I cant believe Ive owned the Miata for over 9 yrs Im going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night  Hoping hell be going for the record that night either a tie or to break it  I scored tix in section 154 -
