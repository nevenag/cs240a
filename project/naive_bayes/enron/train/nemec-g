Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Tucker Patrick McCaffrey Deirdre Penman Gregg Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 1114 Here are my notes from todays call  As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets  Core Non-core and Under Review Core  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Non-core  Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS  Enron has approx 8Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review  EGM EIM  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability  Required resource levels are being carefully studied  Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates Approximately 800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter  These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of 500MM-1Bn  Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Short-term liquidity is provided by the 3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the 1Bn of new debt and the 15Bn equity infusion from Dynegy  Longer-term the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets  It was initially capitalized with 950MM of 144a debt and 125MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 31703 the Enron topup obligation  The 31703 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water  As long as Wessex is worth at least 26Bn there will be no Enron topup required  If we take a 25 haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide 650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt  This 650MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energy-related assets and other assets  It was initially capitalized with 24Bn of 144a debt and 220MM in equity ENE and institutionals  As with Marlin the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b 1Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup  Assuming the same 25 hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx 600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash income and equity  The debt must be retired by 91702 with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions  The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our 10Q will be filed five days late  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing  The committee meets 2-3 timesweek sometimes more often  The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually 7 days a week  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for  That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15 of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval  However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year  Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing 19Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is 21Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the 35Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear  The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas  The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels  It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us McMahon  There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers  But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses  Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business  We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon  The company is overlevered thats a fact--hence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx 1Bn in cash as of 930 which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at 3-3055 if youd like more color Patrick Tucker

Sent	Thursday November 08 2001 355 PM To	Nemec Gerald Cc	Dolan Sue Subject	ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreements with PSCo and CLFP Gerald At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado PSCo and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power CLFP  I apologize for the delay  Our comments are as follows Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues  We request in Section 41 that the 20000000 dollar level be applicable to each of our companies  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section 46 be 25000000 as to each of our companies 24 Confirmations  In the second line please change may to shall  We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 221 Transactions 35 Netting and 44 Offset  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts  Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo or CLFP acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction  Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement 41 Early Termination  I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition  I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two 2 nor more than ten 10 Business Days following the date of such notice 42 Triggering Event  In the 8th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated  Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence  Please delete this phrase in the Agreement 41 and 45 References to Affiliates  In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections 41 and 45 reference is made to Affiliates  For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies  Moreover neither PSCo nor CLFP is authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLFP in the respective Agreements Article 5 Force Majeure  The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period  The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to 60 Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement  In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction  This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section 81 Notices  Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section 82  Transfer  We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section 83  Limitation of Remedies  We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use  The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended  Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions  The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day confirm deadline rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition  We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change  This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating  Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured long-term senior debt of such Party 	or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB- or its equivalent by Standard  Poors or below Baa3 or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc 	provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any unsecured long-term senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard  Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a 	Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness 	financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection 	herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential  Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated above regarding the PSCo Agreement with the following exceptions Section 42 Triggering Event  The dollar levels near the end of the Section should be equivalent between our companies  Please make each 75000000 Section 47  Collateral Requirement  Similarly the dollar trigger levels in this provision should be equivalent between our companies  Please make each 25000000 Except for the foregoing please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration  I look forward to working with you to finalize these Agreements Alan Bransgrove Manager Contract

June 25 2001 806 AM To	Knippa Mark Cc	Hilgert Chris jgillhanovercocom Subject	RE EnronHanover Mark The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction of which Hanover shall invoice The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents youll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor Additionally Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs which keep this transaction as an operating leaseoff balance sheet transaction This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction Id be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns  Knippa Mark MarkKnippaENRONcom 062201 0352PM  Not sure I get the picture  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station equipment packaging  installation  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation bumper to bumper for the 10 year term of the agreement What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services delivery use  operation insurance the return of equipment etc that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover  Is ECS expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform mk   -----Original Message----- From 	Stam John CAP CEF JohnStamgecapitalcomENRON
