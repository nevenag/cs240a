Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers mailtocberthelsensfchroniclecom Sunday May 20 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright URL httpwwwsfgatecomcgi-binarticlecgifca20010520MN121438DTL Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14990 megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for the ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the 1046-megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market They and other power companies including AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a 10-minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price would go up Then if the schedule was at 70 required megawatt hours of output theyd say Go up to 90 That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again  Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like 80 minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a so-called 10-minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies Plants owned by Reliant AES Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the states total capacity from all sources Reliant one of Californias largest and most profitable out-of-state generators reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April It was followed by Mirant Corp of Atlanta 310 AES Corp of Arlington Va 278 and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte NC 261 Reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53000 megawatts over the 40-day period an average of 1368 per day - enough power for 14 million homes for one hour Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard with one generating unit down for 26 days accounted for more than 30000 of those missed megawatts However an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair They are old At 48 Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliants five California plants And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut One problem at Etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem Moreover at the time of the shutdown the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online the operators said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently The scheduling calls came from Dynegys trading floor in Houston rather than NRG in Minneapolis he said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market In a May 2000 report the California Energy Commission cited Reliants Etiwanda plant as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high real-time prices that spring One way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met On one occasion one operator said Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of 1000 per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was 750 The operator said Its our unit shut it off  the source said E-mail Christian Berthelsen at cberthelsensfchroniclecom mailtocberthelsensfchroniclecom and Scott Winokur at swinokursfchroniclecom
