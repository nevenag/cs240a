We have received a termination notice from Ameren, which is one of the counterparties identified by David for resuming scheduling of power.  Let me know if you would like a copy of the notice.

Diane,
Below is a list of gas trades that were originally between Columbia Energy Services and ENA, which Settlements is trying to reconcile.  CES says they are not their trades, and they do not appear to be part of the trades that were assigned from CES to New Power.  Can you give me anymore information on them?

Thanks.

FYI -

I received a call from Ryan Youngblood of Kona Ltd. (281-820-7889) requesting the return of the letter of credit Kona posted to ENA in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement.
