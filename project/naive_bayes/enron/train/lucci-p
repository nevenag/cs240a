about the CU 30 yard line  We had a first down and were going for it when we fumbled  and they took it back for a touchdown  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I dont even know what  Im headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field  I havent been to Kyle Field in ages so Im really looking forward to it Petrogulfs agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery points except Opal until the expansion is in place  These other points would include QGM MGR OTTCO and QPL  Its a bit curious to me that they would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20 to get there  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option so maybe this is not a true current option  Cant Petrogulf tell you this stuff  Its not my place to do it and the only reason I am is because youre going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner kidding As for dinner yes Im still available  As for the place dont feel like you need to drop a bunch of cash although cash is thrilling isnt it Im happy eating just about anything  Im trying to be on a new health kick so healthy fare sounds appealing  My only condition is that I cant stay out late because I have a 530am appointment at the gym with my trainer Thurs am  Its brutal  I leave the house at 5am  Want to stay downtown or venture out kt

in the mean time before the great expansion do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points  I think they can take their gas in kind at QuestarBird Canyon but Im not sure And finally are you still available for dinner Wednesday night  I just got paid so Im looking to take you some place nice  Yes I am bribing you Paul -----Original Message-----From Karen L

to watch it at a sports bar and needless to say I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd  We had a chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes  We had driven the ball from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line  We had a first down and were going for it when we fumbled  and they took it back for a touchdown  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I dont even know what  Im headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field  I havent been to Kyle Field in ages so Im really looking forward to it Petrogulfs agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery points except Opal until the expansion is in place  These other points would include QGM MGR OTTCO and QPL  Its a bit curious to me that they would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20 to get there  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option so maybe this is not a true current option  Cant Petrogulf tell you this stuff  Its not my place to do it and the only reason I am is because youre going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner kidding As for dinner yes Im still available  As for the place dont feel like you need to drop a bunch of cash although cash is thrilling isnt it Im happy eating just about anything  Im trying to be on a new health kick so healthy fare sounds appealing  My only condition is that I cant stay out late because I have a 530am appointment at the gym with my trainer Thurs am  Its brutal  I leave the house at 5am  Want to stay downtown or venture out kt
