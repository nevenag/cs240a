What is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers 
are coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.

Later for now
The Looch

So what's up with you?   I hear that your company is going through a little change to put in mildly......
 
So you are still set from what Mike told me.    Dang it..... I guess you're still the rich one and I'm the pretty one..... I guess I can't be both...
 
So how is everything else? Still up for a ski trip????? I sure hope so. I don't know which I look forward to more, the ski trip or Vegas baby......   Snow Skiing is my favorite sport type activity.... unless you count Olympic "Belly wrestling"..... But the trip to Vegas was fun.....Sun and fun- plus the women are wearing less.
 
Check out the new bed I made for my guest room. I sold the last bed.  I hope Mike won't break this bed with his big women action... Oh sorry that's Brian that likes the "Full figured" women.
 
Later Heavy-D

We ARE working!  But we don't know if we are getting paid.  We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.  But after that who knows?  They are laying off over 80% in Houston.  We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.  
 
What did you do this weekend?  Did you go out with your "friend" JP?

Bob,

This week I pick the Colts!  I'm meeting Karen tonight for dinner, so I'll tell you how that goes.  She made a comment about you yesterday, your name came up and she said "that Bob."  I said "I thought you and Bob were friends."  And she said "Oh that Bob!"  So I figure she's mad at you for, you know the "twins."  Anyway I won't say anything, so don't worry.  We moved the happy hour to next Friday 26th, so you better be there.
Maybe even "Cool River."  

Paul

I'd LOVE to be your personal assistant.  What would you like me to do first? 
  Saturday night is looking rough because my daughter Brigette, leaves for 
Sea Camp on Sunday morning, for an entire week.  Any possibility that you 
may come to the cocktail party on Friday?  Today kinda sucks, but it's

I would LOVE to meet for lunch on Wednesday!  I am so bored and lonely 
today, glad you shot me an e-mail.  Planning to go to the club later tonight 
so hopefully I'll be in prime hot tub condition!  I know I keep bugging you, 
but I can't help it.  I feel so completely isolated at times and I just keep 
reaching out.  Hope you don't mind coddling me every now and again.  I had 
such a great time last friday when I came into town for the so called 
"interview".  So nice to meet new people and hang out.  Can't wait to come 
to work with everyone, it seems like a great office.  Ready to get into an 
early morning workout regime as well, but mostly I just want something to 
fill my day.  Don't I sound pathetic today...yuck!

Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year old white male, resident of
Wimbledon, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 pm Friday. Davidson will be
charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public
intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday.

The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he
decided to stop. "You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and
there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there
wasn't," he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road,
picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a
hole in it and proceeded to satisfy his alleged "need". "I guess I was
just really into it, you know?" he commented with evident embarrassment.


In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wimbledon
Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until
officer Brenda Taylor approached him. "It was an unusual situation,
that's for sure," said officer Taylor. "I walked up to (Davidson) and
he's...just working away at this pumpkin." Taylor went on to describe
what happened when she approached Davidson.

"I just went up and said, "Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you
are screwing a pumpkin?" He got real surprised as you'd expect and then
looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it
midnight already?"

Hell No!  Ever since last weekend when you made up some bogus excuse about having to celebrate Natalie's birthday and not being able to party with me, I've been sulking!  What's up for the weekend.  Here's what I have going on; Friday Night-Office Christmas Party, Saturday Night-Hot Tubing with random chicks (any interest?).

Hey baby!  I just love it when your little messages "pop" up.  I don't know 
if Mark's made up his mind yet, but I have a pretty good feeling about it.  
If (when) I officially have the job, you ought to take me out to lunch, 
seeing how you'd be one of my big, bad bosses!  Not to mention, I'm reduced 
to a poor working woman again.  Is there a dress code in the office?  What 
are your plans for later this week?

Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.  Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.  Thenw eeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).  If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.

Jay,
 
We are looking to transact with this customer on a two year index purchase.  I need to discuss the details with you, but in the mean time here are the financials that they have provided.  Take a close look at them and realize this is a very rich man and he can have very bad things done to you.  So, let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements.

Guys,

Looks like Will & Paul will be arriving @ DFW around the same time on Friday.
Gonzalo was planning on picking up Paul and I think Rob's going to pick up Will,
perhaps you might want to consolidate and have 1 person pick up both Paul & Will, just
a thought.

I'm just throwing this out as an idea, but you guys work out all the details.  I have to be home between
1:00 - 4:00 for the margarita machine delivery, so I won't be able to pick anyone up.

Paul's Info:
Airline: United
Flt #:  1670
Time: 1:00 pm 

Paul's Pager:     888.773.1942
Paul'sMobile: 303.810.5708


Will's Info:
Airline:  Continental
Flt #:  3801
Time: 2:34 pm
Will's Mobile: 757.589.7180

Gonzalo's Cell Phone:

Rob's Cell Phone:

See you guys Friday.  Please get fresh haircuts and shower before you arrive on Friday; and as always dress to impress.

Later,
Michael

Paul,

I hope you're kidding, but you should probably go get your stuff
checked just in case.  While you're at it you might want to get the prostate
checked too; depending
on your doctor is can actually be a great experience.  My doctor is a hot
blonde female with long
skinny fingers.  Oh I think I'm feeling sick and should go see her again
soon!

Lesson learned, "If you're not going to sack it, take it home and wack it."

Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
  at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
  gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

 The question posed by St. Peter is - "What is Easter"?

 The first blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful."

 "Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - "What is Easter?"

 The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, "Do YOU know
  what Easter is?"

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, "I
  know what Easter is."

 "Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 "Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder."

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... "Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

Hello you guys,
 
Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!  You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.  Anyway I hope you're doing fine.  I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.  I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.  The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.  The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.  There are people flying in from all over the country.  Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.  It's a big pain but obliviously needed.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Go UT!
 
Paul
 
PS  We haven't found a place in Vail, but we are still looking!

The concert was great!  We had box seats so we drank for free, which is always a plus.  As far as Enron goes we definitely need this Dynegy deal!  What's up with you this weekend?  We are going to the wine tasting thing on Saturday, right?  What about Friday night want to play doctor?

Just wanted to see how the concert was and find out what you think about 
Dynegy possibly buying out Enron.  Is that a good or bad thing, or does it 
even matter?

Zen Quotations:
1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.
..........Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not
..........follow. Do not walk beside me, either.
.........Just leave me the hell alone.

2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with
..........a broken fan belt and a leaky tire.

3. It's always darkest before dawn, so if you're
..........going to steal your neighbor's newspaper,
..........that's the time to do it.

4. Sex is like air. It's not important unless you
..........aren't getting any.

5. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced,

..........Just like everyone else.

7. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.

8. It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply

9. It is far more impressive when others discover
..........your good qualities without your help.

10. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try
..........missing a couple of car payments.

11. Before you criticize someone, you should walk
..........a mile in their shoes. That way, when you
..........criticize them, you're a mile away and you
..........have their shoes.

12. If at first you don't succeed,
..........skydiving is not for you.

13. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.

19. Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.

20. Good judgment comes from bad experience,
..........and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.

21. The quickest way to double your money is to
..........fold it in half and put it in your pocket.

22. Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome
..........of a rain dance.

23. A closed mouth gathers no foot.

24. Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side &

          together.

25. There are two theories to arguing with women.
..........Neither one works.

26. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much
..........when your mouth is moving.

On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.

Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing.  It's that simple.  Anyway as for dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if that's too late we can meet earlier.  The only thing I know that is healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big thing for you.  Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open. I'll eat anything except for Thai.  

The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.  The guy I used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.  Since I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.  But I'm sure you already know this about my personality.  I'm really not trying to BS you with my emotional side.  I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar, if you believe that to be the case. All those other delivery points need processing arrangements.  Don't tell Richard Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!

Subject: RE:



Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option, so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to stay
downtown or venture out?

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I
didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and
CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in
Austin this weekend.

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion,
do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline
delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at
Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just
got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing
you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months),
Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I
can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta
that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
"That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

"Thanks," the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

"Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster."

The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Good morning.  Just wanted to say thanks again for dinner last night.  I
had fun.

4:30 came early this morning.  It always does.  Of course I didn't make it
to bed until 10:30 again so I only got 6 hours of sleep.  Makes for a "many

Will call you tomorrow to let you know when/where we'll be.

Paul,

I do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as Glen Rock is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.  We are currently trying to do these sort of Index deals for the winter and one year time periods.  Anything after that is anyone's guess.  If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.  Hope all is well, and watch out for CU!

Ruth,

Here is the amendment to the purchase contract, please look it over.  It contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the CIG Index piece if there are additional future opportunities.  I will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have.


Paul

Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in Austin this weekend.  

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion, do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.  

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months), Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity


Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

Based on your concerns and requests for additional notice prior to
commissioning each additional segment, we are adopting the following
procedure for placing segments in service:

We will notify you when we have filed each segment with FERC for approval.
Based on our experience with the tie-ins to date, we are now anticipating 4
days for approval.  Upon receiving FERC approval, we will notify you of the
contract in service date for that segment of capacity. The contract will
start at the later of the following dates:  1) two days following the date
of FERC approval; 2) 4 days following filing with FERC; or 3) at least one
week following the last in service date.

For example, we officially filed for the second segment approval (61
Mdth/day) September 25 (today) and anticipate filing the next segment (79
Mdth/day) on October 1.  If we receive FERC approval tomorrow, we will
notify you, but the contract will not become effective until Sept 29.
However, you would have additional capacity available a couple days early at
$.1434.

Hopefully, the above procedure will help you to plan for your nominations by
providing more flexability and notice for each additional commissioning.
Please call me to discuss or with any questions.

Laine Lobban

After I got you message I blew off the trip downtown.  Instead I watched football and worked around the house.  I was able to get a couple things done that have been left undone for awhile, so it was worth it.  You are leaving town for a couple of weeks?  Where are you going?  I'm free every daye xcept Wednesday.

I'm looking forward to Saturday, thanks for inviting me!  Since you don't want to be the first person at the party you can kill time by giving me a tour of your house.  I printed the email that has all the information, so I'll plan on calling you sometime Saturday and then meeting you at your house at 5:00.  Let's talk Saturday, here's my home phone number (303) 469-6768, and my cell (303) 810-5708.  Should we bring anything?

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Wyoming was great and it was good to see YOU at the game.  What do you mean about odds?

Here is the latest on our search for a new condo.  Search Over!  Due to the recent drastic fall in the Enron stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.  So we will have to look for a place to stay.  Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.  We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.   I'll start looking for leads on housing.  I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.  Keep me posted on everything.

H i Michael, good to rear from you.How are you and the guys doing?Did you pratice enough to ski with us again?Ii t will be great to meet you again.

In despite to be insane  thinking in traveling to USA at this moment, we are buyin our tikets this week and also hiding our passports so our parents will not forbt us to ski.Everybody says we are crazy and we are,crazy for ski...

We will be in Vail from feb 16 till march 3,the first week we will be in an apartament and then we will move to another place, probably in Eeagle,25 miles from Vail were I know a small hotel very cheap

How  the life is going on with all this mess? Are you affraid?

I hope you can set-up the dates ,it is so nice to meet someone and keep seeing even living so far.See you soon, take care,P

When I first saw the picture I did think it had a chance of being real, until everyone else said it was a knock off.  I was a little puzzled as to how anyone found the camera.  So at least I had my doubts.  So you want to stay in Calgary another year?

I hope you didn't buy it the first time around.  

We've been having meetings the last couple of days on our Canadian Hunter acquisition.  It's all very exciting.  It will probably mean I
stay here a little longer which is good with me.  I have more friends here now than I did when I was in Houston so I'd like to stay a while
longer.

I'm going home for my 15 year high school reunion this weekend - should be interesting.

What's new with you?

No need to apologize! I figured you were busy doing something.  We did not go skiing yesterday, it seems that even though we are in a period of "No Work" something always comes up and needs to be done immediately.  I will be around tonight.  I would of tried you later Monday night but I didn't get back to my house until after nine and last night I was at the Nuggets' game watching the San Antonio Spurs, my hometown team, have their way with the Nuggets.  I'll call you after 8:00 pm MST.  If it works tonight great if not I'll keep trying.  You can fill me in on your job.

Hey Paul-- 

OK, first, I'm sorry I missed your call Mon night--I was looking forward to talking to you! Secondly, sorry I didn't follow up your call with an email... It's been sort of a strange week in that I thought it was going to be really slow, but then have been busy not only during the day, but have had work obligations every evening, too--including this evening. While I'm usually happy to go home, I'll be particularly so this week. I just can't believe that Christmas is next week already. Ugh. 

Did you make it up skiing yesterday? If so, where'd you go? How was the snow?  While it did snow last weekend, it didn't start until Sat afternoon and we went back to Denver Sat night--in the midst of the snowstorm--so really didn't get to enjoy any of the fresh snow... just the headaches it caused. 

I'm glad to hear that at least your boss is optimistic about your future options...I'm less so about my own future, but at least being unemployed now would mean more time on the slopes. 

In any case, I have a dinner this evening with my team, but should be home (hotel home) around 10ishEST. If you're around this evening,  maybe we could try to talk then?  I'm dying to hear your theories on Elvis... 

:-)

Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting. I thought about you this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow on Saturday night. I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow. There isn't anything going on around here and probably won't be for awhile. Our boss was here Friday night for our Christmas party. He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new deal. So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening. I'm looking forward to the conversation. Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.) Solutions for solving world hunger
2.) Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on this on! e)
3.) NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.) Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child

What's up you two losers, and I mean losers!  Anyway, since I have to take time out of my busy schedule and lower myself to your standards here is my itinerary so pay close attention.

I arrive Friday October 5th
	Airline:  United
	Flight:	1478
	Airport:  DFW
	Time:	2:21 pm (arrive Dallas)

I leave Sunday at 12:50 pm

I booked two rooms at the Holiday Inn Express, they are in my name but are not paid for yet.  I'll give them a credit card when I get there.  One of the rooms has a King only and the other room has two beds but it's a smoking room, that's all they had.  So smoke um if you got um!  Both rooms have an additional pull out bed, FYI.  I'm looking forward to this weekend, go UT!!!!!!!!!!

Is 4:45 OK?  Take 128th over to Washington and go North on Washington 
to 136th.  East on 136th to High Street (I think it is the 3rd right) 
Take a right on High street and go to your third street, 135th Ave 
(the development is called the Meadows at Hunters Glen)  and take 
another right.  My address is 1825 E 135th Ave. It is like 8 houses

Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile. 
      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say "Superior? Where's That?" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone.

 The Weakest link'
 ..

 Are you the weakest link???

 I am going to ask you three questions.

 And you have to answer them instantly.

 You can't take your time.

 You have to answer immediately.

 O.K.?  Don't  cheat.

 Let's find out just how clever you really are

 ........... ........

 Ready?

 ..

 GO !!!!!

 ..

 First Question

 ..

 You are participating in a race. You overtake the second place runner.

 What position do you finish?

 ...

 NOW! See the answer below..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Answer

 ..

 If you answered that you finish first, you are absolutely wrong!!!

 Why? Because when you overtake the second place runner and

 you take his place, you finish in second place!!

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 To answer the second question, don't take as much time as you

 took for the first question.

 ..

 ..

 Second Question:   If you overtake the last runner then you arrive...?

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Answer: If you answer that you arrived second to last, you are wrong
again.

                   Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST runner !!!!

                   The question is wrong!

                You're not very good at this are you???

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Third Question

 ..

 Subject: *Very, very tricky math!

 Note:   This riddle must be done IN YOUR HEAD ONLY

                and NOT using paper and a pen.

 ..

 Try it.

 ..

 Take 1000 and add 40 to it.

 Now add another 1000.

 Now add 30.

 Add another 1000.

 Now add 20.

 Now add another 1000.

 Now add 10.

 ..

 What is the total? (scroll down for answer)

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Did you get 5000?

 ..

 The correct answer is actually 4100.

 ..

 Don't believe it? Check it with your calculator!

 ..

 The decimal sequence confuses our brain that always jumps to the

 highest decimals (100s instead of 10s).

 ..

 This should have you in a bad mood for the rest of the day!!!

 ..

 You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

 ..

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so I think you may get
a better price if you wait.  Are you wearing Jeans tonight.

Jack Vaughn is in our office right now.  He just walked into my office

said (like always) "Hey, Gorgeous!  Wow, that's a great color for your

it
is often difficult for a woman to be taken seriously in this industry.

Is Enron stock a good buy at $8?

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."

I can't believe it!  Why?  Well good luck in whatever you do.  It's always been a pleasure to work with you and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  You should look to come skiing now that you have some time off.

Take Care

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

Hey,

It has been brought to my attention that the waivers has not been working
correctly all the time so I have it set up now so that you can pick up
playersTuesday through Saturday but it will rank each day individually.  I
have to approve all adds or drops which I will do every evening.  if more
than one team gose after a player then it will go to the team with the worst
record and then with the least amount of points.  If you have any other
questions let me know.  

Thanks,

Scott

Good morning!  another busy day at the office.  i almost bagged the gym
today to sleep in, but dragged my butt out of bed at the last moment and
went in to do cardio.  i have been a machine lately at the gym.  I think
I've worked out every day except two in the last couple of weeks.  tomorrow
will be another early morning with my trainer.  Did some volunteer work
with the junior league last night for a couple hours.  we did some crafts
with the families over at Warren Village, a single parent housing project.
It was eye-opening, to say the least.  I need that every once in a while as
a reality check on my "charmed life".  Have been working furiously to make
arrangements to fly to Asia for the holidays.  Plan to fly to Hong Kong,
then spend Christmas in Vietnam and New Year's in Shanghai.  All this is
last minute, so it's costing a bloody fortune, but it should be
spectacular.  wish i had saved up $$prior to making this decision.  now my
camera is broken so i'm trying to possibly buy a new one before the trip.
i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm broke and will be going into
debt unless i decide to sell some stock (at a loss).  Got any Enron stock
on ya?  kidding.

Saw Larry Bevins last week at Marlowe's and he gushed on and on about what
a great guy you are.  I didn't believe a word he said, but I'm wondering
how much you're paying him.  Or perhaps other favors are exchanged?

Definitely up for a drink tomorrow after work.  will call later.

Hey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!   I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.  I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.  But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.

Thanks Again

Paul

Subject: Enron Greeley Contracts


Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald?  We need to get these contracts signed.
I am having problems reconciling with Thersa's invoices.  I have paid the
amount reflected on the invoices even through I did not agree for April,
May, June, and July.  I short paid the August invoice.  This is not a good
situation to be in without a contract.  I am not sure where Greeley and
Enron stand with each other especially in light of the difficulties I am
having reconciling the invoices.  
I do not want either party(Greeley or Enron) to find themselves in a
situation that would end up in arbitration.  Talking on the phone or
exchanging worksheets has not proved to be the most efficient way to settle
these differences.  Do you have any sugestions on how we can get the
contracts executed and the invoices reconciled before the deal terminates at
the end of October?   


Thanks...Robert

Paul, 

If you can't find Amy and/or the PSCo invoice, could you just call Lori VanWest (303- 571-7861) at the pipeline and have her fax the invoice and measurement data again?  She could probably do that right away.

Hello!  Just wondering what you're up to the rest of the week?  I've got my company x-mas party on Friday downtown at the Hyatt, and need to kill some time before the party.  Are you up for a couple of drinks after work?  I have to tell you I had a dream about you last night.  YES, you were a cowboy!  I rode you like a...Just kidding!  No the real story is you decided on a new "look".  You showed up in wranglers, boots and hat, and best of all a RED flannel shirt!  It was hilarious.  OK, OK it was just a dream, and I won't tell anyone.

Subject: My life


Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban
719-520-4344
719-331-3379 (cell)

That's so weird, I'm been running around the office all day today yelling; we're done, we're done. But only for a different reason.  Do you want your old job   back?  Congrat's on school.  Come down here and buy us a drink!

I'm done!!  I'm all done!!  Remember when I left you guys a message after
having my eyes done?  Well this is the same feeling.  It's just so great, I
had to share it with all of you.  It's a tremendous feeling.  I can't stop
smiling.  Thanks for all your help on my many little projects for school.

Talk to you guys later.  Take care,

Guys,

Looks like Will & Paul will be arriving @ DFW around the same time on Friday.
Gonzalo was planning on picking up Paul and I think Rob's going to pick up Will,
perhaps you might want to consolidate and have 1 person pick up both Paul & Will, just
a thought.

I'm just throwing this out as an idea, but you guys work out all the details.  I have to be home between
1:00 - 4:00 for the margarita machine delivery, so I won't be able to pick anyone up.

Paul's Info:
Airline: United
Flt #:  1670
Time: 1:00 pm 

Paul's Pager:     888.773.1942
Paul'sMobile: 303.810.5708


Will's Info:
Airline:  Continental
Flt #:  3801
Time: 2:34 pm
Will's Mobile: 757.589.7180

Gonzalo's Cell Phone:
512.627.8405
webb@cisaustin.org

Rob's Cell Phone:

See you guys Friday.  Please get fresh haircuts and shower before you arrive on Friday; and as always dress to impress.

Later,
Michael

Hey Jack needs to only talk to me.  And, what color are you wearing?  I would hold on Enron stock for now.  I think it is a long term buy but I don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so I think you may get a better price if you wait.  Are you wearing Jeans tonight.

is often difficult for a woman to be taken seriously in this industry.

Is Enron stock a good buy at $8?

Barry,

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;



Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.


I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.

Paul

Beer is fine with me.  So you have to drive Greg around all day Saturday.  That should be a perfect time to talk to him about his wife's fondness with other men.  And since Russ is going to the party will there be a fight?  This party is going to be exciting!

What do you want to drink?  I think Greg (Corinnes husband) is 
getting a Keg, Scotch and alot of wine!  I have wine and Vodka at my 
house (gotta have a pre-party cocktail), so if you want something 
else tell me now!!  Other than that, I am bringing Brie, and I think 
that will cover our part.  If you can't get ahold of me Saturday 
afternoon, call my cell, because Greg cannot drive and I have to take 
him on some errands for the party.

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

I thought you might appreciate the following article in Energyfax.  Read Ken Lay - Honest Man.  Apparently overstating earnings and misstating financials for years while at the same time exercising options and making yourself over $100 million is a sign of virtue.

Hi,

I did make the cut and I'm one of the three, in fact I've got to stay around for a certain period of time before Enron will let me go.  I think I'll stay put through the holidays and then see what happens during the first part of January.  I hope your flight went well!  It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday and cold and snowy on Saturday.  Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.

Paul

Hey-- 

Well, as far as I know, the phone number works! :-)  Talking next week would be fine. I'll be back in Philly as of Sun evening. ie: EST, 2 hours ahead of Denver :-) 

I'm not sure if I should be offering my congratulations or not, you failed to mention whether you were one of the 3 who made the final cut... regardless, you sound like you're hanging in there. 

I'm sitting in the airport, on my way home and thrilled to be doing so. 

Talk to you later!

Hey,

Thanks for the phone number, I hope it works! It's a little crazy for me this weekend also. Why don't I call you during the first part of next week and see if we can set something up. What time zone will you be in?

As far as the job goes, three in this office made the final cut. So we are waiting around for our next set of orders. I'll explain more later. Take care.

Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days November 3 - 4; if over-deliveries become a problem during this period, PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback to PSCo for gas days November 3 - 4.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Subject: Enron Greeley Contracts


Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald?  We need to get these contracts signed.
I am having problems reconciling with Thersa's invoices.  I have paid the
amount reflected on the invoices even through I did not agree for April,
May, June, and July.  I short paid the August invoice.  This is not a good
situation to be in without a contract.  I am not sure where Greeley and
Enron stand with each other especially in light of the difficulties I am
having reconciling the invoices.  
I do not want either party(Greeley or Enron) to find themselves in a
situation that would end up in arbitration.  Talking on the phone or
exchanging worksheets has not proved to be the most efficient way to settle
these differences.  Do you have any sugestions on how we can get the
contracts executed and the invoices reconciled before the deal terminates at
the end of October?   


Thanks...Robert

Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.  Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.  Then weeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).  If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.

I was in Wyoming Monday/Tuesday of this week.  Just got your messages.
Toured the Jonah Field (essentially four big compressor stations plus the
JT plant) and the Opal plant.  It was very cool to see everything and meet
some of the operations people out there.  They are fun to hang out with.

As for my weekend, it was good.  I had a group of friends over Saturday
night.  I cooked for everyone and we had margaritas.  I made homemade
salsa, chicken enchiladas, a salad and then creme brulee for desert.  I
rarely cook, so I know two of my friends just came out of curiosity.
Sunday I did yard work then went on a bike ride at the park with my friend
Rene.  We only rode about 17 miles, but I hadn't been on my bike in quite
awhile and I think I felt every single mile.
Talk to you soon.

Paul & Stan

Here is our purchase proposal we have been sending out for renewal on our purchase agreements.  We have left it somewhat open ended to account for differences in the individual gas packages.  Please review this proposal, as I will be calling you shortly to discuss any changes or questions you have to the proposal.  You can reach me at (303) 575-6474.

Hey you back!
 
I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.  Don't take it for anything other than I was very busy.  I have no problem being friends and even getting together, whenever.
Right now I'm in a position in my life where I just want to do what I want to do, I know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how I feel.  I think after you get through with all the BS that's going on in your life you will understand where I'm coming from.  So for now don't take anything I do personally, and feel free to call whenever you want.  And, yes I wuld like to get together.....
 
Paul
And you too have a great day!!!

Hey You!!!
 
I don't usually do the e-mail thing but I am tonight....
 
Listen I felt a little strange talking with you the other
day....you seemed a bit stoic or maybe a bit too business
like.....Is everything ok with you??  I realize you are very 
busy right now after coming back from a lot of time off....
But it did feel strange......
 
I just want you to know that I did not call to get together
with you I just called to see how you where doing....I seems
to me that you felt obligated to tell me that we would get
together sometime.....Don't do that.....Really I just need 
a friend sometimes to chat with....I realize I can be quite 
hard to get along with and not real appealing at those times..
 
So I guess my bottom line is that I think you are a great person
inside and you are a blast to be with.....It would be great to
get together with you just to have some fun....but please
don't feel obligated ..........
 
Anyway, I am not sure if I got my point across or not but
it would be nice to hear from you...
 
Always........
 
Robyn


See Ya
Have a Great Day!!!!

This is a Gas Daily call deal.  The deal is still alive and underway.  The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.  Please get with Tyrell Harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.

Thanks
Paul

Gentlemen,

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."

So, if I have made payment under this plan will these new CD's I've ordered be free even though they have initially been accessed a charge?  Can you just check my account to see how this new order will effect it.  Is there any way you can provide me with a phone number to speak to someone?

Hello,

Thanks for sending me an email.  I appreciate the interest and found your profile to be interesting as well.  But, I feel I'm at a disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a picture.  Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to what you look like?  Drop me a line and we can hash this out.

Hi - I'll be honest - I thought you were cute.  Hopefully you are as interesting as you are attractive :)  

Take a look at my profile and send me an e-mail if you'd like.  Hope to hear from you!

The following is my profile text:

I never thought I'd be using a "dating service". But I'm open to trying new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.

You are not bothering me and I will tell you if you are.  Your right I don't like to gab on the phone for long periods of time, but I like talking to you. I like to keep everything short and sweet. So, tell me when I'm going to see you again.  You will miss the big Limo party on Saturday.  Too bad the car is full.  And, even with a bad ankle I can still dance.

Just wanted to say hello.  I have much more free time on my hands than you, 
so you have to tell me if I am bothering you too much.  I like your 
attention, even though you are obviously not a phone man.  Get your ankle 
checked out so that you can take me dancing again!

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Hello!
I'm a fun, 33 year old Boulder native, CU grad and work in advertising.  I'm funny, independent and outgoing.  I love my life but desire to have someone to share it with, now since most of my friends are married and starting to have children.  It makes the social opportunities less available and spontanious...I'm sure you can relate.

I love my life and own my own place in Boulder which I share with my adored dog, Buddy.  I'm a huge Buff fan and wish I could go to the Fiesta Bowl for new years.

WHat about you?  WHere did you go to school?  Do you love working in Denver?  The social scene is so great!  Lots to do, great restaurants, fun bars.  I worked there prior to taking my job here in Boulder...I really miss it.

Anyhow, I hope you are having fun and a good repsonse from your ad.  You have a great smile and eyes!  I hope to hear back from you so I can learn more about you!

Take Care,
C

What about me picking two winning teams last weekend.  Can you send me the latest updated version of the pool.  Also what about lunch later this week so I can get you your money.  Tell Larry we are going to party Friday, so he better go along.

The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.  Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!

Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!

Hey Looch!!

Funny e-mail.   What's the latest at Enron?   Have you heard anything that
could affect your status here in the Denver office?  I sure hope
not....unless its good news of course.

Jared is done with football and has already moved onto basketball.   His
first game was last night in Limon.   We lost 45-27 but I think his team has
potential.   They should do ok.

What's new with you?

LB

I have a customer in town Thursday night, so we will be taking him out to dinner, than to the Nuggets game.  I still want, and I'm planning, to go to the concert on Friday night, so don't count me out.  We will have to do dinner some other time.  Make sure we talk on Friday because I have an open house from 3:00 to 6:00, and I'll start drinking and forget the plans.  How is everything else going.  I had a GREAT time on Saturday night, so I hope you did also.

Hi  Paul. How are you?  Just trying to plan the rest of my week.  Are we still on for dinner?  I've got my final flag-football game tonight, happy hour tomorrow night, and the 38-Special concert on Friday night, so Thursday night is the only night that really works for me.  Do you still want to go to the concert Friday?  Yes, the puker will be there!  Let me know.  Bye for now.
 
Lisa

Don't worry he has made up his mind so no matter what I say I can't change it.  What are you doing later this week?  Now that you have a job you can take me out.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Glad to here it! 

This may sound a little dramatic, but if there's anything I can do to help
you , please count on me to help.   You've been a terrific friend to me a
time when I really needed help this past year.  You're not the type of
person who expects a lot in return, but always know your generosity was...as
is...appreciated.   You're a good person.    (Regardless of what the rest of
the industry thinks of you!!!)        ...............just kidding.

Thanks for all your help and promise you'll call on me if you ever need help
in the future.

The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they
want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will
take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think
anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.
Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!

Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met

Hey Looch!!

Funny e-mail.   What's the latest at Enron?   Have you heard anything
that
could affect your status here in the Denver office?  I sure hope
not....unless its good news of course.

Jared is done with football and has already moved onto basketball.   His
first game was last night in Limon.   We lost 45-27 but I think his team
has
potential.   They should do ok.

What's new with you?

Many of you, I know, will appreciate this.


PHILOSOPHY 101

A philosophy professor stood before his class. He picked up a large empty
mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the
students if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor
picked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand
filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you to
recognize that this is your life.

"The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your
health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only
they  remained, your life would still be full. The sand is everything else.
The small stuff.

"If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room  for the rocks.
The same goes for your life. If you spend all your  time and energy on the
small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to
you."

But then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor
agreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer. Of course the
beer filled the  remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full.


The moral of this tale is: That no matter how full your life is,  there is
always room for BEER.

What is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers 
are coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.

Later for now
The Looch

So what's up with you?   I hear that your company is going through a little change to put in mildly......
 
So you are still set from what Mike told me.    Dang it..... I guess you're still the rich one and I'm the pretty one..... I guess I can't be both...
 
So how is everything else? Still up for a ski trip????? I sure hope so. I don't know which I look forward to more, the ski trip or Vegas baby......   Snow Skiing is my favorite sport type activity.... unless you count Olympic "Belly wrestling"..... But the trip to Vegas was fun.....Sun and fun- plus the women are wearing less.
 
Check out the new bed I made for my guest room. I sold the last bed.  I hope Mike won't break this bed with his big women action... Oh sorry that's Brian that likes the "Full figured" women.

We ARE working!  But we don't know if we are getting paid.  We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.  But after that who knows?  They are laying off over 80% in Houston.  We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.  
 
What did you do this weekend?  Did you go out with your "friend" JP?

Bob,

This week I pick the Colts!  I'm meeting Karen tonight for dinner, so I'll tell you how that goes.  She made a comment about you yesterday, your name came up and she said "that Bob."  I said "I thought you and Bob were friends."  And she said "Oh that Bob!"  So I figure she's mad at you for, you know the "twins."  Anyway I won't say anything, so don't worry.  We moved the happy hour to next Friday 26th, so you better be there.
Maybe even "Cool River."  

Paul

I'd LOVE to be your personal assistant.  What would you like me to do first? 
  Saturday night is looking rough because my daughter Brigette, leaves for 
Sea Camp on Sunday morning, for an entire week.  Any possibility that you 
may come to the cocktail party on Friday?  Today kinda sucks, but it's

I would LOVE to meet for lunch on Wednesday!  I am so bored and lonely 
today, glad you shot me an e-mail.  Planning to go to the club later tonight 
so hopefully I'll be in prime hot tub condition!  I know I keep bugging you, 
but I can't help it.  I feel so completely isolated at times and I just keep 
reaching out.  Hope you don't mind coddling me every now and again.  I had 
such a great time last friday when I came into town for the so called 
"interview".  So nice to meet new people and hang out.  Can't wait to come 
to work with everyone, it seems like a great office.  Ready to get into an 
early morning workout regime as well, but mostly I just want something to 
fill my day.  Don't I sound pathetic today...yuck!

Subject:FW: It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown!

Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year old white male, resident of
Wimbledon, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 pm Friday. Davidson will be
charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public
intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday.

The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he
decided to stop. "You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and
there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there
wasn't," he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road,
picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a
hole in it and proceeded to satisfy his alleged "need". "I guess I was
just really into it, you know?" he commented with evident embarrassment.


In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wimbledon
Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until
officer Brenda Taylor approached him. "It was an unusual situation,
that's for sure," said officer Taylor. "I walked up to (Davidson) and
he's...just working away at this pumpkin." Taylor went on to describe
what happened when she approached Davidson.

"I just went up and said, "Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you
are screwing a pumpkin?" He got real surprised as you'd expect and then
looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it
midnight already?"

Hey baby!  I just love it when your little messages "pop" up.  I don't know 
if Mark's made up his mind yet, but I have a pretty good feeling about it.  
If (when) I officially have the job, you ought to take me out to lunch, 
seeing how you'd be one of my big, bad bosses!  Not to mention, I'm reduced 
to a poor working woman again.  Is there a dress code in the office?  What 
are your plans for later this week?

Jay,
 
We are looking to transact with this customer on a two year index purchase.  I need to discuss the details with you, but in the mean time here are the financials that they have provided.  Take a close look at them and realize this is a very rich man and he can have very bad things done to you.  So, let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements.

Guys,

Looks like Will & Paul will be arriving @ DFW around the same time on Friday.
Gonzalo was planning on picking up Paul and I think Rob's going to pick up Will,
perhaps you might want to consolidate and have 1 person pick up both Paul & Will, just
a thought.

I'm just throwing this out as an idea, but you guys work out all the details.  I have to be home between
1:00 - 4:00 for the margarita machine delivery, so I won't be able to pick anyone up.

Paul's Info:

Flt #:  1670
Time: 1:00 pm 

Paul's Pager:     888.773.1942
Paul'sMobile: 303.810.5708


Will's Info:

Rob's Cell Phone:

See you guys Friday.  Please get fresh haircuts and shower before you arrive on Friday; and as always dress to impress.

Later,

Paul,

I hope you're kidding, but you should probably go get your stuff
checked just in case.  While you're at it you might want to get the prostate
checked too; depending
on your doctor is can actually be a great experience.  My doctor is a hot
blonde female with long
skinny fingers.  Oh I think I'm feeling sick and should go see her again
soon!

Lesson learned, "If you're not going to sack it, take it home and wack it."

Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
  at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
  gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

 The question posed by St. Peter is - "What is Easter"?

 The first blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful."

 "Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - "What is Easter?"

 The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, "Do YOU know
  what Easter is?"

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, "I
  know what Easter is."

 "Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 "Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder."

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... "Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

Hello you guys,
 
Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!  You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.  Anyway I hope you're doing fine.  I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.  I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.  The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.  The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.  There are people flying in from all over the country.  Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.  It's a big pain but obliviously needed.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Go UT!
 
Paul
 
PS  We haven't found a place in Vail, but we are still looking!

The concert was great!  We had box seats so we drank for free, which is always a plus.  As far as Enron goes we definitely need this Dynegy deal!  What's up with you this weekend?  We are going to the wine tasting thing on Saturday, right?  What about Friday night want to play doctor?

..........follow. Do not walk beside me, either.
.........Just leave me the hell alone.

2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with
..........a broken fan belt and a leaky tire.

3. It's always darkest before dawn, so if you're
..........going to steal your neighbor's newspaper,

7. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.

8. It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply

..........your good qualities without your help.

10. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try
..........missing a couple of car payments.

11. Before you criticize someone, you should walk
..........a mile in their shoes. That way, when you

..........have their shoes.

12. If at first you don't succeed,
..........skydiving is not for you.

13. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.

21. The quickest way to double your money is to
..........fold it in half and put it in your pocket.

22. Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome
..........of a rain dance.

23. A closed mouth gathers no foot.

24. Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side &

          together.

25. There are two theories to arguing with women.
..........Neither one works.

26. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much
..........when your mouth is moving.

..........just after you need it.

28. Never miss a good chance to shut up.

29. We are born naked, wet, and hungry.
..........Then things get worse

On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.

Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing.  It's that simple.  Anyway as for dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if that's too late we can meet earlier.  The only thing I know that is healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big thing for you.  Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open. I'll eat anything except for Thai.  

The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.  The guy I used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.  Since I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.  But I'm sure you already know this about my personality.  I'm really not trying to BS you with my emotional side.  I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar, if you believe that to be the case. All those other delivery points need processing arrangements.  Don't tell Richard Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!

Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option, so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to stay
downtown or venture out?

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I
didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and
CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in
Austin this weekend.

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion,
do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline
delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at
Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just
got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing
you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months),
Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I
can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta
that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
"That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

"Thanks," the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

"Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster."

The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Paul,

I do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as Glen Rock is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.  We are currently trying to do these sort of Index deals for the winter and one year time periods.  Anything after that is anyone's guess.  If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.  Hope all is well, and watch out for CU!

My mom is having a party.  She has this party every year, the average
age of the party goers is about 60.  At least I can get drunk on my mom
nickel.

Ruth,

Here is the amendment to the purchase contract, please look it over.  It contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the CIG Index piece if there are additional future opportunities.  I will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have.


Paul

Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.
