Hey Hunter, how's it going? Got a favor. I am sponsoring a "Summer Series" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. 

We're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.

If you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know. Thanks!

How come Instant Messaging only works for you?  I can not find most people on the trading floor (ie., Fletch, Arnold, etc)  It is kinda of ridiculous.  
By the way, I will be on the fifth and sixth floor of the new building.  Since the Wellhead desk/ Ecommerce will be on six and the rest of Upstream Products will be on five, I will be up and down on the escalators all day.

I heard that Deirdre went to the freight group under Reck.  How do you feel about that?  Probably don't give a damn since she did not report directly to you.  However, I think it is unfortunate that she left ENA.  

I saw Elizabeth Shim today.  She told me that she gets to work by 5:00 am.  Is it really necessary?  How powerful, forcing analysts to work from 5:00 am to 6:00 pm when most of the traders leave at 4:30 pm.  HMMM,

Mrha

Can someone do a study on the tariffs of major pipeline storage fields to determine which fields require that storage gas is withdrawn regardless of price.  If not, how much to roll storage?

I was looking at past levels, and I thouhgt to share my findings with you.

Highest levels as of the first week of April was in 1999 of 1,367 TCF.  Yesterday's AGA showed our levels @ 2,294.  In order to reach 1999's levels we ould need to withdraw about 103 BCF a week (2,294 less 1,367 divided vy the remaining 9 weeks until the first week of April).  

Also, 1999 had the highest levels for the third week of January, levels were 2,039.  Year 2002 is 255 bcf ahead.

Subject:	CommodityLogic, Back-Office Commercialization and You


Over the last several months, the CommodityLogic team has designed, built, and beta-tested a number of "modules" to create EnronOnline-type capabilities for the mid and back-office.  By combining these web-based solutions with the back-office commercialization effort, Enron can now offer its clients a complete suite of operational services unique in the industry.

Many of you have also created important pieces in this puzzle, and all of you have valuable client relationships.

We'd like to put all of these elements together.

Please join our team for a demonstration of the CommodityLogic modules and a discussion on strategy next Thursday, June 14, 2:30 to 3:30, 49C1. 

If I have excluded anyone from the invitation list that you feel should attend, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you next week.

All the best,

Tom

Hi Ina, 
My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messaging software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are attending at 12.30pm. 
In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other traders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. 
11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 
12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
The latest a demo could take place is 3pm. 
Many thanks

Colin asked me to cover our current development on security.

I met with the Web Requests team yesterday and we found that our model was correct however there was an bug in the software.
We have worked through that and will do some further testing today.  If all goes well I anticipate we can define the users in the group
and implement secure links next week.

Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we =
would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT =
team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a=
 minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more dev=
elopment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operation=
al capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to acce=
ss the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David=
 also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity=
 fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built an=
d maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as wel=
l as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely =
with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage report=
s.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will =
allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products inste=
ad of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you ha=
ve any questions.

Can I get a list of the traders that will make up the new reporting list for the new company as we stand today?  We need to get new books set up, and also we need to get the V@R engine ready to go as well.

PIRA's Emissions Marketing Intelligence Service (EMIS) just released its
latest report to clients entitled, "Update: The Southern California (NOx)
RECLAIM Market."  On May 11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District
Board removed power generators, as defined under the program, from the NOx
RECLAIM market at least until 2004. However, their actions to date have left
the rest of the RECLAIM participants, such as oil refineries, facing an
ongoing, extremely tight market balance.

A second, extensive report analyzing trends and prospects in the SO2 Credit
Market will be released shortly.

Non-EMIS clients interested in the latest RECLAIM report can purchase it for
$2,000. The annual fee for quarterly EMIS reports is $4,500 for up to 10
users at one client site (office).

For more information, please contact Victoria Watkins at (212) 686-6808,

Hunter,

Thank you for your vote of confidence today.  I'm really grateful to have a shot at the trading track.  It means a lot to me and I promise to work very hard to prove myself.  

I was wondering if you would be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime over the next couple weeks.  I'd be very interested to hear your take on the trading track and what you would do if you were in my shoes.

Hello All -- Attached is a memo highlighting the issue areas covered by staff at the ICC meeting in Chicago yesterday.  If you have any questions feel free to call.  It was strange to hear Tom Kennedy say that staff supports reasonable hedging practices and forward contract purchases while sitting next to Zuraski who opposed recovery of same in the PGLC fixed price docket.  Incidentally, Tom Kennedy noted several times that hedging will not necessarily reduce prices but will stabilize them.

Hunter,
FYI - Next Tuesday we will be getting together with Tom to talk about what we will need to be prepared for in a hurricane.  We are planning to talk about the different interconnects within our region as well as the east desk, plans to replace gas, what legal considers force majeure and rankings.  I have invited the schedulers from the east and upstream desks hoping that this will help facilitate discussion and ideas on how to resolve problems should a hurricane happen.   

Kirk Lenart is also in the process of working with Unify team to create reports out of Unify to enable us to track cuts in Unify rather than on a spreadsheet.  This will be more efficient and accurate.  The code freeze on Unify will soon be lifted since the migration to the new server will happen this weekend.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions. 

Lisa

The following companies have stated that they will not execute trades with Enron.  Some of these decisions appear to be regional or product specific.  For example Aquila executed a trade in the Central region but will not trade with Sandra.

East - AEP
         Sempra
         Mirant
         J Aaron
         TXU
         Aquila 
         BP Amoco

Price - Dynegy
           Bank of Montreal
          Vitol 
          Phibro
         J Aaron

Options - Williams
              AEP
              BP Amoco
              Vitol
              Hess (will sell options only)

Central - Mirant
             Enbridge
             Vector P/L
             Transcanada
             Sempra
             BP Canada
             Coral Canada
             PG&E Trading Canada

West - Burlington
           Salt River Project
           Socal Gas
           Dynegy
           Phibro
           TXU
           Coral
           Engage
          WESCO
           Entergy-Koch
           J Aaron (They are clicking to close out positions only)
           Mirant (close out positions only)

Physical Trading

East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap

Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.

West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

AEP was noticeably absent from all regions.

Zach has gone to great efforts to evaluate his situation and experience going forward and he has decided to work with the liquidation of the EBS assets.  After seeking opinions from various business people, the overwhelming conclusion was to work with the Estate prior to entering business school in the fall.

Thank you for offering him a position and an option to join UBS, but he will officially decline the offer.

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.  Chris believes that he can create an accurate production forecast model by basin and county.  This would give us an edge in the overall and basis market.

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Guys?

Per our discussion this morning - two further items needed to complete my end of this transition of the weather team:

1)	A contact number for The Weather Channel - (770) 226-0000.  It's a switchboard number but they do have a dial by name directory - that's how I get anybody I know there.  The 2 names:  Dr. Steve Lyons and Kevin Stenson.

2)	My internet explorer bookmarks can be found at O:/Research/Bennett/Favorites.

My understanding is that this is all you guys need from me to complete my part of this transition.  Please confirm this - and let me know if/what you still need me to do.  To avoid confusion - please respond to everyone on the list above so that we can ensure that HR continues to be in the loop with this effort.

Sorry about the confusion but please let me know what further I can do - or if you are satisfied please confirm that there is nothing further that you need.



Steve

Hi Hunter,
I recently joined the A/A program as a Senior Analyst as of November 2001 on recommendations from Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, and Nicole La and I would like to speak with you on any opportunities that you may have within the Gas Fundamentals group.  I am currently working for Paul Racicot on the EBS trading desk as a metro capacity trader but I am interested in pursuing other opportunities within Enron.  I am ultimately interested in joining the Gas trading track and believe the fundamentals group would be an excellent place to start.  I've attached a copy of my resume and two recommendation letters one from Nicole La and one Joe Edwards, who heads up the bandwidth capacity trading desk, for you to review.  If you have any questions please call me at x34212.  Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, Nicole La and Joe Edwards would also be happy to speak with you regarding my performance and potential at Enron.
   
Thank-you

A number of conference participants argued that, even under the new standards of Order No. 637, many pipelines still do not offer usable (manipulatable) data over their internet sites.  

What specifically are the above participants arguing?

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical risk.   


 

Let me know if you need access to component VAR analysis, so that you can effectively manage VAR.

Due to rotations we need six analysts in Aug/Sept.  Chris has been assigned three new analysts from the pool.  I believe these people are outside of the 26 assigned to you.  We need a minimum of three.  If you want to give us up to six, we will send our allocation of three back to the pool.  We would also like a summer analyst.

FYI
This is going down.  Thinking is if VAR goes ballistic they'll know Saturday and reverse before Monday.  There are risks involved in trying this over the weekend but Scott is committed to making sure there are no hitches.

Nilay,

OK its a go. I have changed the Vol Group CD in the Publication Name database from Omicron 10 to Omicron 1 for IF-ANR/LA. Hunter's VaR is half his limit and there should be more than enough cushn' to account for any increase in VaR this change may cause. Could you ensure it comes across in the GERMS side. If it does not because of an ERMS issue, could you contact Jeremy Wong? I think you could better describe any issues to him than I could. Thanks.

Scott

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Hunter,

I spoke with Mr. Ricks about his flight schedule and he wants to drive because his wife wants join him.  I'll book him in the Doubletree Hotel for Monday.  I told him we would probably start the schedule around 9:00 a.m.  If you give me the names of those to interview him, I'll do the schedule.  I told him we would reimburse him for mileage.

Hunter, it appears that the bid week cycle for making IT based implementations actually falls five days prior and five days post bid week. Hence we cannot push the gas message board change without Director (business side) or above approval.

Thus on that note, please could forward this email to: David Wile (cc Bryan Lari, Colin Tonks, David Dronet) authorising this change so we can push the GMB asap.

Hey Hunter, how's it going? Got a favor. I am sponsoring a "Summer Series" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. 

We're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.

If you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know. Thanks!

Hunter,

Speaking with the above this morning, he indicated his interest in moving into gas as opposed to power (apparently got some good feedback on you ?!).  He currently works for Rogers Herndon and had also discussed with him his interest.

Let me have your feedback, and if you want him in your group,, I can switch him to gas fundies as opposed to power.

Karen.

ps.. attached again is the spread of new TT people.

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch

Daisy Liemonta - No - I think she is more suited towards a back office role.  However I am on the fence and If Presto wanted to bring her in, that is fine.

Eric Moncada - Yes - Trading experience and desire to learn fundamental trading

Sandy Wei-shan - No - little interest in trading

Enclosed are my notes from the discussion we had with CERA this morning. The
most important item is that CERA is revising their short-term forecast
significantly downward (from high $4.00s to high to mid $3.00s this summer).
This new forecast will be officially published next week. Please see  the

Hunter,

I spoke with Mr. Ricks about his flight schedule and he wants to drive because his wife wants join him.  I'll book him in the Doubletree Hotel for Monday.  I told him we would probably start the schedule around 9:00 a.m.  If you give me the names of those to interview him, I'll do the schedule.  I told him we would reimburse him for mileage.

Liz

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

Importance:	High


We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Hunter,

I spoke to David Woodstrom and he indicated that Rika had offered him a job in the power group?  I was wondering how they could find a spot in IT?  Just a heads up.

Interviewers:

Since Shawn Abboud was "on the bubble" after round 1 (interviewers: Grant Zimmerman and Vivek Kumar) and
Bradley Johl was not found to be strong after his round 1 telephone interview (interviewers: James Scribner and John Walt)  my recommendation to the group is to remove them from the list.  Ramsey Soliman was found to be stronger after round 1, so I think we should keep her.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

All -

Thanks again for all your help yesterday!

From our final meeting yesterday we identified 19 candidates to bring back to Super Saturday.  I can bring back no more than 17.

Based on yesterday's discussion the following candidates are "on the bubble:"

Bradley Johl
Ramsey Soliman
Shawn Abboud

We need to come to a consensus on which 2 to remove from our list.  Hopefully, we can decide this via e-mail discussions rather than calling everyone into a group meeting.

Please share your comments with the group.

Thank you!

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy created a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Dear PIRA Client,

PIRA has created a new presentation on the world economy. You can access
this presentation via PIRA Online (www.pira.com) by logging in and, from
the Client Home page, choosing "World Economy" from the "Macro Data"*
drop-down menu at the top of the screen. We have also updated the
existing slideshow accessible from the "US Economy" link.

The presentation consists of a table and charts that encapsulate GDP and
IP performance, by country/region, for 2000-2002. It is a useful
comparative recap for the existing slideshows on the U.S., European, and
Japanese economies. Given the overall importance of economic trends and
their impact on regional and global energy markets, PIRA maintains
databases of key economic indicators to support our analyses of energy
fundamentals and the associated market forecasts. These presentations -
which are updated as new data become available - are being made
available complimentarily to all PIRA Online users.

If you need a user name and password for PIRA Online, or if you need
help logging in, please contact Dyana Rothman at (212) 686-6808, email:

link, go to the FAQ page on PIRA Online and click on question number 4.)

Subject:	RE: how did your meeting w/ the lawyers go?

Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

Bob

Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we =
would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT =
team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a=
 minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more dev=
elopment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operation=
al capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to acce=
ss the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David=
 also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity=
 fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built an=
d maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as wel=
l as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely =
with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage report=
s.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will =
allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products inste=
ad of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you ha=
ve any questions.

Hello everyone.  The goal of Regulatory Affairs is to have livelink up and running for your use by no later than late November or early December.  In order to make sure you all can get into livelink without a hitch, please submit to me the list of names from your desk that will be using livelink.  They will then have guest access.  

Please submit to me the list as soon as possible.  By next Friday, November the 2nd would be wonderful.  By then, you will see or should, the livelink link in your gas fundamentals page.

Thanks,
Melinda

Cora,

Thanks for the update.  I concur with the volumes base on the contract.  

Virawan - I have hedged 4,500,000 mmbtu's.  If you decide to inject more or less than that, you will be exposed fixed price against Jan, Feb, and Mar-02.  You have a copy of the contract, however, let's go over it sometime this week.

Subject:	Michcon Storage Deal 
Importance:	High

Attached please find the storage numbers as of October 22, 2001.  The total amount we must have in storage is 4,500,000 mmbtu and if we keep going for the remainder of the month we will have a volume of 4,507,779 mmbtu which will make us over by 7,779.  We are leaving this number out there until the last day of the month in the event that we encounter any cuts between now and then.   Per the contract we must have a minimum volume of 4,250,000 but no more than 4,500,000 by October 31, 2001.  If we have at least 4,250,000 but less than 4,500,000 then Michcon will allow us to extend the injection period until November 30, 2001  However,  if we have to go into November and inject gas they will give us a fixed amount to put in every day and there will be NO variation on that amount.   Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

Cora

Hey Hunter, how's it going? Got a favor. I am sponsoring a "Summer Series" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. 

We're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.

If you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know. Thanks!

How come Instant Messaging only works for you?  I can not find most people on the trading floor (ie., Fletch, Arnold, etc)  It is kinda of ridiculous.  
By the way, I will be on the fifth and sixth floor of the new building.  Since the Wellhead desk/ Ecommerce will be on six and the rest of Upstream Products will be on five, I will be up and down on the escalators all day.

I heard that Deirdre went to the freight group under Reck.  How do you feel about that?  Probably don't give a damn since she did not report directly to you.  However, I think it is unfortunate that she left ENA.  

I saw Elizabeth Shim today.  She told me that she gets to work by 5:00 am.  Is it really necessary?  How powerful, forcing analysts to work from 5:00 am to 6:00 pm when most of the traders leave at 4:30 pm.  HMMM,

Mrha

Can someone do a study on the tariffs of major pipeline storage fields to determine which fields require that storage gas is withdrawn regardless of price.  If not, how much to roll storage?

I was looking at past levels, and I thouhgt to share my findings with you.

Highest levels as of the first week of April was in 1999 of 1,367 TCF.  Yesterday's AGA showed our levels @ 2,294.  In order to reach 1999's levels we ould need to withdraw about 103 BCF a week (2,294 less 1,367 divided vy the remaining 9 weeks until the first week of April).  

Also, 1999 had the highest levels for the third week of January, levels were 2,039.  Year 2002 is 255 bcf ahead.

Over the last several months, the CommodityLogic team has designed, built, and beta-tested a number of "modules" to create EnronOnline-type capabilities for the mid and back-office.  By combining these web-based solutions with the back-office commercialization effort, Enron can now offer its clients a complete suite of operational services unique in the industry.

Many of you have also created important pieces in this puzzle, and all of you have valuable client relationships.

We'd like to put all of these elements together.

Please join our team for a demonstration of the CommodityLogic modules and a discussion on strategy next Thursday, June 14, 2:30 to 3:30, 49C1. 

If I have excluded anyone from the invitation list that you feel should attend, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you next week.

All the best,

Tom

Hi Ina, 
My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messaging software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are attending at 12.30pm. 
In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other traders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. 
11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 
12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
The latest a demo could take place is 3pm. 
Many thanks

I met with the Web Requests team yesterday and we found that our model was correct however there was an bug in the software.
We have worked through that and will do some further testing today.  If all goes well I anticipate we can define the users in the group

Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we =
would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT =
team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a=
 minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more dev=
elopment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operation=
al capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to acce=
ss the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David=
 also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity=
 fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built an=
d maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as wel=
l as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely =
with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage report=
s.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will =
allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products inste=
ad of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you ha=
ve any questions.

PIRA's Emissions Marketing Intelligence Service (EMIS) just released its
latest report to clients entitled, "Update: The Southern California (NOx)
RECLAIM Market."  On May 11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District
Board removed power generators, as defined under the program, from the NOx
RECLAIM market at least until 2004. However, their actions to date have left
the rest of the RECLAIM participants, such as oil refineries, facing an
ongoing, extremely tight market balance.

A second, extensive report analyzing trends and prospects in the SO2 Credit
Market will be released shortly.

Non-EMIS clients interested in the latest RECLAIM report can purchase it for
$2,000. The annual fee for quarterly EMIS reports is $4,500 for up to 10
users at one client site (office).

I believe that it would either be Scott Neal or Hunter Shively.  

Did you find an unexecuted copy of the assignment?

Linda

Sylvia/Linda, do either of you know who on the ENA side would be responsible for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  HPL assigned it's expense contract with TXU Fuel Company to ENA, and I have the paperwork in front of me.  Thanks.

Hunter,

Thank you for your vote of confidence today.  I'm really grateful to have a shot at the trading track.  It means a lot to me and I promise to work very hard to prove myself.  

I was wondering if you would be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime over the next couple weeks.  I'd be very interested to hear your take on the trading track and what you would do if you were in my shoes.

Jason
