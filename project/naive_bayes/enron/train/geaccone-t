Tracy,
As Michael already told you, I am working on a valutation project for Rod, and was hoping to get cash flow (projections) for Northern Nautral and Transwestern. If you have info for EOTT also, that would be great. Otherwise, can you direct me where to get the info?
Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

Thanks,

Please see the three tabs for EGS and complete for your business unit.  I will need this back to me by 2:00 today so I can consolidate and give to Corp by 3:00.  The numbers should be the ones consolidated to Enron only.

Jim and Bob, can you complete the EGS IS tab for me for ETS and EOTT.

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

Thanks,
Steve

The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John

The attached spreadsheet shows the quarterly reclasses between O&M and COGS for Transwestern for the year 2000.  As we discussed, we are very supportive of making this 2000 reclass in order to avoid having to explain large year to year variances caused only by the re-mapping. It will also conform Enron's reporting to TW's stand-alone GAAP reporting for 2000.  Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for helping us make this happen.

   I would like to quickly recap the result of yesterday's meeting.  Your five day forecast should be input into the Treasury Forecasting Intranet Website by 3PM daily. The website address is egf.enron.com.  It is imperitive that we use the website so that all of the information is compiled in one location.
   Every payment is being scrunitized by senior management. Please understand that if your disbursements are not forecasted there is a good chance they may not be paid.  
   In order to get the ball rolling, I ask that you input your five day forecast by 12 noon today. If you have any question or concerns do not hesitate to call me. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Rod,

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Thanks
Sarah

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to you sooner on this.

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we update it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mill revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the October monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%
	Equity Ratio(equity to debt)	60%	60%	42%

2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon. 

Thanks!

Subject:	ETS resource requirements

Tracy,

I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be responsible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative.  

I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributor model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.

As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.

Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.

Thanks
Hoang Vo

Subject:	FW: Additional followup earnings release questions from Tony Jackson



Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:

1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001 was firm
     vs. interruptible?


		   	       	            2000 			            2001
  				July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
IT Percentage			.09	.09	.09	 	.10	.08	.07
Firm Percentage		.91	.91	.91		.90	.92	.93


2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001? 
 
		   			2000 			            2001
West flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.90	.95	.97 	 	 100	 100	 .91


		   			2000 			            2001
East flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.81	.85	.86	 	 100	 100	 .91

4.    On James Weitekamp's "ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights" schedule, transport 
      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference
      exist?
 
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because 
     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.

Tracy,
I've got most of the contact person and have talked to some groups and they have reduced some costs but Jim wants to meet them anyway.  So does this mean that I can go ahead and coordinate these one on one meetings for Jim?  Thanks.

Actually, we are working with each group to see why their charges are up and we are trying to get them reduced.  We will discuss with Stan at our ETS review and do further follow up if necessary.  We actually met with Terry West and Dawn Derr last week to get their input and contacts.

Tracy,
Jim had wanted to meet with the business heads that charges us thru the corp charges to hear their business justifications and assumptions used in allocating costs to us.  I just want to check if you are doing this with Stan.  If you are, then maybe Jim can just sit in the same meeting.  Please let me know.  Thank you.

Subject:	RE: Red Rock (Transwestern) Cashflow 

Palu,

Two major items affected the cashflow since August:
1.)  Air permits have been delayed from August, 2001 to November, 2001.  The delay of the air permits impacts construction start dates and delays shipment of material.  Major payments of material, equipment and construction have slipped into 2002 because of the air permit delays.  
2.)  Our compressor vendor has had a few problems.  Their payments are tied to progress.  Our current forecast represents their current payment schedule, which has slipped  as their fabrication has been delayed.

Thanks,
Steve Kalmus

The last forecast you sent the 2001 Red Rock cash flow was $40.7 million, the current forecast is $23.4 million. Please explain the difference of $ 17.3 million. This affects the TW Maketing Capital Plan for 2002.

Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco?well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa, Stephanie?the five of us?unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

Actually, I don't need your map inserted because I can't have Northern Border in it.  Can you center the one I already have in the presentations?

The project can not be justified, if you have the capital cost of the pigging facilities.  On a stand alone basis without the pigging facilities we can justify the project.

Tracy,

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.

Thanks,


John

Subject:	LaPlata DRA Application Cost Estimate

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John

FA&A will carry the depreciation - targets may be adjusted for yr to yr increase

IMP and FAS 106 will  be carried at FA&A ,Potential offsets to yr to yr increases are yet to be  determined.


Thus, the above items will not be put into the NNG Commercial Adaytum model.

I am attaching a file which was compiled a few months ago, containing the largest Enron companies earning revenues in 2000 and their respective NAICS codes.  This is not all-inclusive, but is a good start.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Good morning, Tracy!   

Stan wants us to look at the week of May 6, 2002, to travel to Europe and meet with Colin's team(s) and Adam's team(s).   See if we can hit all the necessary sites within that one week time span.

I'll await to hear back from you.

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John

Additionally, John Brindle, the cost center owner, mentioned that both Mr. Horton and Phil Lowry are aware of the group's activities and costs.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Business Controls is responsible for corporate security, including personnel, physical and technical security matters.  This involves conducting investigations, setting policies and procedures and working with appropriate security elements within the business units.  The group also coordinates and facilitates Enron's crisis response efforts.  Finally, it provides business intelligence on selected issues to senior management.

	Elizabeth,
	In the Corp. allocations there are 410,000 dollars budgeted to ETS for cc 100883.  Mr. Horton has an agreement that none of the costs from this cc shall be assessed to any of the pipes in ETS.  Please have these costs removed from your allocation to ETS.  Thank you.

	Also, can you provide me some information regarding the costs for cc 100222, Gov't Affairs Environment and cc 140196, Business Controls.  We are meeting with Mr. Horton next week and would like to provide him some explanation of the work that makes up these costs.  If you could respond by Tuesday, Oct. 9, that would be very helpful.  Thank you.

The O & M/G & A graph needs to be done in two graphs.  One for direct costs and one for Corporate costs.  This way you can better see the increase in the Corp costs.

 << File: Template.ppt >> 
Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.
  	Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly.
Please use the Arial font.
It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.

We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.

I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at
9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.  I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.

On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.

If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372.

   I would like to quickly recap the result of yesterday's meeting.  Your five day forecast should be input into the Treasury Forecasting Intranet Website by 3PM daily. The website address is egf.enron.com.  It is imperitive that we use the website so that all of the information is compiled in one location.
   Every payment is being scrunitized by senior management. Please understand that if your disbursements are not forecasted there is a good chance they may not be paid.  
   In order to get the ball rolling, I ask that you input your five day forecast by 12 noon today. If you have any question or concerns do not hesitate to call me. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco?well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa, Stephanie?the five of us?unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Subject:	Suggested Template for Lay Reviews


 
Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.
  	Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly.
Please use the Arial font.
It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.

We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.

I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at
9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.  I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.

On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.

If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372.

Subject:	2002 IM Structure

Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.

Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

Thanks, Tracy. The reclass turned out to be 43.3 mill, which is what I adjusted 3rd ce for. Is this the only adjustment you want us to make? We have a couple of other large items (goodwill, FAS 133), maybe at this point we should just include them in the current cash flow forecast. Let me know, thanks.

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to you sooner on this.

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we update it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mill revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the October monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.

I need some help on what this is.  Admittedly, it's only $117k, but we only have 3 employees, and will likely have less next year.  Can we discuss?

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Sorry for the late notice, but here's the info on September capital charge:

As was done for the 2Q flash in June, we will be using an estimate for the September Capital Charge.  However, unlike last time, we will rely on each of you to estimate your September (and Q3) capital charge, since we will be truing up to actuals YTD in October.  Please send us (myself and Terry West) what you will be incorporating into your flash.  If you have any questions, please give one of us a call.

Thanks,

Subject: Project Update


Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics
and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you
guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources
that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they
currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is
important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it
will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without
proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in
the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an
impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly
articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been
spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks,
and
result in a successful implementation.


Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier
if
you would like to discuss this.

Subject:	Adaytum Update
Importance:	High

After our meeting today Mike and I met with Pat about some of the recent Adaytum issues and I would like to update you on the progress.  

With regard to users loosing Contributor data previously entered, we believe they may not be waiting long enough after selecting Save, and closing the window before the save process is complete.  This afternoon Pat sent the detailed instructions below, stressing that users wait until they receive the Done message before closing the window.  She has asked users to let her know if they continue to have this problem.  Due to the size of our applications they do take several minutes to open and may take longer to save.

The second issue involves salary calculations in the base models in Adaytum Analyst.  Last week we corrected a formula to resolve this problem.  As it turns out the  changes made in Analyst last week are not there now.  Hoang Vo, who is in Omaha today, asked one of his Adaytum collogues, who is working on the Corporate project, to look into this.  He contacted Pat and indicated he had experienced this same problem and supplied her with a macro to run after making the changes in Analyst.  Pat updated several applications this evening and will check in the morning to see if it worked.  This issue with saving in Analyst is not related to the saving issue in Contributor.

Additionally, Contributor has not been available for several days recently.  This is due to problems with the server that is operated by Networks.  Hoang has worked with the Sunrise technical lead and Networks, and this problem is resolved.


If there any questions, please don't hesitate to call me or Pat.

Thanks, Lee

Importance:	High

PLEASE BE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW WHEN SAVING DATA YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO YOUR APPLICATION PRIOR TO EXITING:

SAVE WILL SAVE THE DATA BACK TO THE DATABASE.  THIS TAKES MORE TIME THAN WHEN YOU OPENED THE APPLICATON BECAUSE YOU ARE SENDING BACK MORE DATA.  YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE" IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER BEFORE EXITING.  THE HOUR GLASS MAY STOP RUNNING, BUT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE", IT IS NOT FINISHED SAVING ALL THE DATA.

 << OLE Object: Paintbrush Picture >> 
 DONE


If you have any questions or experience any further lost data, please call me.
Thanks,
Pat

Subject:	Capacity Subscription Strategy

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

I believe in 2001 it was $5.5.  Clean Fuels and HPL received some in 2001 and not any in 2002.

Our budget for SAP was $700,000 for 2001.  Has it really gone up that much ($6,000,000 divided by four is $1,500,000)?

The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.


Thanks

Gary Anderson indicated you needed TW fuel numbers for last two years.

Gas Accounting has a data file of compressor useage by compressor by month.

We can provide the information if you let me know who to contact.

How much is TPC's current Fair Value balance?  The banks want to exclude "goodwill" from the tangible net worth computation - I realize goodwill and fair value are slightly different but they could make the argument to exclude.  I seem to recall a $300MM number.

Subject:	Questar Southern Trails Due Diligence


The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Stan needs to see before we turn into Corp. or Wholesale.  Lets wait before we turn into Corp.  What is the last number turned into Corp for the 4 Q?  We really need to run Corp planning requests through Rod and myself to make sure we have Stan's okey.  I would hate for him to be surprised.  Thanks.

We are turning into Corp today, (3CE), (34.9).  This is a variance of (8.3) to what you have below.

NEPCO = (8.5) - due to project profit adjustments on LS Power/Kendall, IL, Cogentrix/Jenks, OK, and E.Coast Power/Linden, NJ.
EEOS =      .2 - Puerto Rico 2.0, Bonus accrual (1.0), and misc. other (.8).

FYI,  We are currently looking at the NEPCO projects to see if they require further writedowns.

Are we reporting the 4Q through EGS and not Wholesale?  Please let me know.

Would you be able to meet with Jerry before the Budget Meeting with Mr. Horton?  Jerry said that a breakfast meeting would work for him.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  FYI, Jerry will be staying at the Doubletree Hotel the night before (Oct. 11).

Thank you, both.

Tracy,  We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Standby.  Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere in ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital Budget.  Can you confirm this?

I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS.  I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level.  We will need to work with Tracy on this.

If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know.

$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Subject:	Adaytum Update
Importance:	High

After our meeting today Mike and I met with Pat about some of the recent Adaytum issues and I would like to update you on the progress.  

With regard to users loosing Contributor data previously entered, we believe they may not be waiting long enough after selecting Save, and closing the window before the save process is complete.  This afternoon Pat sent the detailed instructions below, stressing that users wait until they receive the Done message before closing the window.  She has asked users to let her know if they continue to have this problem.  Due to the size of our applications they do take several minutes to open and may take longer to save.

The second issue involves salary calculations in the base models in Adaytum Analyst.  Last week we corrected a formula to resolve this problem.  As it turns out the  changes made in Analyst last week are not there now.  Hoang Vo, who is in Omaha today, asked one of his Adaytum collogues, who is working on the Corporate project, to look into this.  He contacted Pat and indicated he had experienced this same problem and supplied her with a macro to run after making the changes in Analyst.  Pat updated several applications this evening and will check in the morning to see if it worked.  This issue with saving in Analyst is not related to the saving issue in Contributor.

Additionally, Contributor has not been available for several days recently.  This is due to problems with the server that is operated by Networks.  Hoang has worked with the Sunrise technical lead and Networks, and this problem is resolved.


If there any questions, please don't hesitate to call me or Pat.

Thanks, Lee

PLEASE BE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW WHEN SAVING DATA YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO YOUR APPLICATION PRIOR TO EXITING:

SAVE WILL SAVE THE DATA BACK TO THE DATABASE.  THIS TAKES MORE TIME THAN WHEN YOU OPENED THE APPLICATON BECAUSE YOU ARE SENDING BACK MORE DATA.  YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE" IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER BEFORE EXITING.  THE HOUR GLASS MAY STOP RUNNING, BUT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE", IT IS NOT FINISHED SAVING ALL THE DATA.

If you have any questions or experience any further lost data, please call me.

I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if that date won't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably about 3 hours or so.    I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

Thanks.

Please see Debra Thompson's note below regarding not setting up FAR orders for floor space billing. I also received a message from Billie Akhave stating EPSC will not be billing to FAR orders -- only company/cost centers.

The last information I had was that all pipeline company employees' space should be billed to FAR orders. Has this changed?

Maria,  See the attached.  I believe you will set up the co. 0062 and 0085 FAR orders.

Miriam, I believe you will set up the co. 1195 FAR orders but you need to check with Silvia first.  I think you will also set up the co. 0584 FAR orders but check with Barney first.

Ruthann,
Although there are people in the co. 0584 cost centers right now, they are in the process of being moved to other pipeline companies by 01/01/2002.  There will be no employees on co. 0584 after the first of the year.

Thanks to all,
Pat

We have been instructed to begin charging all floor space and related charges to FAR orders for all pipeline employees. I was advised that the FAR orders to be used should be xxxx20009999, which is "G&A Custom Variant - Asset Not Specific".

I've looked up all xxxx20009999 FAR orders in SAP and determined which cost centers for Houston employees need to have this FAR order set up. Attached is a spreadsheet showing the FAR orders which need to be created.

Please call me if you need any additional information, and let me know when the FAR orders are created.

Thanks for your help.

Tracy-

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the number from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.  The correct total is (19.0).

Rod and I are meeting with Stan Monday afternoon, October 22, to talk about the 4th Quarter.  I have listed below the latest IBIT impact to Enron for the 4th Quarter that I have.  Please let me know if there are any changes and provide any variance explanations if necessary.  

PGG  $28.0
EREC $53.2
Azurix  ($24.2) including Marlin
Clean fuels ($21.1)
EGAS  ($14.1)
EEOS ($26.6)

Thanks

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

I have attached the current estimate.  I am not sure it is right because I was confused on how they have been booking it.  I feel comfortable that the total year is right.  Its the line that totals $118 for the year.

Sorry for the late notice, but here's the info on September capital charge:

As was done for the 2Q flash in June, we will be using an estimate for the September Capital Charge.  However, unlike last time, we will rely on each of you to estimate your September (and Q3) capital charge, since we will be truing up to actuals YTD in October.  Please send us (myself and Terry West) what you will be incorporating into your flash.  If you have any questions, please give one of us a call.

Thanks,
Steve and Terry

Subject: Project Update


Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and
result in a successful implementation.


Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if
you would like to discuss this.

Subject:	Information Request

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

Thanks,
Steve

I would use this along with the O & M schedules we sent you earlier.  If anyone wants more detail they need to go directly to Stan Horton or Brain Stanely.  Apparantly they have already worked up a plan.

After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being amortized in 2002.  We need to take that out of your numbers.  Jim and Kiri thought it was approximately $14 million.  Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of $270.  Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach thanks.

Hi Tracy,

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow
morning.  This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not
previously budgeted.  It also has a more detail break-out of capital
expenditures.

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out
for our cost as you have requested.  Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is
not condusive to SAP type sorting.

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late
November.  There will be significant swing between quarters from these results
to the final one.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco?well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa, Stephanie?the five of us?unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

I don't know how to get in touch with Mike outside of the office.  Can you wait until MOnday?  If not, I can try information in Omaha.

Tracy,
Joe Darensbourg called me today asking about some invoices he received from Adaytum for Contributor Administrator and Advanced Analyst training that I am scheduled to take.  I told him that I had already expensed and sent a check to Adaytum for these two classes.
He, Joe, called me later to ask if I had coded this training to one of the Adaytum projects, namely an O&M project.  I told him I did not.  He said he would send me an email with the project(s) number(s).  I haven't received it as yet.
Lee wants to be sure that you are aware of this since we don't have any way of monitoring what is coming from Adaytum direct to Enron.
Thanks,
Pat

Pat,

Thanks for letting me know about the Adaytum invoice issue that Joe Darensbourg contacted you about.  I have not been involved in any of the invoicing with Adaytum, Tracy Geaccone is handling that for ETS. 

Would you please e-mail Tracy and let her know the particulars of this issue.   I assume Joe has taken care of it, but I would like to keep her in the loop on any cost or invoice issues.

Thanks.

Tracy:

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!

I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.

We can go over Lay review ideas again then.  The agenda for November 1 has you at 4:30 Houston time.  Will that work for you?  If not, are you comfortable with Tod doing it.

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement trading activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancler)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

Remaining:
Fund brokerage contracts with $500,000 margin requirement (we are paid 95% of the 30 day T-bill rates on the account)

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of our business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I have the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisiness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectives.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans please let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the brokerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Kent

Tracy,

As you know Project Sunrise no longer has within its scope the development of a process for bi-directional data flow between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse, at a level sufficient for ETS.  Because of this the EST IT group is now exploring solutions that will achieve what is needed.  Considering we thought this was being worked on by Sunrise, until a few weeks ago, we have a great deal more work ahead of us than earlier expected.

In Operations we will need Hoang Vo working on our project until the end of April 2002 at a minimum.  He is currently scheduled to roll of the project at the end of January.  We need to get with Adaytum and reserve this additional time.  Do you want to do that or would you rather to go ahead and work with Fred Ali to make the arrangements.

Thanks, Lee

Importance:	High



Henry Baker will email you no later than  each Thursday morning with the last "Summary" with the YTD and QTR info section titles adjusted accordingly.  This next one will be October month forecast.  The YTD will be September YTD with the Actual line reading Actual/Forecast since September is not yet finalized.  When we are at the end of a QTR (like now) and forecasting the first month of the next QTR I will add a section for the next QTR (in this case 4th QTR).

This week's template follows:
 << File: WeeklyWeb100501.XLS >> 
Please fill in your company's data on the template and return by email to Henry Baker no later than 3:00 pm on each Thursday.

The report will be titled "Weekly Commercial Net Contribution Summary" and will ultimately reside in the ETS Updates, Financial Forecasts section of the ETS Website.  Also, keep submitting and inputing into the Website the more detailed weekly reports as you have been.  We will not be publishing the Summary by email but watch for it on the Website.  The way the Website works, it might not show up until Friday morning.  If you need an advance copy, let Henry know and he can email it to you.

Also, when filling in your variances, watch for rounding issues where it might show up as zeroes but the totals would foot differently when adding the visual amounts.

Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to.  The total cost of his trip was $1603.28

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Tracy,  We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Standby.  Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere in ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital Budget.  Can you confirm this?

I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS.  I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level.  We will need to work with Tracy on this.

If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know.

$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.

Could we have a telephone call and discuss what our slides should look like for this presentation.  I assume we will try to make the presentation for the respective pipelines look similar -  as much as possible.  Let me know when you are available.   I have time today from 1:00 to 2:00 and about 4:30.  Tomorrow I am free most of the day. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I am working with Rod on this one.  LEts try Thursday afternoon? 


I also would like to know if our timeline has changed  -( 9/22 with Stan and 11/8 with Mr. Lay) [Geaccone, Tracy]  Do you mean 10/22.  I will put something out on this this afternoon. 


Lastly, is there an expectation for the Quarter Forecast?  Right now, NNG Commercial is showing a September upside as well as an October upside.  We plan to offset all but $500,000 in the November / December time frame.   While we would be up for the period from Sept-Dec by the $500,000, we would be down for the fourth quarter. [Geaccone, Tracy]    Are you sure you are ready to commit to this.  Can you make it up?

You are so good to me!  As long as we are together, it does not really matter where we stay.  I would prefer a king size bed as opposed to two double.  Although, if we mess up one, we can always use the other one.  The Lay Reviews are supposed to be over at 5:00, so any time after that.  I don't really have a preference on the return flight. 

Love you

Do you have a preference as to which hotel we stay in? I checked the Bellagio and they are very proud of their hotel that week ($380/night). The Venetian is kind of steep too but about $100/night cheaper. Other choices that I think would be nice would be the MGM Grand or the Mirage. Just let me know what you want. Also, I need to probably book the flights so let me know what time you want to leave and come back. Thanks. Love you babe.

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

 Tracy,
Attached is the 4th quarter forecast for EGAS.  It is essentially 4Q from 3CE.  This does not include gain/loss on assets sale which right now it would be Greenfield Shipping loss and EcoElectrica gain.  I'll find out the latest for those numbers  .  Please forward this to Steven Schwarzbach if everything looks OK.  Thank you.

Attached are the latest revised Corporate Assessments for 2002.  There have been some minor changes but the major update is to the Click at Home program.  Remember that the Click at Home program assesses actual dollars so the numbers included in the spreadsheet are estimates for planning purposes.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement trading activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancler)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

Remaining:
Fund brokerage contracts with $500,000 margin requirement (we are paid 95% of the 30 day T-bill rates on the account)

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of our business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I have the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisiness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectives.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans please let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the brokerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Kent

Tracy,
Here is Cal's resume. We would appreciate any help you could give him. He is available to come by and meet anyone you would think appropriate in the intern process. Please advise us what we should do next. He is working up here to get some experience but very interested in any prospects you might have at Enron. Thanks, Tracy!

I really miss you, too.  I hope you had a good lunch.  Mine was quite an experience.  I will tell you later.  Did you spill anything on your clothes today?

Love you,

Subject:	FW: Weekly Commercial Net Contribution Summary 
Importance:	High



Henry Baker will email you no later than  each Thursday morning with the last "Summary" with the YTD and QTR info section titles adjusted accordingly.  This next one will be October month forecast.  The YTD will be September YTD with the Actual line reading Actual/Forecast since September is not yet finalized.  When we are at the end of a QTR (like now) and forecasting the first month of the next QTR I will add a section for the next QTR (in this case 4th QTR).

This week's template follows:
 << File: WeeklyWeb100501.XLS >> 
Please fill in your company's data on the template and return by email to Henry Baker no later than 3:00 pm on each Thursday.

The report will be titled "Weekly Commercial Net Contribution Summary" and will ultimately reside in the ETS Updates, Financial Forecasts section of the ETS Website.  Also, keep submitting and inputing into the Website the more detailed weekly reports as you have been.  We will not be publishing the Summary by email but watch for it on the Website.  The way the Website works, it might not show up until Friday morning.  If you need an advance copy, let Henry know and he can email it to you.

Also, when filling in your variances, watch for rounding issues where it might show up as zeroes but the totals would foot differently when adding the visual amounts.

Subject:	Oasis Dairy Farms Judgement

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Subject:	Oneok Claim on EPPI


EPPI Claim for 2000-2001

Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.


Prior Claim (1997-1999)

On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.

During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

Thanks,

FYI.    This is my story for now, but I think it explains the volumes and the rates as well as the revenue projections.   Please note we have found a bust in 2002 revenue.   This yields a higher answer without any additional volumes being used.

Still no progress on settling Coyonosa with Duke.  Is this matter reserved?  My files indicate our total exposure on the unpaid invoices is close to $800,000.  Thanks. DF

Actually, we are working with each group to see why their charges are up and we are trying to get them reduced.  We will discuss with Stan at our ETS review and do further follow up if necessary.  We actually met with Terry West and Dawn Derr last week to get their input and contacts.

Tracy,
Jim had wanted to meet with the business heads that charges us thru the corp charges to hear their business justifications and assumptions used in allocating costs to us.  I just want to check if you are doing this with Stan.  If you are, then maybe Jim can just sit in the same meeting.  Please let me know.  Thank you.

Elaine,
I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.
Thanks, 
Nancy

Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.
  	Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly.
Please use the Arial font.
It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.

We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.

I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at
9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.  I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.

On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.

If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372.

Well, the stock price is down $1 and some change because of the 3Q 10Q.  I went over the 4Q numbers with Stan.  He was ok with them.  I am either sitting in for him or accompanying him to the Whalley meeting today.  Enron announced they are going to have layoffs next week.  I am sure you have seen the e-mail.  The office is quiet.  How are things going up there?  Are you leaving this afternoon?

Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

Tracy,

Attached is the file you requested.  I have made substantial assumptions regarding the requested content, and the content provided may not be what was intended to be requested.

Please note the following:

- The EREC earnings figures are from the Hyperion system as of Oct. 19th
- The 2001-02 Expenses are from the 3CE and 2002 Plan respectively.  The cost-type breakdown requested is not available.
- The cash burn rate is net and ties to the change in the Enron Working Capital line balance by period. I do not have visibility to the gross outflows due to format differences.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks.

Chris

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848.

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures. 

We will follow up next week with the breakout of each company. 

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Rod and Tracy-

We are trying to plan for the 4th current estimate, and are looking at when our monthly reports roll in (around the 15th of December).  Can you give me guidance as to when we are due to give you our 4CE??  Hopefully, after the 15th will work.

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

1.  Per the latest rate cases the nominal ROE's and related capital structures are as follows:


	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%
	Equity Ratio(equity to debt)	60%	60%	42%

2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon.

Elaine,
I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.

If they can split by business unit they must have by company.  The FERC nor the partnerships will accept these charges unless we have the data to send the costs to them.  I really need something like yesterday.  I thought we had this resolved a long time ago.

The ISC does not have this information below the business unit level.  HR may be able to match the p-numbers up to company in a semi-automated fashion.  Or, you could use the number of documents and master data as the bases and exclude the user counts in the weighting.

Tracy,

These are the statistics provided by Chris Schlaudraff.

 << File: ISC Allocation Metrics.xls >> This is a recap at the business unit level.  The business unit allocation is weighted as follows:
			29.27% based on how many licenses we have.
			53.41% based on how many documents we have on the system.
			17.32% based on the amount of CO data (or master data) we have on the system.

 << File: Stats by company for ETS.xls >> This is the detail of the documents (# of FI docs & # of PO docs columns) and the CO data (all other columns) ETS has on the system.....by company.

 << File: ISC ets licenses.xls >>   This is a list of the ETS users/licenses.  It is not by company.  

Let me know if you have any questions,
Greg

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Subject:	RE: NNG & TW Ad Valorem Tax Accrual - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast

Property tax liability, in a given tax year i.e. 2002, is directly related to the level of income and asset cost of the prior calendar year i.e. 2001.  As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefore, property taxes also will increase.

In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are available (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), (2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not capitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.

The 2002 Plan reflects an annual property tax accrual increase for both companies of approximately $1.0 MM (NNG $.3 MM and TW $.7 MM) above what is presently being accrued on each company this year. Would you please respond to Tracy on the reasons for the increase between years and also provide a possible strategy for keeping the accrual flat. She will need your response by Friday to cover any question/concerns Stan may have after his review this weekend. Thanks in advance for your cooperation and support.

Could we have a telephone call and discuss what our slides should look like for this presentation.  I assume we will try to make the presentation for the respective pipelines look similar -  as much as possible.  Let me know when you are available.   I have time today from 1:00 to 2:00 and about 4:30.  Tomorrow I am free most of the day. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I am working with Rod on this one.  LEts try Thursday afternoon? 


I also would like to know if our timeline has changed  -( 9/22 with Stan and 11/8 with Mr. Lay) [Geaccone, Tracy]  Do you mean 10/22.  I will put something out on this this afternoon. 


Lastly, is there an expectation for the Quarter Forecast?  Right now, NNG Commercial is showing a September upside as well as an October upside.  We plan to offset all but $500,000 in the November / December time frame.   While we would be up for the period from Sept-Dec by the $500,000, we would be down for the fourth quarter. [Geaccone, Tracy]    Are you sure you are ready to commit to this.  Can you make it up?

I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!

Tracy,
As Michael already told you, I am working on a valutation project for Rod, and was hoping to get cash flow (projections) for Northern Nautral and Transwestern. If you have info for EOTT also, that would be great. Otherwise, can you direct me where to get the info?
Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

Thanks,

Please see the three tabs for EGS and complete for your business unit.  I will need this back to me by 2:00 today so I can consolidate and give to Corp by 3:00.  The numbers should be the ones consolidated to Enron only.

Jim and Bob, can you complete the EGS IS tab for me for ETS and EOTT.

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

Thanks,
Steve

The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John

As we discussed, we are very supportive of making this 2000 reclass in order to avoid having to explain large year to year variances caused only by the re-mapping. It will also conform Enron's reporting to TW's stand-alone GAAP reporting for 2000.  Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for helping us make this happen.

   I would like to quickly recap the result of yesterday's meeting.  Your five day forecast should be input into the Treasury Forecasting Intranet Website by 3PM daily. The website address is egf.enron.com.  It is imperitive that we use the website so that all of the information is compiled in one location.
   Every payment is being scrunitized by senior management. Please understand that if your disbursements are not forecasted there is a good chance they may not be paid.  
   In order to get the ball rolling, I ask that you input your five day forecast by 12 noon today. If you have any question or concerns do not hesitate to call me. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Rod,

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Thanks
Sarah

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to you sooner on this.

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we update it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mill revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the October monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

1.  Per the latest rate cases the nominal ROE's and related capital structures are as follows:


	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%
	Equity Ratio(equity to debt)	60%	60%	42%

2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon. 

Thanks!

Subject:	ETS resource requirements

Tracy,

I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be responsible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative.  

I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributor model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.

As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.

Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.

Thanks
Hoang Vo
